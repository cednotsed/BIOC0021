They are extremely diverse and have not been associated with any disease so far. Strikingly, these small entities infect most probably the complete human population, and there are no convincing examples demonstrating viral clearance from infected individuals. The main transmission could be via fecal-oral or airway route, as infections occur at an early age. However, due to the lack of an appropriate culture system, the virus-host interactions remain enigmatic. Anelloviruses are obviously mysterious viruses, and their impact on human life is not yet known, but, with no evidence of a disease association, a potential beneficial effect on human health should also be investigated.																	0168-6445	1574-6976				MAY	2020	44	3					305	313		10.1093/femsre/fuaa007							WOS:000562458600002	32188999					J	Altan, E; Dib, JC; Gulloso, AR; Juandigua, DE; Deng, XT; Bruhn, R; Hildebrand, K; Freiden, P; Yamamoto, J; Schultz-Cherry, S; Delwart, E				Altan, Eda; Dib, Juan Carlos; Gulloso, Andres Rojas; Juandigua, Duamaco Escribano; Deng, Xutao; Bruhn, Roberta; Hildebrand, Kristen; Freiden, Pamela; Yamamoto, Janie; Schultz-Cherry, Stacey; Delwart, Eric			Effect of Geographic Isolation on the Nasal Virome of Indigenous Children	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY												The influence of living in small remote villages on the diversity of viruses in the nasal mucosa was investigated in three Colombian villages with very different levels of geographic isolation. Metagenomic analysis was used to characterize viral nucleic acids in nasal swabs from 63 apparently healthy young children. Sequences from human virus members of the families Anelloviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Herpesviridae, Polyomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae were detected in decreasing proportions of children. The number of papillomavirus infections detected was greater among Hispanic children most exposed to outside contacts, while anellovirus infections were more common in the isolated indigenous villages. The diversity of the other human viruses detected did not differ among the villages. Closely related variants of rhinovirus A or B were identified in 2 to 4 children from each village, reflecting ongoing transmission clusters. Genomes of viruses not currently known to infect humans, including members of the families Parvoviridae, Partitiviridae, Dicistroviridae, and Iflaviridae and circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) virus, were also detected in nasal swabs, possibly reflecting environmental contamination from insect, fungal, or unknown sources. Despite the high levels of geographic and cultural isolation, the overall diversity of human viruses in the nasal passages of children was not reduced in highly isolated indigenous villages, indicating ongoing exposure to globally circulating viruses. IMPORTANCE Extreme geographic and cultural isolation can still be found in some indigenous South American villages. Such isolation may be expected to limit the introduction of otherwise common and widely distributed viruses. Very small population sizes may also result in rapid local viral extinction due to a lack of seronegative subjects to maintain transmission chains for rapidly cleared viruses. We compared the viruses in the nasal passages of young children in three villages with increasing levels of geographic isolation. We found that isolation did not reduce the overall diversity of viral infections. Multiple infections with nearly identical rhinoviruses could be detected within each village, likely reflecting recent viral introductions and transmission clusters among epidemiologically linked members of these very small communities. We conclude that, despite their geographic isolation, remote indigenous villages show evidence of ongoing exposure to globally circulating viruses.

Composite Analysis of the Virome and Bacteriome of HIV/HPV Co-Infected Women Reveals Proxies for Immunodeficiency	VIRUSES-BASEL												The human cervical microbiome is complex, and its role in health and disease has just begun to be elucidated. In this study, 57 cervical swab samples from 19 HIV/HPV co-infected women were analyzed for both virome and bacteriome composition. Virome analysis focused on circular DNA viruses through rolling circle amplification followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Data were assigned to virus families and genera, and HPV types were identified. NGS data of bacterial 16S from a subset of 24 samples were assigned to operational taxonomic units and classified according to vaginal microbiome community state types (CSTs). Four viral families were found: Papillomaviridae, Anelloviridae, Genomoviridae, and Herpesviridae. Papillomavirus reads were more abundant in women with premalignant cervical lesions, which were also strongly associated with multiple (3) high-risk HPV infection. Anellovirus read abundance was negatively correlated with host CD4+ T-cell counts. The bacteriome revealed the presence of CST III and CST IV, and women with 1% frequency of genomovirus or herpesvirus reads displayed an increased risk of carrying CST IV. By characterizing the composition of the cervical circular DNA viruses and the bacteriome of HIV/HPV co-infected women, we identified putative interactions between these two microorganism communities and their associations with patients' clinical characteristics, notably immunodeficiency status.

To explore a possible viral implication, we investigated the virome of cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 70 febrile pediatric inpatients with clinical compatible encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Using viral metagenomics, we detected and genetically characterized three novel human Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) species (TTMV-G1-3). Phylogenetically, TTMV-G1-3 clustered in three novel monophyletic lineages within genus Betatorquevirus of the Anelloviridae family. TTMV-G1-3 were highly prevalent in diseased children, but absent in the healthy cohort which may indicate an association of TTMV species with febrile illness. With 2/3 detected malaria co-infection, it remains unclear if these novel anellovirus species are causative agents or increase disease severity by interaction with malaria parasites. The presence of the viruses 28 days after initiating antimalarial and/or antibiotic treatment suggests a still active viral infection likely as effect of parasitic and/or bacterial co-infection that may have initiated a modulated immune system environment for viral replication or a defective virus clearance. This study increases the current knowledge on the genetic diversity of TTMV and strengthens that human anelloviruses can be considered as biomarkers for strong perturbations of the immune system in certain pathological conditions.

Due to an important diversity, the comprehensive characterization of this viral family over time has been poorly studied. To overcome this challenge, we used a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach with the aim of determining the individual anellovirus profile of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) patients. We conducted a prospective pilot study on a homogeneous patient cohort regarding the chemotherapy regimens that included 10 ASCT recipients. A validated viral mNGS workflow was used on 108 plasma samples collected at 11 time points from diagnosis to 90 days post-transplantation. A complex interindividual variability in terms of abundance and composition was noticed. In particular, a strong sex effect was found and confirmed using quantitative PCR targeting torque teno virus, the most abundant anellovirus. Interestingly, an important turnover in the anellovirus composition was observed during the course of the disease revealing a strong intra-individual variability. Although more studies are needed to better understand anellovirus dynamics, these findings are of prime importance for their future use as biomarkers of immune competence.

Nonetheless, over the past 5 years, there has been a concerted effort using viral metagenomics approaches to identify and characterize viruses associated with Antarctic pinniped and avian species. Here we used a viral metagenomics approach to identify circular DNA viruses in buccal swab samples from Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on Livingston Island, Antarctica during the 2016/2017 field season. We identified two new lineages of anelloviruses, torque teno Arctocephalus gazella virus (TTAgV)-1 (2083 nts) and -2 (2127-2143 nts), which are most closely related to and cluster with a previously identified anellovirus associated with California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) sharing similar to 60% genome-wide pairwise identity. The ORF1 of TTAgVs share 26-41% amino acid similarity to the ORF1 of other previously identified pinniped-associated anelloviruses.

The anelloviruses isolated from mammals are currently classified into 11 assigned and four proposed genera; some anelloviruses remain unassigned. The present study was conducted to identify anelloviruses in wild-caught masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in Japan using a rolling-circle amplification method. Thirteen novel anellovirus strains were identified from 8 of 10 masked palm civets and their entire genomic sequences (2039-2535 nucleotides) were determined; they were classifiable into four distinct clades. Comparative analyses of all reported anelloviruses for which the entire or near-entire genomic sequences have been determined, including the 13 strains obtained in the present study, revealed that anelloviruses can provisionally be classified into 20 clades, which may correspond to 20 genera (including 11 assigned and four proposed genera) by a > 70% amino acid sequence difference in open reading frame 1 (ORF1). This study suggested that novel anelloviruses of marked diversity are circulating in animals worldwide, and that the rolling-circle amplification method would be useful for identifying novel anelloviruses and other viruses with a circular DNA genome.

We used metagenomic sequencing to detect both known and yet unknown microorganisms in 2 nested case control studies of MS. Two different cohorts were followed for MS using registry linkages. Serum samples taken before diagnosis as well as samples from matched control subjects were selected. In cohortl with 75 cases and 75 controls, most viral reads were Anelloviridae-related and > 95% detected among the cases. Among samples taken up to 2 years before MS diagnosis, Anellovirus species TTMV1, TTMV6 and TTV27 were significantly more common among cases. In cohort2, 93 cases and 93 controls were tested under the pre-specified hypothesis that the same association would be found. Although most viral reads were again related to Anelloviridae, no significant case-control differences were seen. We conclude that the Anelloviridae-MS association may be due to multiple hypothesis testing, but other explanations are possible.

Colonization is a continuous process that starts very early in life and occurs thanks to shrewd strategies microbes have evolved to tackle a convoluted array of anatomical, physiological, and functional barriers of the human body. Cumulative evidence shows that viruses are part of the microbiome. This part, called virome, has a dynamic composition that reflects what we eat, how and where we live, what we do, our genetic background, and other unpredictable variables. Thus, the virome plays a chief role in shaping innate and adaptive host immune defenses. Imbalance of normal microbial flora is thought to trigger or exacerbate many acute and chronic disorders. A compelling example can be found in the respiratory apparatus, where early-life viral infections are major determinants for the development of allergic diseases, like asthma, and other non-transmissible diseases. In this review, we focus on the virome and, particularly, on Anelloviridae, a recently discovered virus family. Anelloviruses are major components of the virome, present in most, if not all, human beings, where they are acquired early in life and replicate persistently without causing apparent disease. We will discuss how modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems by Anelloviruses can influence the development of respiratory diseases in childhood and provide evidence for the use of Anelloviruses as useful and practical molecular markers to monitor inflammatory processes and immune system competence.

They have been found in many vertebrate hosts including primates. In this study, we describe the application of the high-throughput sequencing to examine the frequency and diversity of anelloviruses in rodents, bats and opossums captured in Sao Paulo State, Brazil. We report a total of twenty-six anelloviruses with sixteen nearly complete genomes and ten partial genomes, which include eleven potential novel species identified in rodents (Cricetidae), bats (Molossidae and Phyllostomidae), and opossums (Didelphidae). We also propose the inclusion of two potential new genera within the Anelloviridae family, provisionally named Omegatorquevirus and Sigmatorquevirus, including six and three novel species of anelloviruses, respectively. In summary, this study expands the diversity and the host range of the known anelloviruses.

Viral infections have become a potential threat to the health of these endangered animals, but limited information related to these infections is available. Methods: Using a viral metagenomic approach, we surveyed viruses in the feces, nasopharyngeal secretions, blood, and different tissues from a wild giant panda that died from an unknown disease, a healthy wild giant panda, and 46 healthy captive animals. Results: The previously uncharacterized complete or near complete genomes of four viruses from three genera in Papillomaviridae family, six viruses in a proposed new Picornaviridae genus (Aimelvirus), two unclassified viruses related to posaviruses in Picornavirales order, 19 anelloviruses in four different clades of Anelloviridae family, four putative circoviruses, and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described Genomoviridae family were sequenced. Reflecting the diet of giant pandas, numerous insect virus sequences related to the families Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iridoviridae, Baculoviridae, Polydnaviridae, and subfamily Densovirinae and plant viruses sequences related to the families Tombusviridae, Partitiviridae, Secoviridae, Geminiviridae, Luteoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae; genus Umbravirus, Alphaflexiviridae, and Phycodnaviridae were also detected in fecal samples. A small number of insect virus sequences were also detected in the nasopharyngeal secretions of healthy giant pandas and lung tissues from the dead wild giant panda. Although the viral families present in the sick giant panda were also detected in the healthy ones, a higher proportion of papillomaviruses, picornaviruses, and anelloviruses reads were detected in the diseased panda. Conclusion: This viral survey increases our understanding of eukaryotic viruses in giant pandas and provides a baseline for comparison to viruses detected in future infectious disease outbreaks. The similar viral families detected in sick and healthy giant pandas indicate that these viruses result in commensal infections in most immuno-competent animals.

In an effort to identify viruses associated with Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) inhabiting the Ross Sea, vaginal and nasal swabs, and faecal samples were collected between November 2014 and February 2015. In addition, a Weddell seal kidney and South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) faeces were opportunistically sampled. Using high throughput sequencing, we identified and recovered 152 anellovirus genomes that share 63-70% genome-wide identities with other pinniped anelloviruses. Genome-wide pairwise comparisons coupled with phylogenetic analysis revealed two novel anellovirus species, tentatively named torque teno Leptonychotes weddellii virus (TTLwV)-1 and -2.

TTV possesses microRNA (miRNA)-coding sequences that might be involved in viral immune evasion. Here, the presence of TTV DNA and miRNAs expression was investigated in plasma samples of 77 diseased (20 infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 18 infected with hepatitis B (HBV) virus, 18 infected with hepatitis C (HCV) virus, 21 solid organ transplanted) patients, and 25 healthy controls. ITV prevalence was significantly different in healthy controls (60%, 15/25) versus diseased patients (80%, 62/77), showing the highest TTV loads in transplant recipients. Genetic TTV analysis showed the highest prevalence of group 1, followed by groups 3, 4 and 5, and a lack of isolates of group 2. The expression of at least one ITV miRNAs of group 1, 3 and 5 was found in exosomes of plasma of the great majority of individuals (96%, 98/102 subjects) showing the higher prevalence of miRNAs of TTV group 3 (90%, 92/102), followed by miRNAs of group 1 (66%, 67/102), and miRNA of group 5 (49%, 50/102). TTV miRNAs expression and TTV viremia were not always directly correlated, and significant differences appeared in production of some ITV miRNAs between healthy controls and diseased patients. The reported ITV miRNAs status in exosomes encourages further investigation to understand their potential role in the expansion of anelloviruses upon immunosuppression. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Infections and co-infections by different genotypes in humans are ubiquitous. Related viruses were described in number of mammalian hosts, but very limited data are available from the closest human relatives - great apes and non-human primates. Here we report the 100% prevalence determined by semi-nested PCR from fecal samples of 16 captive primate species. Only the Mandrillus sphinx, showed the prevalence only 8%. We describe three new species of gorillas' and four new species of chimpanzees' Betatorqueviruses and their co-infections in one individual. This study is also first report and analysis of nearly full length TTMV genomes infecting gorillas. Our attempts to sequence the complete genomes of anelloviruses from host feces invariably failed. Broader usage of blood /tissue material is necessary to understand the diversity and interspecies transmission of anelloviruses. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Detection of Torque teno midi virus/Small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) in the sera of domestic village chickens and its vertical transmission from hen to eggs	IRANIAN JOURNAL OF VETERINARY RESEARCH												Although the infection of different animals and non-human primates with other members of Anelloviridae have already been reported there is no report about infection of animals with Torque teno midi virus/Small anellovirs (TTMDV/SAV). The aim of this study was to detect the virus in domestic village chickens. Blood samples were collected from 79 domestic village chickens in Isfahan. Blood samples of five adult laying hens and one cockerel were collected in three consecutive weeks (days 1, 8 and 14) as experimental chickens. Ten eggs were randomly collected from the eggs laid during days 12 to 17 and thin and thick egg whites and yolk samples were collected aseptically. After DNA extraction Nested-PCR was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers. In PCR, 431 bp and 441 bp products were detected. The detected bands were extracted and sequenced. Totally 26 out of 79(32.9%) of the blood samples were positive for the virus. The frequency of the infection of the different parts of the eggs tested was 76%. For the first time TTMDV/SAV was detected in domestic village chickens which also vertically transmitted to eggs.																	1728-1997					WIN	2015	16	1					110	113									WOS:000367865500019	27175162					J	Fatholahi, M; Bouzari, M				Fatholahi, Maryam; Bouzari, Majid			Torque Teno Midi Virus/Small Anellovirus in Sera of Healthy, HIV/HCV and HIV Infected Individuals in Lorestan Province, Iran	JUNDISHAPUR JOURNAL OF MICROBIOLOGY												Background: Torque Teno Midi Virus/Small Anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the Gammatorquevirus genus within the family Anelloviridae. It is detected in healthy, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus and HIV infected individuals and also patients with acute respiratory disease in different countries, but its role in clinical diseases and its full geographical distribution is still unclear. Objectives: The current study aimed to detect the frequency of infection with TTMDV/SAV in the sera of healthy blood donors, hepatitis C infected and HIV positive individuals in Lorestan province, Iran; and also investigate the possible role of TTMDV/SAV virus in liver diseases. Materials and Methods: Fifty two, 36, 4, and 110 serum samples from HIV positive, patients with HIV/HCV and HIV/HCV/HBV co-infections, and healthy individuals were collected in Khorramabad city, respectively. Nested-polymerase chain reaction was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers to detect TTMDV/SAV DNA. Serum aminotransferases were measured. Results: In the HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HIV, and control cases, 29 (80.5%), 3 (75%), 43 (82.7%), and 16 (14.5%) were positive for DNA of TTMDV/SAV, respectively. In the HIV/HCV infected cases and HIV positive cases the level of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly different in TTMDV/SAV infected and non-infected individuals (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Although significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed in the frequency of TTMDV/SAV between healthy controls and each of the HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, no significant difference was observed between HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected cases, which may be due to HIV associated immunodeficiency. This is the first time that TTMDV/SAV is reported in HIV infected individuals worldwide. Interpretation of the high frequency of the virus (82.7%) in HIV cases needs more detailed studies.																	2008-3645	2008-4161				NOV	2015	8	11							e25368	10.5812/jjm.25368							WOS:000368533400012	26862377					J	Canuti, M; van Beveren, NJM; Farsani, SMJ; de Vries, M; Deijs, M; Jebbink, MF; Zaaijer, HL; van Schaik, BDC; van Kampen, AHC; van der Kuyl, AC; de Haan, L; Storosum, JG; van der Hoek, L				Canuti, Marta; van Beveren, Nico J.

In this study VIDISCA, a virus discovery method, was used in combination with Roche-454 high-throughput sequencing as a tool to determine the possible presence of viruses (known or unknown) in blood of first-onset drugs-naive schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms. Two viruses (the Anellovirus Torque Teno virus and GB virus C) were detected. Both viruses are commonly found in healthy individuals and no clear link with disease was ever established. Viruses from the family Anelloviridae were also identified in the control population (4.8%). Besides, one patient sample was positive for human endogenous retroviruses type K (HML-2) RNA but no specific predominant strain was detected, instead 119 different variants were found. In conclusion, these findings indicate no evidence for viral or endogenous retroviral involvement in sera at the time of onset of schizophrenia. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Currently, little is known about swine immune response against TTSuV infections. In this study, an ELISA assay was developed based on the ORF1-A recombinant protein of two known TTSuVs, namely TTSuV1 (genus lotatorquevirus) and TTSuV2 (genus Kappatorquevirus). The assay was used to study the development of the humoral immune response against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in longitudinally sampled clinically healthy pigs and their dams. Anti ORF1-A IgG was found in serum of pigs and sows for both TTSuVs. From 15 sows, 15 (100%) and 13 (83%) had anti ORF1-A IgG against TTSuV1 and ITSuV2, respectively. Pig sero-prevalences at the first sampling (4 weeks of age) were 65% (24/37) and 5% (2/37) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. For TTSuV1, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at weeks 21 and 25, with 68% (25/37) sero-positive pigs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results at week 21 revealed that 26 out of 32 (81%) pigs were positive for TTSuVl. In the case of TTSuV2, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at week 21, with 84% (31/37) pigs being sero-positive. At the same week, 92% (34/37) of pigs were qPCR positive. In summary, anti ORF1-A IgGs were detected in both sows and piglets at different ages, indicating that these animals could mount a humoral immune response against both TTSuVs. However, the high percentage of viremic pigs in presence of anti ORF1-A IgG suggests that these antibodies are not able to remove TTSuVs from circulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Full-length sequences of TTSuVk2b were obtained, annotated and used in the phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that TTSuVk2b is a novel Anellovirus species within the genus Kappatorquevirus of the family Anelloviridae. Quantitative PCR techniques were developed to determine total TTSuV DNA quantities as well as the prevalence and viral DNA quantities of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b. The mean total TTSuV load in seven commercial sera was determined at 6.3 log(10) DNA copies ml(-1) of serum, with TTSuVk2b loads being the lowest at 4.5 log(10) DNA copies ml(-1) of serum. Subsequently, prevalence and loads of TTSuVs were determined in pig sera from 17 countries. TTSuVk2b prevalence ranged from 0 to 100% with viral loads from 3.3 to 4.6 log(10) copies ml(-1) of sera. TTSuVk2a, so far the only species in the genus Kappatorquevirus, has been linked to an economically important swine disease, namely post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Considering the grouping of TTSuVk2b. in the same genus as TTSuVk2a, TTSuVk2b prevalence and viral DNA load were determined in PMWS-affected animals and healthy counterparts. This revealed that TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b are not only genetically related, but also that their viral loads in serum are elevated in PMWS animals compared with those of healthy pen mates. In summary, the present work describes a novel TTSuV species including its genetic characterization, epidemiological assessment and potential disease association.

Increased Prevalence of Anellovirus in Pediatric Patients with Fever	PLOS ONE												The Anelloviridae family consists of non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. Three genera of anellovirus are known to infect humans, named TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV. Although anelloviruses were initially thought to cause non-A-G viral hepatitis, continued research has shown no definitive associations between anellovirus and human disease to date. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients 2-36 months of age. We determined that although anelloviruses were present in a large number of specimens from both febrile and afebrile patients, they were more prevalent in the plasma and nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. Using PCR to detect each of the three species of anellovirus that infect humans, we found that anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV were more prevalent in the plasma and NP specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. This was not the case for species TTMV which was found in similar percentages of febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of plasma and NP specimens containing anellovirus increased with age until patients were 19-24 months of age, after which the percentage of anellovirus positive patient specimens dropped. This trend was striking for TTV and TTMDV and very modest for TTMV in both plasma and NP specimens. Finally, as the temperature of febrile patients increased, so too did the frequency of TTV and TTMDV detection. Again, TTMV was equally present in both febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Taken together these data indicate that the human anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV are associated with fever in children, while the highly related human anellovirus TTMV has no association with fever.

Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer after breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of infection by these viruses in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women from Isfahan, Iran. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from cervical cancers (n = 42) and cervicitis cases (n = 79) were subjected to nested PCR to identify TTMDV/SAV viral sequences. Of the 42 tumor cases, 22, 18 and 2 were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. In total, 23 (55%) of the tumor samples were positive for TTMDV/SAV. Of the 79 cervicitis cases, 38 (48%) were also positive for TTMDV/SAV.

It has a single-stranded, circular, negative-sense DNA genome. Its pathogenic role in human disease remains to be confirmed. In this study, viral shedding, molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTMDV/SAV were studied in human body fluids. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with acute respiratory disease were tested by PCR/nested PCR for TTMDV/SAV in two seasons (2005/2006, 2006/2007). Two years later, additional urine, stool, and serum samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from eight symptomless children for follow-up investigation. Forty-three (46.7%) of the 92 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected contained TTMDV/SAV. High genetic diversity was observed; however, identical sequences were also detected in two patients. The mean age of the infected children was 3 years (1 months-8 years), and 58% of them were female. Co-infection with RSV was detected in 23% of the samples. In a follow-up study, nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum of six (75%), stool samples of four (50%) and urine samples of two (25%) of the eight children were anellovirus-positive. None of the anellovirus sequences were identical in the two collection periods, but identical sequences were detected in different body fluids collected at the same time from the same child. TTMDV/SAVs shedding was detected in four human body fluids. As a consequence, it is possible that generalized infection and fecal/uro-oral transmission of TTMDV/SAV occur. TTMDV/SAVs are frequently present in nasopharyngeal aspirates, although the variants may only be transient agents. Further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis and pathogenic role of TTMDV/SAV.
