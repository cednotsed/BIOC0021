AB  - A viral metagenomics study was conducted in beef, pork, and chicken sold in supermarkets from Southern Brazil. From chicken, six distinct gyroviruses (GyV) were detected, including GyV3 and GyV6, which for the first time were detected in samples from avian species, plus a novel smacovirus species and two highly divergent circular Rep-encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) viruses. From pork, genomes of numerous anelloviruses, porcine parvovirus 5 (PPV5) and 6 (PPV6), two new genomoviruses and two new CRESS-DNA viruses were found. Finally, two new CRESS-DNA genomes were recovered from beef. Although none of these viruses have history of transmission to humans, the findings reported here reveal that such agents are inevitably consumed in diets that include these types of meat. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Crab-eating (Cerdocyon thous) and Pampas foxes (Lycalopex gymnocercus) are wild canids distributed in South America. Domestic dogs (Canis lupus familiaris) and wild canids may share viral pathogens, including rabies virus (RABV), canine distemper virus (CDV), and canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2). To characterize the virome of these wild canid species, the present work evaluated the spleen and mesenteric lymph node virome of 17 crab-eating and five Pampas foxes using high-throughput sequencing (HTS). Organ samples were pooled and sequenced using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Additional PCR analyses were performed to identify the frequencies and host origin for each virus detected by HTS. Sequences more closely related to the Paramyxoviridae, Parvoviridae and Anelloviridae families were detected, as well as circular Rep-encoding single-stranded (CRESS) DNA viruses. CDV was found only in crab-eating foxes, whereas CPV-2 was found in both canid species; both viruses were closely related to sequences reported in domestic dogs from southern Brazil. Moreover, the present work reported the detection of canine bocavirus (CBoV) strains that were genetically divergent from CBoV-1 and 2 lineages. Finally, we also characterized CRESS DNA viruses and anelloviruses with marked diversity. The results of this study contribute to the body of knowledge regarding wild canid viruses that can potentially be shared with domestic canids or other species. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: An infectious etiology has been proposed for many human cancers, but rarely have specific agents been identified. Viral metagenomic technique is useful for identification of viral pathogens potentially existing in bone marrow specimens from hematologic patients. Methods: A total of 24 patients were included in this study, including 14 female (58.3 %) and 10 male patients (41.7 %) with a mean age of 55.20 ± 18.02 years (16–89 years).Twenty-four bone marrow specimens were collected from 24 hematologic patients (diagnosed with hypoferric anemia, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myelo-monocytic leukemia, acute myelocytic leukemia with maturation, multiple myeloma, lymphoma angioimmunoblastic T cell, acute myeloid leukemia-M1, polycythemia vera/hypoferric anemia, leukocythemia, or megaloblastic anemia). Viral nucleic acid from marrow samples of hematologic patients were subjected to viral metagenomic analysis. PCR method was used to investigate the prevalence of these new viruses in this cohort of hematologic patients. Phylogenetic tree was established to elucidate the relationship of anelloviruses found here and the previously define ones. Results: Anelloviridae family are the main group of viruses detected in all the 4 libraries. Forty-six different species of Anelloviruses belonging to genera Alphatorquevirus, Betatorquevirus and Gammatorquevirus and unclassified anellovirus were recovered. Fifteen novel strains with complete ORF1 coding sequence were acquired and phylogenetically analyzed, indicating 8 of the 15 strains are proposed novel species belonging to genus Gammatorquevirus. Nested-PCR were then performed for these15 novel anellovirus strains in the 24 individual bone marrow samples, which showed 13 of them were present in more than one bone marrow samples. Conclusions: Diverse types of anellovirus were present in bone marrow samples of hematologic patients. Whether these novel anelloviruses have association with certain hematonosis needs further investigation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and previous pandemics have been viewed almost exclusively as virology problems, with toxicology problems mostly being ignored. This perspective is not supported by the evolution of COVID-19, where the impact of real-life exposures to multiple toxic stressors degrading the immune system is followed by the SARS-CoV-2 virus exploiting the degraded immune system to trigger a chain of events ultimately leading to COVID-19. This immune system degradation from multiple toxic stressors (chemical, physical, biological, psychosocial stressors) means that attribution of serious consequences from COVID-19 should be made to the virus-toxic stressors nexus, not to any of the nexus constituents in isolation. The leading toxic stressors (identified in this study as contributing to COVID-19) are pervasive, contributing to myriad chronic diseases as well as immune system degradation. They increase the likelihood for comorbidities and mortality associated with COVID-19. For the short-term, tactical/reactive virology-focused treatments are of higher priority than strategic/proactive toxicology-focused treatments, although both could be implemented in parallel to reinforce each other. However, for long-term pandemic prevention, toxicology-based approaches should be given higher priority than virology-based approaches. Since current COVID-19 treatments globally ignore the toxicology component almost completely, only limited benefits can be expected from these treatments. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The role of the microbiome in liver transplantation (LT) outcome has received a growing interest in the past decades. In contrast to bacteria, the role of endogenous viral communities, known as the virome, is poorly described. Here, we applied a viral metagenomic approach to study the dynamic evolution of circulating viruses in the plasma of LT recipients and its effect on the clinical course of patients. Methods: Patients chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) that received a LT due to endstage liver disease were included in this study. Longitudinal plasma samples were collected pre- and post-LT. Intact viral particles were isolated and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Short read libraries were analysed with an in-house bioinformatics pipeline. Key endpoints were the dynamics of viral families and post-LT complications. Findings: The initiation of immunosuppression induced a bloom of the Anelloviridae that dominated the post-LT plasma virome. A variety of post-LT complication were observed. Nephrotoxicity was reported in 38% of the patients and was associated with a high abundance of anelloviruses. Besides nephrotoxicity, 16 (67%) patients experienced flares of viral or bacterial infections in post-transplant follow-up. These flares were recognized by an increased burden of anelloviruses (p < 0.05). Interestingly, no mortality was observed in patients infected with human pegivirus. Interpretation: These findings suggest a diagnostic potential for the Anelloviridae family in post-LT complications. Furthermore, the impact of human pegivirus infection on post-transplant survival should be further investigated. Funding: This trial was supported by Gilead Sciences grant number BE-2017-000133. © 2020 The Authors

AB  - Objectives: Torquetenovirus (TTV) is an emerging marker of functional immune competence with the potential to predict transplant-related adverse events. A large-scale epidemiological study was performed to understand how basal values vary in healthy individuals according to age and gender. Methods: We tested plasma from 1017 healthy blood donors aged 18–69 years. The presence and load of TTV were determined by a real-time PCR assay. A sub-cohort of 384 donors was tested for anti-cytomegalovirus IgG antibodies, and 100 participants were also tested for TTV viraemia on a paired whole blood sample. Results: The overall prevalence of TTV was 65% (657/1017) with a mean (±SD) growth of 5 ± 4% every 10 years of age increase, but stably higher in males (465/690, 67%) than in females (192/327, 59%). Mean (±SD) TTV load was 2.3 ± 0.7 Log copies/mL with no sex difference. TTV viraemia showed modest increases along 10-year age intervals (mean ± SD: 0.3 ± 0.1). TTV viraemia in donors sampled 2 years later remained stable (mean ± SD: 2.3 ± 0.8 versus 2.2 ± 0.7 Log copies between samples). Twenty-six per cent (9/34) of blood donors with TTV-negative plasma scored positive when whole blood was tested, and the donors with positive plasma showed a mean (±SD) 1.4 ± 0.5 Log increase in copy numbers when whole blood was tested. Conclusions: This study establishes the mean value of TTV viraemia in plasma in healthy blood donors and suggests that ageing causes only minimal increases in TTV viraemia. © 2020 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases

AB  - Wild birds carry a number of infectious agents, some of which may have pathogenic potential for the host and others species, including humans. Domestic pigeons (Columba livia) are important targets of study since these increasingly cohabit urban spaces, being possible spillover sources of pathogens to humans. In the present study, two genomes (PiGyV_Tq/RS/Br and PiGyV_RG/RS/Br), representative of Gyrovirus genus, family Anelloviridae, were detected in sera of free-living pigeons collected in Southern Brazil. The genomes exhibit less than 50% identity to previously described members of Gyrovirus genus, suggesting that they constitute a new viral species circulating in pigeons, to which the name “pigeon gyrovirus (PiGyV)” is proposed. The current study characterizes these two PiGyV genomes which, to date, are the first gyrovirus species identified in domestic pigeons. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are small, ubiquitous, viruses with a highly diverse, single-stranded, negative sense DNA genome and wide host range. They are detected at high rates in both healthy and diseased individuals and are considered a significant part of the mammalian virome. Similar to human TTVs, swine TTVs (TTSuVs) are epidemiologically linked to several coinfections including porcine circovirus types 2 and 3 and the porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome virus. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with TTSuVs resulted in lesions in multiple organs and exacerbation of coinfections, making TTSuVs the only members of the Anelloviridae family with experimental evidence for pathogenicity. However, due to the lack of reliable cell culture and animal models, mechanistic studies on viral immunity and pathogenesis are limited. The objective of this review is to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding the biology, detection, pathogenesis and public health significance of TTSuVs, while identifying gaps in knowledge which limit the field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Respiratory virus infections are one of the major causes of acute respiratory disease or exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, next-generation sequencing has not been used for routine viral detection in clinical respiratory samples owing to its sophisticated technology. Here, several pharyngeal samples with COPD were collected to enrich viral particles using an optimized method (M3), which involved M1 with centrifugation, filtration, and concentration, M2 (magnetic beads) combined with mixed nuclease digestion, and M4 with no pretreatment as a control. Metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatics analyses showed that the M3 method for viral enrichment was superior in both viral sequencing composition and viral taxa when compared to M1, M2, and M4. M3 acquired the most viral reads and more complete sequences within 15-h performance, indicating that it might be feasible for viral detection in multiple respiratory samples in clinical practice. Based on sequence similarity analysis, 12 human viruses, including nine Anelloviruses and three coronaviruses, were characterized. Coronavirus OC43 with the largest number of viral reads accounted for nearly complete (99.8%) genome sequences, indicating that it may be a major viral pathogen involved in exacerbation of COPD. © Copyright © 2020 Liu, Shao, Wang, Zhou, Su, Dong, Sun, Li, Zhang and Yang.

AB  - Brazil is a major exporter of pork meat worldwide. Swine liver is a common ingredient in food consumed by humans, thus emphasizing the importance of evaluating the presence of associated pathogens in swine liver. To obtain knowledge, this study aimed to provide insights into the viral communities of livers collected from slaughtered pigs from southern Brazil. The 46 livers were processed and submitted for high-throughput sequencing (HTS). The sequences were most closely related to Anelloviridae, Circoviridae and Parvoviridae families. The present work also describes the first Brazilian PCV1 and the first PPV6 and PPV7 from South America. Virus frequencies revelead 63% of samples positive for TTSuV1, 71% for TTSuVk2, 10.8% for PCV, 13% for PPV and 6% for PBov. This report addresses the diversity of the liver virome of healthy pigs and expands the number of viruses detected, further characterizing their genomes to assist future studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Dental pulp with special structure has become a good reference sample in paleomicrobiology-related blood-borne diseases, many pathogens were detected by different methods based on the diagnosis of nucleic acids and proteins. Objectives: This review aims to propose the preparation process from ancient teeth collection to organic molecule extraction of dental pulp and summary, analyze the methods that have been applied to detect septicemic pathogens through ancient dental pulps during the past 20 years following the first detection of an ancient microbe. Methods: The papers used in this review with two main objectives were obtained from PubMed and Google scholar with combining keywords: “ancient,” “dental pulp,” “teeth,” “anatomy,” “structure,” “collection,” “preservation,” “selection,” “photography,” “radiography,” “contamination,” “decontamination,” “DNA,” “protein,” “extraction,” “bone,” “paleomicrobiology,” “bacteria,” “virus,” “pathogen,” “molecular biology,” “proteomics,” “PCR,” “MALDI-TOF,” “LC/MS,” “ELISA,” “immunology,” “immunochromatography,” “genome,” “microbiome,” “metagenomics.”. Results: The analysis of ancient dental pulp should have a careful preparation process with many different steps to give highly accurate results, each step complies with the rules in archaeology and paleomicrobiology. After the collection of organic molecules from dental pulp, they were investigated for pathogen identification based on the analysis of DNA and protein. Actually, DNA approach takes a principal role in diagnosis while the protein approach is more and more used. A total of seven techniques was used and ten bacteria (Yersinia pestis, Bartonella quintana, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Salmonella enterica serovar Paratyphi C, Mycobacterium leprae, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Rickettsia prowazeki, Staphylococcus aureus, Borrelia recurrentis, Bartonella henselae) and one virus (Anelloviridae) were identified. Y. pestis had the most published in quantity and all methods were investigated for this pathogen, S. aureus and B. recurrentis were identified by three different methods and others only by one. The combining methods interestingly increase the positive rate with ELISA, PCR and iPCR in Yersinia pestis diagnosis. Twenty-seven ancient genomes of Y. pestis and one ancient genome of B. recurrentis were reconstructed. Comparing to the ancient bone, ancient teeth showed more advantage in septicemic diagnosis. Beside pathogen identification, ancient pulp help to distinguish species. Conclusions: Dental pulp with specific tissue is a suitable sample for detection of the blood infection in the past through DNA and protein identification with the correct preparation process, furthermore, it helps to more understand the pathogens of historic diseases and epidemics. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - Anelloviruses are small, single stranded circular DNA viruses. They are extremely diverse and have not been associated with any disease so far. Strikingly, these small entities infect most probably the complete human population, and there are no convincing examples demonstrating viral clearance from infected individuals. The main transmission could be via fecal-oral or airway route, as infections occur at an early age. However, due to the lack of an appropriate culture system, the virus-host interactions remain enigmatic. Anelloviruses are obviously mysterious viruses, and their impact on human life is not yet known, but, with no evidence of a disease association, a potential beneficial effect on human health should also be investigated. © FEMS 2020.

AB  - An unexplained outbreak of feline diarrhea and vomiting, negative for common enteric viral and bacterial pathogens, was subjected to viral metagenomics and PCR. We characterized from fecal samples the genome of a novel chapparvovirus we named fechavirus that was shed by 8/17 affected cats and identified three different feline bocaviruses shed by 9/17 cats. Also detected were nucleic acids from attenuated vaccine viruses, members of the normal feline virome, viruses found in only one or two cases, and viruses likely derived from ingested food products. Epidemiological investigation of disease signs, time of onset, and transfers of affected cats between three facilities support a possible role for this new chapparvovirus in a highly contagious feline diarrhea and vomiting disease. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded, circular DNA virus of the family of Anelloviridae. The first contact with TTV usually occurs in early childhood, followed by persistent infection in bone marrow and lymphocytes. Increased levels of TTV-DNA are found in the serum in various states of immune deficiency. The objective of this study was to assess if monitoring of TTV viremia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a predictive marker for immune-related clinical complications. In a retrospective study, 2054 whole-blood samples from 123 patients were tested for viral loads of TTV-DNA by real-time PCR within 345 days after allo-HSCT. We enrolled all patients who underwent allo-HSCT between September 2015 and April 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and statistically analyzed. Patients with an underlying lymphatic malignancy had significantly higher torque teno (TT) viral loads compared with patients with an underlying malignant myeloid disease (P < .05). Complete remission before allo-HSCT correlated significantly with higher TT viral loads after allo-HSCT (P < .05). Myeloablative conditioning regimens led to significantly higher TT viral loads than reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (P < .05). A higher anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) dose was associated with a significantly higher TT viral load. We did not observe any significant differences of TT viral load correlating with accompanying clinically relevant events such as virus reactivations (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Adenovirus), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), relapse, or death. TT viral load after allo-HSCT did weakly correlate with T cell, T suppressor cell, T helper cell, and natural killer and B cell count. Although statistically significant differences between study groups were observed, virus reactivations, aGVHD, and clinical outcomes could not be predicted by monitoring TTV viremia. Therefore, TTV seems not to be suitable as a marker for the degree of immunosuppression or as a prognostic marker for clinically critical events in patients after allo-HSCT. © 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV), torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) are members of the family Anelloviridae that are known to infect humans. Although no pathogenic roles have been associated with anelloviruses, their high prevalence and perceived ubiquitousness have provoked scientific interest in understanding their molecular and biological characteristics. We used nested PCR to determine the prevalence of anelloviruses among 130 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and 130 healthy blood donors, and analyzed three near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates from HIV-infected and non-HIV infected Nigerians. Statistical analysis showed that the rate of TTV infection was significantly higher in the HIV-infected group (65%) than in the blood donor group (26%) (p &lt; 0.05, χ2 = 40.3). TTMV and TTMDV infections were very high in both groups, ranging between 88 and 95%. No significant association was found between TTV infection and age, sex, CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. Near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates FL100, FL08 and BD67 determined by next-generation sequencing were 3.6 kb, 3.2 kb and 2.9 kb, respectively, in size. Their GenBank accession numbers are MK820644, MK820645, MK820646, respectively. These isolates shared 59% sequence identity across the whole genome and clustered in two different phylogenetic groups. Our study established for the first time the circulation of TTV, TTMV and TTMDV in the Nigerian population, with a disproportionately higher prevalence of TTV in HIV-infected patients. The near-complete TTV genome sequences from Nigeria are similar to the sequences KT163879 and KT163916 (3748 and 3190 respectively), obtained from the plasma of HIV-infected subjects from the United States, and EU305675 (2919), identified in human plasma samples from France. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Although millions of distinct virus species likely exist, only approximately 9000 are catalogued in GenBank’s RefSeq database. We selectively enriched for the genomes of circular DNA viruses in over 70 animal samples, ranging from nematodes to human tissue specimens. A bioinformatics pipeline, Cenote-Taker, was developed to automatically annotate over 2500 complete genomes in a GenBank-compliant format. The new genomes belong to dozens of established and emerging viral families. Some appear to be the result of previously undescribed recombination events between ssDNA and ssRNA viruses. In addition, hundreds of circular DNA elements that do not encode any discernable similarities to previously characterized sequences were identified. To characterize these ‘dark matter’ sequences, we used an artificial neural network to identify candidate viral capsid proteins, several of which formed virus-like particles when expressed in culture. These data further the understanding of viral sequence diversity and allow for high throughput documentation of the virosphere. © 2020, eLife Sciences Publications Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether timing of the initiating event of spontaneous labor (either uterine contractions with intact fetal membranes or rupture of membranes prior to labor (PROM)) is associated with maternal viral infection. It was a prospective case control study of women with either spontaneous labor or PROM occurring < 37 weeks’ gestation (“cases”) or at term (“controls”). An initial unbiased screen for viruses was performed with next-generation sequencing (NGS) in serum pooled from eight cases delivered by C/S and represents a range of gestational ages, membrane rupture status, and presence or absence of chorioamnionitis. Custom PCR was used to query individual patient samples from the original cohort. The NGS screen generated 15 million reads. Seven unique viral sequences were detected in two cases, all identified as torque teno virus (TTV), an ubiquitous DNA anellovirus of no known pathogenicity. Using nested and semi-nested PCR, sera from 72 patients (47 cases and 25 matched controls, stratified by ROM status) were screened for the 3 subtypes of anelloviruses (TTV, TTMDV, or TTMV). These were found in 43/47 cases (91%) and 16/25 controls (64%) (p = 0.012, OR = 5.9 (95% CI = 1.4–29.9)). In logistic regression, pregnant women with at least one type of anellovirus were more likely to experience preterm labor than those with no anellovirus (p = 0.03, aOR = 4.6, CI = 1.2–18.7). Among women experiencing a spontaneous initiating event of labor, TTV virus was more likely to be present in the serum of preterm than term patients. TTV may have a role in determining the timing of parturition. © 2020, Society for Reproductive Investigation.

AB  - Sapajus nigritus are non-human primates which are widespread in South America. They are omnivores and live in troops of up to 40 individuals. The oral cavity is one of the main entry routes for microorganisms, including viruses. Our study proposed the identification of viral sequences from oral swabs collected in a group of capuchin monkeys (n = 5) living in a public park in a fragment of Mata Atlantica in South Brazil. Samples were submitted to nucleic acid extraction and enrichment, which was followed by the construction of libraries. After high-throughput sequencing and contig assembly, we used a pipeline to identify 11 viral families, which are Herpesviridae, Parvoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Caulimoviridae, Iridoviridae, Astroviridae, Poxviridae, and Baculoviridae, in addition to two complete viral genomes of Anelloviridae and Genomoviridae. Some of these viruses were closely related to known viruses, while other fragments are more distantly related, with 50% of identity or less to the currently available virus sequences in databases. In addition to host-related viruses, insect and small vertebrate-related viruses were also found, as well as plant-related viruses, bringing insights about their diet. In conclusion, this viral metagenomic analysis reveals, for the first time, the profile of viruses in the oral cavity of wild, free ranging capuchin monkeys. © 2020, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

AB  - A study was conducted to investigate the serum virome of sows with and without stillbirths after farrowing. Sera from sows with at least one stillbirth or with normal litters were collected immediately after farrowing. Viral DNA was extracted from serum pools and submitted to high throughput sequencing. No differences in the proportion of virus-related reads were found in both groups (p > 0.05). A variety of viral DNA genomes were identified, mostly representative of three viral families: Anelloviridae, Circoviridae and Smacoviridae. Besides, a number of novel unclassified circular Rep-encoding single stranded DNA (CRESS DNA) viruses were also identified. These findings suggest that the presence of such viral genomes in sows’ sera bears no correlation with stillbirths’ occurrence; it seems likely that these constitute part of the normal serum microbiome of sows at farrowing. © 2020 Tochetto et al.

AB  - Viruses are ubiquitous in nature; however, very few have been identified in the Leporid species. In the fall of 2018, an outbreak of myxomatosis in Iberian hares (Lepus granatensis) was reported in Spain and a novel recombinant myxoma virus strain (MYXV-Tol) was identified. To investigate variability within the recombinant region of the MYXV-Tol and identify any potential viral coinfections, samples (ear, eyelid or vaginal) of Iberian hares were collected from Spain and analyzed. The presence of the recombinant region of the MYXV-Tol was confirmed in six out of eleven samples analyzed. Additionally, a polyomavirus (family Polyomaviridae), representing a putative new species, and anelloviruses (family Anelloviridae) belonging to two putative species were identified, some as coinfection with the recombinant MYXV-Tol. The two polyomavirus genomes were identified in two hares and share >99% genome-wide identity. Based on the analysis of their large T-antigen, the new polyomavirus clusters in a distant clade from other mammals sharing <64% amino acid identity. A total of 14 anelloviruses were identified, which share 63-99% genome-wide identity. Overall, our results show a coinfection of different DNA viruses in the studied samples and raise awareness regarding the extensive unsampled diversity of viruses in hares. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - In clinical virome research, whole-genome/transcriptome amplification is required when starting material is limited. An improved method, named “template-dependent multiple displacement amplification” (tdMDA), has recently been developed in our lab (Wang et al. in BioTechniques 63:21–25. https://doi.org/10.2144/000114566, 2017). In combination with Illumina sequencing and bioinformatics pipelines, its application in virome sequencing was explored using a serum sample from a patient with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In comparison to an amplification-free procedure, virome sequencing via tdMDA showed a 9.47-fold enrichment for HCV-mapped reads and, accordingly, an increase in HCV genome coverage from 28.5% to 70.1%. Eight serum samples from acute patients liver failure (ALF) with or without known etiology were then used for virome sequencing with an average depth at 94,913x. Both similarity-based (mapping, NCBI BLASTn, BLASTp, and profile hidden Markov model analysis) and similarity-independent methods (machine-learning algorithms) identified viruses from multiple families, including Herpesviridae, Picornaviridae, Myoviridae, and Anelloviridae. However, their commensal nature and cross-detection ruled out an etiological interpretation. Together with a lack of detection of novel viruses in a comprehensive analysis at a resolution of single reads, these data indicate that viral agents might be rare in ALF cases with indeterminate etiology. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The viral load of the ubiquitous and nonpathogenic torque teno virus (TTV) is associated with the grade of immunosuppression of its host. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allowed to describe the human virome of the blood compartment in transplanted patients, and showed that TTV is the most important part of the virome. This study is a descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. Descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. After sample processing, nucleic acids were amplified by rolling circle amplification and submitted to NGS by ion proton sequencing technology. Results were analyzed after mapping of reads on the 29 TTV reference genomes and de novo assembling of the reads with MIRA software. The number of TTV species present in donors and recipients was, on average, 12 in donors and 33 in recipients. TTV species predominantly present in donors were TTV-13 and TTV-18; and in recipients were TTV-P15-2, TTV-27, TTV-HD14a, and TTV-22. We highlighted a significant variability in abundance and composition in sequential samples from recipients. Temporal evolution of TTV populations was clearly observed in recipients, but no preferential transmission of a species from donor to recipient was evidenced. Diversity and population expansion were observed in kidney recipients. Further study of TTV species could help assess the potential impact of each species of this virus. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Viral primary infections and reactivations are common complications in patients after solid organ transplantation (SOT) and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Among these patients, viral infections are frequently associated with viremia. Beyond the usual well-known viruses that are part of the routine clinical management of transplant recipients, numerous other viral signatures or genomes can be identified in the blood of these patients. The identification of novel viral species and variants by metagenomic next-generation sequencing has opened up a new field of investigation and new paradigms. Thus, there is a need to thoroughly describe the state of knowledge in this field with a review of all viral infections that should be scrutinized in high-risk populations. Here, we review the eukaryotic DNA and RNA viruses identified in blood, plasma, or serum samples of pediatric and adult SOT/HSCT recipients and the prevalence of their detection, with a particular focus on recently identified viruses and those for which their potential association with disease remains to be investigated, such as members of the Polyomaviridae, Anelloviridae, Flaviviridae, and Astroviridae families. Current knowledge of the clinical significance of these viral infections with associated viremia among transplant recipients is also discussed. To ensure a comprehensive description in these two populations, individuals described as healthy (mostly blood donors) are considered for comparative purposes. The list of viruses that should be on the clinicians’ radar is certainly incomplete and will expand, but the challenge is to identify those of possible clinical significance. © 2020 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Plasma from patients with dengue-like symptoms was collected in 2013 to 2016 from the Brazilian states of Tocantins and Amapa. 781 samples testing negative for IgM against Dengue, Zika, and Chikungunya viruses and for flaviviruses, alphaviruses and enteroviruses RNA using RT-PCRs were analyzed using viral metagenomics. Viral particles-associated nucleic acids were enriched, randomly amplified, and deep sequenced in 102 mini-pools generating over 2 billion reads. Sequence data was analyzed for the presence of known and novel eukaryotic viral reads. Anelloviruses were detected in 80%, human pegivirus 1 in 19%, and parvovirus B19 in 17% of plasma pools. HIV and enteroviruses were detected in two pools each. Previously uncharacterized viral genomes were also identified, and their presence in single plasma samples confirmed by PCR. Chapparvovirus and ambidensovirus genomes, both in the Parvoviridae family, were partially characterized showing 33% and 34% identity in their NS1 sequences to their closest relative. Molecular surveillance using pre-existing plasma from febrile patients provides a readily scalable approach for the detection of novel, potentially emerging, viruses. © 2020 Fahsbender et al.

AB  - Hodgkin lymphoma is a heterogeneous condition. A proportion of cases of classic Hodgkin lymphoma are associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a herpesvirus with a worldwide distribution. In these cases, EBV is present in the tumor cells, the Hodgkin and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, and viral genes are expressed. HRS cells lack functional B-cell receptors, and the EBV proteins LMP-1 and LMP-2 appear to play a critical role in rescuing HRS cells, or their precursors, from apoptosis in germinal centers. These, and other data, support the idea that EBV plays a causal role in disease pathogenesis. EBV-associated cases are relatively more common in young children and older adults but make up a smaller proportion of cases in the young adult age-specific incidence peak. In affluent countries approximately one third of cases are EBV-associated, whereas in lower income countries, this proportion can be much higher. Risk factors for EBV-associated Hodgkin lymphoma include infectious mononucleosis, HLA class I genotype, older age, recent EBV infection in early childhood, and material deprivation. In contrast, the majority of adolescent and young adult classic Hodgkin lymphoma cases are EBV-negative. Development of this disease is associated with lack of preschool attendance; this suggests some degree of social isolation in early childhood and has led to speculation that delayed exposure to one or several common pathogens is involved in disease causation. To date, there is no evidence for direct involvement of a single virus in these cases, but it remains possible that early childhood infections play a role in disease pathogenesis. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Mosquitoes harbour a diversity of viruses and are responsible for several mosquito-borne viral diseases of humans and animals, thereby leading to major public health concerns, and significant economic losses across the globe. Viral metagenomics offers a great opportunity for bulk analysis of viral genomes retrieved directly from environmental samples. In this study, we performed a viral metagenomic analysis of five pools of mosquitoes belonging to Aedes, Anopheles and Culex species, collected from different pig farms in the vicinity of Shanghai, China, to explore the viral community carried by mosquitoes. The resulting metagenomic data revealed that viral community in the mosquitoes was highly diverse and varied in abundance among pig farms, which comprised of more than 48 viral taxonomic families, specific to vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, fungi, bacteria and protozoa. In addition, a considerable number of viral reads were related to viruses that are not classified by host. The read sequences related to animal viruses included parvoviruses, anelloviruses, circoviruses, flavivirus, rhabdovirus and seadornaviruses, which might be taken up by mosquitoes from viremic animal hosts during blood feeding. Notably, sample G1 contained the most abundant sequence related to Banna virus, which is of public health interest because it causes encephalitis in humans. Furthermore, non-classified viruses also shared considerable virus sequences in all the samples, presumably belonging to unexplored virus category. Overall, the present study provides a comprehensive knowledge of diverse viral populations carried by mosquitoes at pig farms, which is a potential source of diseases for mammals including humans and animals. These viral metagenomic data are valuable for assessment of emerging and re-emerging viral epidemics. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Human anelloviruses (Torque Teno Virus (TTV) and TTV Like Mini Virus (TLMV)) are now being reported at a high prevalence across the world, with a controversial disease-inducing potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these anellovirus in vitreous of patients with presumed infectious endophthalmitis. After informed consent, vitreous fluid from patients with endophthalmitis (n = 103) and non-infectious pathologies (n = 102) were analyzed for the presence of TTV and TLMV DNA by qPCR with the limit of quantification defined as 100 copies per reaction. Among the patients clinically diagnosed with endophthalmitis, 29 of the 40 culture proven samples (72.5%) and 42 out of 63 (66.6%) of culture-negative samples were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV. Interestingly, 51 of the 102 (50%) samples in the control group were also positive for TTV/TLMV. Comparing the clinical outcome among patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis, we observed no significant association in the final visual acuity of patients who were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV, however, these patients had significantly higher repeat antibiotic injections (p = 0.03). Further evidence is however needed to correlate TTV / TLMV with a particular pathology or group of pathologies in the eye. © 2020 Naik et al.

AB  - Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) may be the best naturally-occurring model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes. © 2019

AB  - Aims: Kawasaki disease is an acute pediatric vasculitis whose etiology remains unknown but epidemiology and clinical presentation suggest a viral etiology. We performed unbiased high-throughput-sequencing on blood of patients with Kawasaki Disease (KD). Materials and Methods: High-throughput-sequencing was performed directly on blood of children with typical KD. Sequences were aligned against a database of clinically relevant viruses. Results: Four patients were acutely infected in the blood, with respectively, poliovirus (vaccine strain), measles (vaccine strain), rhinovirus and bocavirus. Patients with poliovirus and measles had received oral polio and measles vaccines, respectively, twelve and 2 weeks prior. Conclusion: Viral signatures were identified in more than half of the patients, including some corresponding to their vaccinal history. This could suggest a temporal association with KD. © Copyright © 2019 L'Huillier, Brito, Wagner, Cordey, Zdobnov, Posfay-Barbe and Kaiser.

AB  - The human gut virome is thought to significantly impact the microbiome and human health. However, most virome analyses have been performed on a limited fraction of known viruses. Using whole-virome analysis on a published keystone inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort and an in-house ulcerative colitis dataset, we shed light on the composition of the human gut virome in IBD beyond this identifiable minority. We observe IBD-specific changes to the virome and increased numbers of temperate phage sequences in individuals with Crohn's disease. Unlike prior database-dependent methods, no changes in viral richness were observed. Among IBD subjects, the changes in virome composition reflected alterations in bacterial composition. Furthermore, incorporating both bacteriome and virome composition offered greater classification power between health and disease. This approach to analyzing whole virome across cohorts highlights significant IBD signals, which may be crucial for developing future biomarkers and therapeutics. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.
In this study, Clooney et al. describe changes in the composition and function of the human gut virome by analyzing both known and unknown viral sequences. They provide evidence that a healthy core of virulent bacteriophage is replaced by temperate bacteriophage in inflammatory bowel disease. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The cause of acute encephalitis/meningoencephalitis in pediatric patients remains often unexplained despite extensive investigations for large panel of pathogens. To explore a possible viral implication, we investigated the virome of cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 70 febrile pediatric inpatients with clinical compatible encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Using viral metagenomics, we detected and genetically characterized three novel human Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) species (TTMV-G1-3). Phylogenetically, TTMV-G1-3 clustered in three novel monophyletic lineages within genus Betatorquevirus of the Anelloviridae family. TTMV-G1-3 were highly prevalent in diseased children, but absent in the healthy cohort which may indicate an association of TTMV species with febrile illness. With 2/3 detected malaria co-infection, it remains unclear if these novel anellovirus species are causative agents or increase disease severity by interaction with malaria parasites. The presence of the viruses 28 days after initiating antimalarial and/or antibiotic treatment suggests a still active viral infection likely as effect of parasitic and/or bacterial co-infection that may have initiated a modulated immune system environment for viral replication or a defective virus clearance. This study increases the current knowledge on the genetic diversity of TTMV and strengthens that human anelloviruses can be considered as biomarkers for strong perturbations of the immune system in certain pathological conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Recurrent acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) affect a large population, yet the specific decisive factors are largely unknown. Here we study a population of 4407 children diagnosed with ARTI, comparing respiratory virome and serum cytokine profiles associated with multiple ARTIs and single ARTI during a six-year period. The relative abundance of Propionibacterium phages is significantly elevated in multiple ARTIs compared to single ARTI group. Serum levels of TIMP-1 and PDGF-BB are markedly increased in multiple ARTIs compared to single-ARTI and non-ARTI controls, making these two cytokines potential predictors for multiple ARTIs. The presence of Propionibacterium phages is associated with higher levels of TIMP-1 and PDGF-BB. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses show that the combination of TIMP-1, PDGF-BB and Propionibacterium phages could be a strong predictor for multiple ARTIs. These findings indicate that respiratory microbe homeostasis and specific cytokines are associated with the onset of multiple ARTIs over time. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Cynomolgus macaques are common across South East Asian countries including Thailand. The National Primate Research Center of Thailand, Chulalongkorn University (NPRCT-CU) captures wild-borne cynomolgus macaque for research use. Limited information is available on the enteric viruses and possible zoonotic infections into or from cynomolgus macaques. We characterized and compare the fecal virome of two populations; healthy wild-originated captive cynomolgus macaques (n = 43) reared in NPRCT-CU and healthy wild cynomolgus macaques (n = 35). Over 90% of recognized viral sequence reads amplified from feces were from bacterial viruses. Viruses from seven families of mammalian viruses were also detected (Parvoviridae, Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae, Adenoviridae, Papillomaviridae, Herpesviridae, and Caliciviridae). The genomes of a member of a new picornavirus genus we named Mafapivirus, a primate chapparvovirus, and a circular Rep-encoding single-strand (CRESS) DNA virus were also characterized. Higher abundance of CRESS DNA viruses of unknown tropism and invertebrate-tropic ambidensovirus were detected in wild versus captive macaques likely reflecting dietary differences. Short term rearing in captivity did not have a pronounced effect on the diversity of mammalian viruses of wild cynomolgus macaques. This study is the first report of the fecal virome of cynomolgus macaques, non-human primates frequently used in biomedical research and vaccination studies. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - The association of intestinal dysbiosis with the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease has been well established. Besides bacteria, microbiota comprises yeasts, archaea, protists and viruses, neglected actors in inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbiota. In the past, a great limitation in studying microbiota composition was the low sensitivity of sequencing technologies and that few computational approaches were sufficient to thoroughly analyse the whole microbiome. However, new cutting-edge technologies in nucleic acid sequencing, -omics analysis and the innovative statistics and bioinformatics pipelines made possible more sensitive and accurate metagenomics, ultimately identifying novel players in intestinal inflammation, including prokaryotic and eukaryotic viruses, that together form the gut virome. The discovery of peculiar inflammatory bowel disease-associated microbial strains will not only shed new light on inflammatory bowel disease aetiogenesis, they may also support the development of novel therapeutic strategies not merely treating symptoms, but precisely counteracting the primary cause of chronic intestinal inflammation. © Author(s) 2019.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) test is currently demanded for blood donation in China. One of the major reasons to include such a test is possible etiology of known or unknown hepatotropic viruses. However, this hypothesis has never been examined convincingly. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The study recruited 90 Chinese blood donors that were divided into three groups based on their ALT values. Serum virome from these donors was explored using a metagenomics approach with enhanced sensitivity resolved at single sequencing reads. RESULTS: Anellovirus and pegivirus C (GBV-C) were detected among these donors. None of them were found solely in donors with abnormal liver enzyme. Anellovirus was highly prevalent (93.3%) and the co-infection with multiple genera (alpha, beta, and gammatorquevirus) were more common in the donors with normal ALT values in comparison to those with elevated ALT (single/double/triple Anellovirus genera, 1/3/24 vs. 7/7/14 or 6/7/13, p = 0.009). For unmapped reads that accounted for 15 ± 14.9% of the data, similarity-based (BLASTN, BLASTP, and HMMER3) and similarity-independent (k-mer frequency) analysis identified several circular rep encoding ssDNA (CRESS-DNA) genomes. Direct PCR testing indicated these genomes were likely reagent contaminants. CONCLUSION: Viral etiology is not responsible for elevated ALT levels in Chinese blood donors. The ALT test, if not abandoned, should be adjusted for its cutoff in response to donor shortage in China. © 2019 AABB

AB  - A new member of Anelloviridae, named torque teno mini virus (TTMV)-SH, was recently identified in the serum of three Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients suggesting that TTMV-SH may be associated with this type of hematological malignancy. We investigated by metagenomic analysis the presence of TTMV-SH-related viruses in plasma samples (n = 323) collected from patients with various hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma (MM, n = 256), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL, n = 20), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 10)) and from healthy donors (n = 37). TTMV-SH-related strains were identified in 24 samples corresponding to four MM and one NHL patients. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the 24 isolates were close to the TTMV-SH strains previously identified, sharing 79.6–86.7% ORF1 nucleotide sequence identity. These results suggest that TTMV-SH-related viruses might be found in hematological diseases other than Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Due to the high genetic variability within Anelloviridae species, the association between a particular medical condition and a new genotype should be interpreted with caution. © Copyright © 2019 Bal, Oriol, Josset, Generenaz, Sarkozy, Sesques, Salles, Morfin, Lina, Becker, Reynier, Mallet, Pachot, Cheynet, Brengel-Pesce and Trouillet-Assant.

AB  - Background: Viruses and other infectious agents cause more than 15% of human cancer cases. High-throughput sequencing-based studies of virus-cancer associations have mainly focused on cancer transcriptome data. Methods: In this study, we applied a diverse selection of presequencing enrichment methods targeting all major viral groups, to characterize the viruses present in 197 samples from 18 sample types of cancerous origin. Using high-throughput sequencing, we generated 710 datasets constituting 57 billion sequencing reads. Results: Detailed in silico investigation of the viral content, including exclusion of viral artefacts, from de novo assembled contigs and individual sequencing reads yielded a map of the viruses detected. Our data reveal a virome dominated by papillomaviruses, anelloviruses, herpesviruses, and parvoviruses. More than half of the included samples contained 1 or more viruses; however, no link between specific viruses and cancer types were found. Conclusions: Our study sheds light on viral presence in cancers and provides highly relevant virome data for future reference. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

AB  - The influence of living in small remote villages on the diversity of viruses in the nasal mucosa was investigated in three Colombian villages with very different levels of geographic isolation. Metagenomic analysis was used to characterize viral nucleic acids in nasal swabs from 63 apparently healthy young children. Sequences from human virus members of the families Anelloviridae, Papillomaviridae, Picornaviridae, Herpesviridae, Polyomaviridae, Adenoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae were detected in decreasing proportions of children. The number of papillomavirus infections detected was greater among Hispanic children most exposed to outside contacts, while anellovirus infections were more common in the isolated indigenous villages. The diversity of the other human viruses detected did not differ among the villages. Closely related variants of rhinovirus A or B were identified in 2 to 4 children from each village, reflecting ongoing transmission clusters. Genomes of viruses not currently known to infect humans, including members of the families Parvoviridae, Partitiviridae, Dicistroviridae, and Iflaviridae and circular Rep-encoding single-stranded DNA (CRESS-DNA) virus, were also detected in nasal swabs, possibly reflecting environmental contamination from insect, fungal, or unknown sources. Despite the high levels of geographic and cultural isolation, the overall diversity of human viruses in the nasal passages of children was not reduced in highly isolated indigenous villages, indicating ongoing exposure to globally circulating viruses. IMPORTANCE Extreme geographic and cultural isolation can still be found in some indigenous South American villages. Such isolation May be expected to limit the introduction of otherwise common and widely distributed viruses. Very small population sizes May also result in rapid local viral extinction due to a lack of seronegative subjects to maintain transmission chains for rapidly cleared viruses. We compared the viruses in the nasal passages of young children in three villages with increasing levels of geographic isolation. We found that isolation did not reduce the overall diversity of viral infections. Multiple infections with nearly identical rhinoviruses could be detected within each village, likely reflecting recent viral introductions and transmission clusters among epidemiologically linked members of these very small communities. We conclude that, despite their geographic isolation, remote indigenous villages show evidence of ongoing exposure to globally circulating viruses. © 2019 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - The Brazilian Cerrado fauna shows very wide diversity and can be a potential viral reservoir. Therefore, the animal's susceptibility to some virus can serve as early warning signs of potential human virus diseases. Moreover, the wild animal virome of this biome is unknown. Based on this scenario, high-throughput sequencing contributes a robust tool for the identification of known and unknown virus species in this environment. In the present study, faeces samples from cerrado birds (Psittacara leucophthalmus, Amazona aestiva, and Sicalis flaveola) and mammals (Didelphis albiventris, Sapajus libidinosus, and Galictis cuja) were collected at the Veterinary Hospital, University of Brasília. Viral nucleic acid was extracted, submitted to random amplification, and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq platform. The reads were de novo assembled, and the identities of the contigs were evaluated by Blastn and tblastx searches. Most viral contigs analyzed were closely related to bacteriophages. Novel archaeal viruses of the Smacoviridae family were detected. Moreover, sequences of members of Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Caliciviridae, and Parvoviridae families were identified. Complete and nearly complete genomes of known anelloviruses, circoviruses, and parvoviruses were obtained, as well as putative novel species. We demonstrate that the metagenomics approach applied in this work was effective for identification of known and putative new viruses in faeces samples from Brazilian Cerrado fauna.

AB  - The human gut virome has an important role in human health but its dynamics remain poorly understood. Few longitudinal studies in healthy adults showed a stable temporal gut virome, with high inter-individual diversity. In contrast, the infant virome shows a high temporal intra-individual diversity. Unfortunately, these virome studies ignore an enormous amount of unknown ‘dark matter’ sequences, leading to incomplete analyses and possibly incorrect conclusions. Also, the interactions between prokaryotes and bacteriophages in the gut seem to be too complex for currently available models. Therefore, there is a huge need of larger longitudinal cohort studies focusing on both the bacterial and viral component of the microbiome to be able to describe and understand this complex ecosystem. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: New biomarkers reflecting the degree of immunosuppression in transplant recipients are needed to provide an optimal personalized balance between rejection and infection risks. Methods: For this purpose, we investigated TTV viremia dynamics in 66 kidney transplant recipients followed up for two years after transplantation, in relation to BK virus infection and graft rejection. Results: After transplantation, TTV viremia rose by ≥2 log10 copies/mL from baseline to month 3, then declined by ≥1 log10 copies/mL thereafter. Higher TTV viremia was associated with recipients of a deceased donor, a lower count of CD8+ T cells and a higher BKV viremia. Importantly, TTV loads were significantly lower in KTR who would later display graft rejection; indeed, patients with TTV viremia lower than 3.4 log10 copies/mL at transplantation or lower than 4.2 log10 copies/mL at month 1 had a higher risk of developing graft rejection in the two following years (hazard ratio (HR) at D0 = 7.30, p = 0.0007 and HR at M1 = 6.16, p = 0.001). Conclusions: TTV viremia measurement at early times post transplantation predicts graft rejection and would represent a useful tool to improve kidney transplant monitoring. © 2019 The British Infection Association

AB  - The human cervical microbiome is complex, and its role in health and disease has just begun to be elucidated. In this study, 57 cervical swab samples from 19 HIV/HPV co-infected women were analyzed for both virome and bacteriome composition. Virome analysis focused on circular DNA viruses through rolling circle amplification followed by next-generation sequencing (NGS). Data were assigned to virus families and genera, and HPV types were identified. NGS data of bacterial 16S from a subset of 24 samples were assigned to operational taxonomic units and classified according to vaginal microbiome community state types (CSTs). Four viral families were found: Papillomaviridae, Anelloviridae, Genomoviridae, and Herpesviridae. Papillomavirus reads were more abundant in women with premalignant cervical lesions, which were also strongly associated with multiple (≥3) high-risk HPV infection. Anellovirus read abundance was negatively correlated with host CD4+ T-cell counts. The bacteriome revealed the presence of CST III and CST IV, and women with ≥1% frequency of genomovirus or herpesvirus reads displayed an increased risk of carrying CST IV. By characterizing the composition of the cervical circular DNA viruses and the bacteriome of HIV/HPV co-infected women, we identified putative interactions between these two microorganism communities and their associations with patients’ clinical characteristics, notably immunodeficiency status. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Solid organ transplantation disrupts virus-host relationships, potentially resulting in viral transfer from donor to recipient, reactivation of latent viruses, and new viral infections. Viral transfer, colonization, and reactivation are typically monitored using assays for specific viruses, leaving the behavior of full viral populations (the “virome”) understudied. Here we sought to investigate the temporal behavior of viruses from donor lungs and transplant recipients comprehensively. We interrogated the bronchoalveolar lavage and blood viromes during the peritransplant period and 6-16 months posttransplant in 13 donor-recipient pairs using shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Anelloviridae, ubiquitous human commensal viruses, were the most abundant human viruses identified. Herpesviruses, parvoviruses, polyomaviruses, and bacteriophages were also detected. Anelloviridae populations were complex, with some donor organs and hosts harboring multiple contemporaneous lineages. We identified transfer of Anelloviridae lineages from donor organ to recipient serum in 4 of 7 cases that could be queried, and immigration of lineages from recipient serum into the allograft in 6 of 10 such cases. Thus, metagenomic analyses revealed that viral populations move between graft and host in both directions, showing that organ transplantation involves implantation of both the allograft and commensal viral communities. © 2018 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons

AB  - Oral flora has always presented itself in a perplexing way in terms of its biodiversity and niche. Over the years numerous techniques have been used to identify and relate these microbes to oral and systemic diseases. Recently, metagenomics has gained predominance in this field due to its potential in detecting non-cultivable flora. In the previous decade several reports have been published on identification of floral pattern, new flora and relation of such patterns to pathological processes and risk marking. But a consolidated review, linking these to actual pathology is still not published. This review provides an insight into current status of such associations. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.

AB  - The replication kinetics of nonpathogenic anelloviruses belonging to the Alphatorquevirus genus (such as torque teno virus) might reflect the overall state of posttransplant immunosuppression. We analyzed 221 kidney transplant (KT) recipients in whom plasma alphatorquevirus DNA load was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction at baseline and regularly through the first 12 posttransplant months. Study outcomes included posttransplant infection and a composite of opportunistic infection and/or de novo malignancy (immunosuppression-related adverse event [iRAE]). Alphatorquevirus DNA loads at month 1 were higher among patients who subsequently developed posttransplant infection (P =.023) or iRAE (P =.009). Likewise, those with iRAE beyond months 3 and 6 also exhibited higher peak viral loads over the preceding periods. Areas under the curve for log 10 alphatorquevirus DNAemia estimated by months 1 or 6 were significantly higher in patients experiencing study outcomes. Alphatorquevirus DNA loads above 3.15 and 4.56 log 10 copies/mL at month 1 predicted the occurrence of posttransplant infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-7.36; P =.027) and iRAE (aHR: 5.17; 95% CI: 2.01-13.33; P =.001). In conclusion, posttransplant monitoring of plasma alphatorquevirus DNA kinetics may be useful to identify KT recipients at increased risk of immunosuppression-related complications. © 2018 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons

AB  - Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), 50%-80% of which are strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), carry a high morbidity and mortality. Most clinical/epidemiological/tumor characteristics do not consistently associate with worse patient survival, so our aim was to identify if other viral genomic characteristics associated better with survival. We extracted DNA from stored paraffin-embedded PTLD tissues at our center, identified viral sequences by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS), and analyzed the data in relation to clinical outcomes. Our study population comprised 69 PTLD tissue samples collected between 1991 and 2015 from 60 subjects. Nucleotide sequences from at least one virus were detected by MSS in 86% (59/69) of the tissues (EBV in 61%, anelloviruses 52%, gammapapillomaviruses 14%, CMV 7%, and HSV in 3%). No viruses were present in higher proportion in EBV-negative PTLD (compared to EBV-positive PTLD). In univariable analysis, death within 5 years of PTLD diagnosis was associated with anellovirus (P = 0.037) and gammapapillomavirus (P = 0.036) detection by MSS, higher tissue qPCR levels of the predominant human anellovirus species torque teno virus (TTV; P = 0.016), T cell type PTLD, liver, brain or bone marrow location. In multivariable analyses, T cell PTLD (P = 0.006) and TTV PCR level (P = 0.012) remained significant. In EBV-positive PTLD, EBNA-LP, EBNA1 and EBNA3C had significantly higher levels of nonsynonymous gene variants compared to the other EBV genes. Multiple viruses are detectable in PTLD tissues by MSS. Anellovirus positivity, not EBV positivity,was associated with worse patient survival in our series. Confirmation and extension of this work in larger multicenter studies is desirable. © 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Malabsorption syndrome (MAS) is an economically important disease of young, commercially reared broilers, characterized by growth retardation, defective feather development and diarrheic faeces. Several viruses have been tentatively associated to such syndrome. Here, in order to examine potential associations between enteric viruses and MAS, the faecal viromes of 70 stool samples collected from diseased (n = 35) and healthy (n = 35) chickens from seven flocks were characterized and compared. Following high-throughput sequencing, a total of 8,347,319 paired end reads, with an average of 231 nt, were generated. Through analysis of de novo assembled contigs, 144 contigs > 1000 nt were identified with hits to eukaryotic viral sequences, as determined by GenBank database. A number of known and unknown representatives of Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae and Reoviridae, as well as novel uncharacterized CRESS-DNA viruses, were identified. However, the distribution of sequence reads of viral genomes identified in diseased or healthy birds revealed no statistically significant differences. These findings indicate no association between the occurrence of MAS and enteric viruses. The viral genomes reported in the present study, including a variety of novel viruses, seem part of the normal intestinal microbiota of chickens. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri) has been proposed as an alternative laboratory animal to primates in biomedical research in recent years. However, characteristics of the tree shrew gut virome remain unclear. In this study, the metagenomic analysis method was used to identify the features of gut virome from fecal samples of this animal. Results showed that 5.80% of sequence reads in the libraries exhibited significant similarity to sequences deposited in the viral reference database (NCBI non-redundant nucleotide databases, viral protein databases and ACLAME database), and these reads were further classified into three major orders: Caudovirales (58.0%), Picornavirales (16.0%), and Herpesvirales (6.0%). Siphoviridae (46.0%), Myoviridae (45.0%), and Podoviridae (8.0%) comprised most Caudovirales. Picornaviridae (99.9%) and Herpesviridae (99.0%) were the primary families of Picornavirales and Herpesvirales, respectively. According to the host types and nucleic acid classifications, all of the related viruses in this study were divided into bacterial phage (61.83%), animal-specific virus (34.50%), plant-specific virus (0.09%), insect-specific virus (0.08%) and other viruses (3.50%). The dsDNA virus accounted for 51.13% of the total, followed by ssRNA (33.51%) and ssDNA virus (15.36%). This study provides an initial understanding of the community structure of the gut virome of tree shrew and a baseline for future tree shrew virus investigation. © 2019 Chen et al.

AB  - Objectives: Because commensal viruses are defined by the immunologic tolerance afforded to them, any immunomodulation, such as is received during haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation, may shift the demarcation between innocuous viral resident and disease-causing pathogen. Methods: We analysed by deep-sequencing the plasma virome of 40 allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation patients 1 month after transplantation. Because human pegivirus (HPgV) was highly prevalent, we performed a 1-year screening of 122 plasma samples by specific real-time reverse transcription PCR assay. We used the log-rank test and the Gray test to assess association with outcomes, and the Mann-Whitney test and multivariable linear regression model to assess association with T-cell reconstitution. Results: Polyomaviruses (PyV) (20/40 patients), anelloviruses (16/40), pegiviruses (14/40) and herpesviruses (14/40) were most frequently identified, including ten cytomegalovirus; three Epstein-Barr virus; two herpes simplex virus type 1; one human herpesvirus 6b and one human herpesvirus 7; 18 Merkel cell–PyV; two BK-PyV; three PyV-6; and one JC-PyV. Papillomavirus and adenovirus were identified in 11 and two patients, respectively. The HPgV specific real-time reverse transcription PCR screening identified 51 of 122 positive samples, high virus loads and persistent infections up to 1 year after transplantation. Comparison between patients with or without HPgV infection at time of transplantation did not reveal a significant difference in infections, engraftment, survival, graft vs. host disease, relapse or immune reconstitution. Conclusions: The blood virome after allogeneic haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation includes several DNA viruses, notably herpesviruses and PyV. Among RNA viruses, HPgV is highly prevalent and persists for several months, and it thus may deserve special attention in further research on immune reconstitution. © 2018 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases

AB  - Background: Stool consistency is an important diagnostic criterion in both research and clinical medicine and is often used to define diarrheal disease. Methods: We examine the pediatric enteric virome across stool consistencies to evaluate differences in richness and community composition using fecal samples collected from children aged 0 to 5 years participating in a clinical trial in the Amhara region of Ethiopia. The consistency of each sample was graded according to the modified Bristol Stool Form Scale for children (mBSFS-C) before a portion of stool was preserved for viral metagenomic analysis. Stool samples were grouped into 29 pools according to stool consistency type. Differential abundance was determined using negative-binomial modeling. Results: Of 446 censused children who were eligible to participate, 317 presented for the study visit examination and 269 provided stool samples. The median age of children with stool samples was 36 months. Species richness was highest in watery-consistency stool and decreased as stool consistency became firmer (Spearman’s r = − 0.45, p = 0.013). The greatest differential abundance comparing loose or watery to formed stool was for norovirus GII (7.64, 95% CI 5.8, 9.5) followed by aichivirus A (5.93, 95% CI 4.0, 7.89) and adeno-associated virus 2 (5.81, 95%CI 3.9, 7.7). Conclusions: In conclusion, we documented a difference in pediatric enteric viromes according to mBSFS-C stool consistency category, both in species richness and composition. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Faecal microbiota transplant (FMT) has now been established into clinical guidelines for the treatment of recurrent and refractory Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). Its therapeutic application in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is currently at an early stage. To date, there have been four randomized controlled trials for FMT in IBD and a multitude of observational studies. However, significant gaps in our knowledge regarding optimum methods for FMT preparation, technical aspects and logistics of its administration, as well as mechanistic underpinnings, still remain. In this article, we aim to highlight these gaps by reviewing evidence and making key recommendations on the direction of future studies in this field. In addition, we provide an overview of the current evidence of potential mechanisms of FMT in treating IBD. © The Author(s), 2019.

AB  - Despite the advanced PCR-based assays available, a fraction of the pediatric respiratory infections remain unexplained every epidemic season, and there is a perception that novel viruses might be present in these specimens. We systematically collected samples from a prospective cohort of pediatric patients with respiratory infections, that returned negative results by validated molecular RT–PCR assays, and studied them with a target-independent, high-throughput sequencing-based approach. We also included a matched cohort of children with no symptoms of respiratory infection, as a contrast study population. More than fifty percent of the specimens from the group of patients with unexplained respiratory infections were resolved. However, the higher rate of detection was not due to the presence of novel viruses, but to the identification of well-known viral respiratory pathogens. Our results show that already known viral pathogens are responsible for the majority of cases that remain unexplained after the epidemic season. High-throughput sequencing approaches that use pathogen-specific probes are easier to standardize because they ensure reproducible library enrichment and sequencing. In consequence, these techniques might be desirable from a regulatory standpoint for diagnostic laboratories seeking to benefit from the many advantages of these sequencing technologies. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - G-quadruplexes are non-canonical nucleic-acid structures that control transcription, replication, and recombination in organisms. G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of potential quadruplex-forming sequences (PQS) in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that occurrence and location of PQSs are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the PQS classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all PQS present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each PQS in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of PQS abundance. This information is accessible from a database to allow the easy navigation of the results: http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php?id=g4virus. The availability of these data will greatly expedite research on G-quadruplex in viruses, with the possibility to accelerate finding therapeutic opportunities to numerous and some fearsome human diseases. © 2018 Lavezzo et al. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/.

AB  - Human microbiome studies have revealed the intricate interplay of host immunity and bacterial communities to achieve homeostatic balance. Healthy skin microbial communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation1–3, mainly bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited. Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding of microbial–host interactions. Primary immunodeficient patients manifest with various viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, including skin infections4. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility5. DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues such as skin6. Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity compared with healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - Worldwide Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV, genus Iotatorquevirus) species have been regarded as possible agents associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease. Iotatorquevirus species possess high genomic variability, suggesting that diverse genotypes are widely geographically distributed. In this study, we validated the genomic variability of Iotaroquevirus species in pigs with postweaned multisystemic wasting syndrome. Genomic DNA from nine TTSuV1a-positive tissues and 15 TTSuV1b-positive tissues was used to amplify the complete ORF2 of each species by nested PCR to perform a molecular characterization. It was found that Mexican TTSuV1a sequences belong to genotype B, sharing phylogenetic origin, high nucleic acid and amino acid sequence similarity and dominant epitope conformation with commercially linked countries, such as the United States, Canada and China, whereas the Mexican TTSuV1b sequences belong to genotype A, being more divergent among each other and displaying low nucleotide identity with worldwide genotype A sequences. In both Iotatorquevirus species, a PTPase-like signature motif was identified in the predicted amino acid sequence, being more conserved for Mexican TTSuV1b sequences than for Mexican TTSuV1a sequences, in which several substitutions were observed. These changes may influence the conformation of dominant epitopes as different arrays were determined among TTSuV1a genotypes. ORF2 variability may account for pathogenic differences by modifying viral replication and immune response, as depicted for human TTV. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of the anelloviruses, the major component of the human virome, for the prediction of post-transplant complications such as severe infections. Due to an important diversity, the comprehensive characterization of this viral family over time has been poorly studied. To overcome this challenge, we used a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach with the aim of determining the individual anellovirus profile of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) patients. We conducted a prospective pilot study on a homogeneous patient cohort regarding the chemotherapy regimens that included 10 ASCT recipients. A validated viral mNGS workflow was used on 108 plasma samples collected at 11 time points from diagnosis to 90 days post-transplantation. A complex interindividual variability in terms of abundance and composition was noticed. In particular, a strong sex effect was found and confirmed using quantitative PCR targeting torque teno virus, the most abundant anellovirus. Interestingly, an important turnover in the anellovirus composition was observed during the course of the disease revealing a strong intra-individual variability. Although more studies are needed to better understand anellovirus dynamics, these findings are of prime importance for their future use as biomarkers of immune competence. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Studies of human airway virome are relatively recent and still very limited. Culture-independent microbial techniques showed growing evidence of numerous viral communities in the respiratory microbial ecosystem. The significance of different acute respiratory viruses is already known in the pathogenesis of chronic conditions, such as asthma, cystic fibrosis (CF), or chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), and their exacerbations. Viral pathogens, such as influenza, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, or rhinovirus, have been associated with impaired immune response, acute exacerbations, and decrease in lung function in chronic lung diseases. However, more data have attributed a role to Herpes family viruses or the newly identified Anelloviridae family of viruses in chronic diseases, such as asthma, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), or CF. Impaired antiviral immunity, bacterial colonization, or used medication, such as glucocorticoids or antibiotics, contribute to the imbalance of airway microbiome and may shape the local viral ecosystem. A specific part of virome, bacteriophages, frames lung microbial communities through direct contact with its host, the specific bacteria known as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or their biofilm formation. Moreover, antibiotic resistance is induced through phages via horizontal transfer and leads to more severe exacerbations of chronic airway conditions. Morbidity and mortality of asthma, COPD, CF, and IPF remains high, despite an increased understanding and knowledge about the impact of respiratory virome in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Thus, more studies focus on new prophylactic methods or therapeutic agents directed toward viral⁻host interaction, microbial metabolic function, or lung microbial composition rearrangement.

AB  - Viral diversity associated with Antarctic wildlife remains poorly studied. Nonetheless, over the past 5 years, there has been a concerted effort using viral metagenomics approaches to identify and characterize viruses associated with Antarctic pinniped and avian species. Here we used a viral metagenomics approach to identify circular DNA viruses in buccal swab samples from Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on Livingston Island, Antarctica during the 2016/2017 field season. We identified two new lineages of anelloviruses, torque teno Arctocephalus gazella virus (TTAgV)-1 (2083 nts) and -2 (2127–2143 nts), which are most closely related to and cluster with a previously identified anellovirus associated with California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) sharing ~ 60% genome-wide pairwise identity. The ORF1 of TTAgVs share 26–41% amino acid similarity to the ORF1 of other previously identified pinniped-associated anelloviruses. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background: Torquetenovirus (TTV) belongs to Anelloviridae family, infects nearly all people indefinitely without causing overt disease establishing a fine and successful interaction with the host. Increasing evidence have shown some human viruses exploit extracellular vesicles thereby helping viral persistence in the host. Here, the presence of TTV in extracellular vesicles circulating in human plasma was investigated. Methods: TTV DNA was quantified in plasma-derived exosomes from 122 samples collected from 97 diseased patients and 25 healthy donors. Exosomes enriched vesicles (EEVs) were extracted from plasma and characterized by Nanoparticle tracking analysis, by western blot for presence of tetraspanin CD63, CD81 and annexin II protein and, finally, by electron microscopy (EM). Presence and quantitation of TTV DNA were assessed with an universal single step real-time TaqMan PCR assay. Results: Preliminary investigation showed that the human plasma extracted extracellular vesicles exhibited a main size of 70 nm, had concentration of 2.5 × 109/ml, and scored positive for tetraspanin CD63, CD81 and annexin II, typical characteristic of the exosomes vesicles. EEVs extracted from pooled plasma with TTV DNA viremia of 9.7 × 104 copies/ml showed to contain 6.3 × 102 TTV copies/ml, corresponding to 0.65% of total viral load. Important, TTV yield changed significantly following freezing/thawing, detergents and DNAse treatment of plasma before EEVs extraction. EEVs purified by sucrose-density gradient centrifugation and analysis of gradient fraction positive for exosomes marker CD63 harbored 102 TTV copies/ml. Moreover, EM evidenced the presence of TTV-like particles in EEVs. Successive investigation of plasma EEVs from 122 subjects (37 HIV-positive, 20 HCV infected, 20 HBV infected, 20 kidney transplant recipients, and 25 healthy) reported TTV DNA detection in 42 (34%) of the viremic samples (37 were from diseased patients and 5 from healthy people) at a mean level of 4.8 × 103 copies/ml. The examination of EEVs selected samples reported the presence of TTV genogroup 1, 3, 4 and 5, with genogroup 3 highly observed. Conclusions: Collectively, although these observations should be confirmed by further studies, circulation of TTV particles in EEVs opens new avenues and mechanistic insights on the molecular strategies adopted by anelloviruses to persist in the host. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - The members of the family Anelloviridae are small and single-stranded DNA viruses with marked diversity in sequence and length, which ubiquitously infect many vertebrates, including mammals, birds and reptiles. The anelloviruses isolated from mammals are currently classified into 11 assigned and four proposed genera; some anelloviruses remain unassigned. The present study was conducted to identify anelloviruses in wild-caught masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) in Japan using a rolling-circle amplification method. Thirteen novel anellovirus strains were identified from 8 of 10 masked palm civets and their entire genomic sequences (2039–2535 nucleotides) were determined; they were classifiable into four distinct clades. Comparative analyses of all reported anelloviruses for which the entire or near-entire genomic sequences have been determined, including the 13 strains obtained in the present study, revealed that anelloviruses can provisionally be classified into 20 clades, which may correspond to 20 genera (including 11 assigned and four proposed genera) by a >70% amino acid sequence difference in open reading frame 1 (ORF1). This study suggested that novel anelloviruses of marked diversity are circulating in animals worldwide, and that the rolling-circle amplification method would be useful for identifying novel anelloviruses and other viruses with a circular DNA genome. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background The enteric viruses shed by different populations can be influenced by multiple factors including access to clean drinking water. We describe here the eukaryotic viral genomes in the feces of Ethiopian children participating in a clean water intervention trial. Methodology/principal findings Fecal samples from 269 children with a mean age of 2.7 years were collected from 14 villages in the Amhara region of Ethiopia, half of which received a new hand-dug water well. Feces from these villages were then analyzed in 29 sample pools using viral metagenomics. A total of 127 different viruses belonging to 3 RNA and 3 DNA viral families were detected. Picornaviridae family sequence reads were the most commonly found, originating from 14 enterovirus and 6 parechovirus genotypes plus multiple members of four other picornavirus genera (cosaviruses, saliviruses, kobuviruses, and hepatoviruses). Picornaviruses with nearly identical capsid VP1 were detected in different pools reflecting recent spread of these viral strains. Next in read frequencies and positive pools were sequences from the Caliciviridae family including noroviruses GI and GII and sapoviruses. DNA viruses from multiple genera of the Parvoviridae family were detected (bocaviruses 1–4, bufavirus 3, and depen-doparvoviruses), together with four species of adenoviruses and common anelloviruses shedding. RNA in the order Picornavirales and CRESS-DNA viral genomes, possibly originating from intestinal parasites or dietary sources, were also characterized. No significant difference was observed between the number of mammalian viruses shed from children from villages with and without a new water well. Conclusions We describe an approach to estimate the efficacy of potentially virus transmission-reducing interventions and the first complete (DNA and RNA viruses) description of the enteric viromes of East African children. A wide diversity of human enteric viruses was found in both intervention and control groups. Mammalian enteric virome diversity was not reduced in children from villages with a new water well. This population-based sampling also provides a baseline of the enteric viruses present in Northern Ethiopia against which to compare future viromes. © 2018 Altan et al.

AB  - Porcine respiratory disease is a multifactorial disease that can be influenced by a number of different microorganisms, as well as by non-infectious factors such as the management and environment of the animals. It is generally believed that the interaction between different infectious agents plays an important role in regard to respiratory diseases. Therefore, we used high-throughput sequencing combined with viral metagenomics to characterise the viral community of tonsil samples from pigs coming from a conventional herd with lesions in the respiratory tract at slaughter. In parallel, samples from specific pathogen-free pigs were also analysed. This study showed a variable co-infection rate in the different pigs. The differences were not seen at the group level but in individual pigs. Some viruses such as adenoviruses and certain picornaviruses could be found in most pigs, while others such as different parvoviruses and anelloviruses were only identified in a few pigs. In addition, the complete coding region of porcine parvovirus 7 was obtained, as were the complete genomes of two teschoviruses. The results from this study will aid in elucidating which viruses are circulating in both healthy pigs and in pigs associated with respiratory illness. This knowledge is needed for future investigations into the role of viral-viral interactions in relation to disease development. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Background: Human anelloviruses (TTV, TTMDV and TTMV) are at high prevalence all across the globe, having also a controversial disease-inducing potential. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of anelloviral DNA in the Romanian human population and to investigate the association of infections with common pathologies in Romanian population. Methods: After informed consent, blood samples were collected from 2000 subjects represented by: clinically healthy individuals (n = 701) and a group of patients with pathologies linked to low grade inflammation or alteration of carbohydrate metabolism (n = 1299). All samples were analysed for the presence of TTV, TTMDV and TTMV DNA by hemi-nested PCR. Results: The prevalence of TTV, TTMDV and TTMV in the studied population was 68.2, 54.4%, respectively 40.1%, lower than the recent reports from other geographic regions. The three viral species were significantly more frequent in the group of patients compared to the healthy subjects and were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of anelloviral DNA was also associated with medical procedures (e.g. haemodialysis/transfusions, surgical procedures) and previous hepatitis A virus infection. Lifestyle choices related to alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity and living environment were not associated with differences in distribution of the three viruses. Conclusion: Further evidence is needed to establish a correlation between infection with human anelloviruses and a pathology or group of pathologies. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim: To characterize the respiratory virome in moderate/severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients using metagenomics, with healthy subjects as the reference. Patients & Methods: Sputum COPD samples were collected during stability and exacerbations with negative usual-care microbiologic analysis. Results: Eukaryotic viruses from the Anelloviridae, Herpesviridae and Retroviridae families and phages from the Shiphoviridae family were commonly found in COPD, and the respiratory virome in stability and noninfectious exacerbations showed a substantial similarity. DNA viruses with the highest relative abundance in COPD are Anelloviridae. Conclusion: These results support a colonizing role for eukaryotic viruses in COPD and highlight the importance of analyzing both DNA and RNA viruses when focusing on the respiratory virome. © 2018 2018 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Infections have been suggested to be involved in Multiple Sclerosis (MS). We used metagenomic sequencing to detect both known and yet unknown microorganisms in 2 nested case control studies of MS. Two different cohorts were followed for MS using registry linkages. Serum samples taken before diagnosis as well as samples from matched control subjects were selected. In cohort1 with 75 cases and 75 controls, most viral reads were Anelloviridae-related and >95% detected among the cases. Among samples taken up to 2 years before MS diagnosis, Anellovirus species TTMV1, TTMV6 and TTV27 were significantly more common among cases. In cohort2, 93 cases and 93 controls were tested under the pre-specified hypothesis that the same association would be found. Although most viral reads were again related to Anelloviridae, no significant case-control differences were seen. We conclude that the Anelloviridae-MS association may be due to multiple hypothesis testing, but other explanations are possible. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Gyroviruses are small, single stranded DNA viruses in the family Anelloviridae. In chickens, the type virus (chicken anemia virus; CAV) causes epidemic disease in poultry flocks worldwide. In 2007 and 2008, young crested screamers (Chauna torquata) at a zoo in Wisconsin, USA, died of neurologic disease with clinical and pathological features resembling CAV infection. Conventional diagnostics were negative, but molecular analyses revealed coinfection of an affected bird with three variants of a novel Gyrovirus lineage, GyV10. Analysis of ten additional screamers from this and another zoo revealed infection in all but one bird, with co-infections and persistent infections common. The association between GyV10 (“screamer anemia virus,” provisionally) and the disease remains unproven, but certain immunological and neurologic features of the syndrome would expand the known pathologic consequences of Gyrovirus infection. To control the virus, autogenous vaccines, environmental decontamination, and management strategies to limit vertical and horizontal transmission might prove effective. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Routine large-scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is getting closer to clinical reality owing to several state-of-the-art technologies, especially the ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, using pig organs in humans poses risks including unwanted cross-species transfer of viruses and adaption of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome studies in mammals. Specifically, the ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new hosts and cross-species barriers. Pig-associated ssDNA viruses include torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV) in the Anelloviridae family, porcine parvoviruses (PPV), and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV) both in the family of Parvoviridae, and porcine circoviruses (PCV) in the Circoviridae family, some of which have been confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig-associated ssDNA viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Aleutian mink disease virus is the type species in the genus Amdoparvovirus, and in mink and other Mustelidae can cause either subclinical disease or fatal chronic immune stimulation and immune complex disease. The authors describe a novel amdoparvovirus in the endangered red panda (Ailurus fulgens), discovered using viral metagenomics. The authors analyzed the prevalence, tissue distribution, and disease association by PCR, in situ hybridization, electron microscopy, and histology in a group of 6 red pandas from a single zoological collection. The study incorporates a fecal shedding survey and analysis of tissues from 4 necropsied animals over a 12-year span. The tentatively named red panda amdoparvovirus (RpAPV) was detected in the feces and/or tissues of all animals tested. At necropsy of 1 geriatric animal, infection was associated with pyogranulomatous peritonitis, pancreatitis, and myocarditis. Other animals had detectable low-level viral nucleic acid in lymph nodes and both oral and intestinal epithelium at the time of necropsy. Full-length genome sequences of RpAPV strains from 2 animals had 12% sequence divergence, demonstrating genetic diversity even among in-contact animals. RpAPV is a persistent infection in this cohort of red pandas, and has variable clinical expression. © 2018, The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The human virome plays an important role for the clinical outcome of lung transplant recipients (LTRs). While pathogenic viruses may cause severe infections, non-pathogenic viruses may serve as potential markers for the level of immunosuppression. However, neither the complexity of the virome in different compartments nor the dynamics of the virus populations posttransplantation are yet understood. Therefore, in this study the virome was analyzed by metagenomic sequencing in simultaneously withdrawn bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and plasma samples of 15 LTRs. In seven patients, also follow-up samples were investigated for abundance and dynamics of virus populations posttransplantation. Five eukaryotic and two prokaryotic virus families were identified in BAL, and nine eukaryotic and two prokaryotic families in plasma. Anelloviruses were the most abundant in both compartments, followed by Herpes- and Coronaviruses. Virus abundance was significantly higher in LTRs than in healthy controls (Kruskal-Wallis test, p<0.001). Up to 48 different anellovirus strains were identified within a single LTR. Analyses in the follow-up patients revealed for the first time a highly complex and unique dynamics of individual anellovirus strains in the posttransplantation period. The abundance of anelloviruses in plasma was inversely correlated with that of other eukaryotic viruses (Pearson correlation coefficient r = −0.605; p<0.05). A broad spectrum of virus strains co-exists in BAL and plasma of LTRs. Especially for the anelloviruses, a high degree of co-infections and a highly individual and complex dynamics after transplantation was observed. The biological impact of these findings and their relation to clinical variables remain to be elucidated by future analyses. © 2018 Segura-Wang et al.

AB  - The management of hand-foot-and-mouth disease(HFMD) epidemic is difficult due to the frequent emergence of non-EV71 and non-CVA16 enteroviruses and some cases testing negative for HFMD-associated causative agents. To clarify the virus spectrum of mild and severe HFMD, a comprehensive virome analysis of 238 samples was performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS). The data revealed total thirteen mammalian- and plant- virus families and diverse viral populations including enteroviruses, common respiratory viruses, diarrhea-related viruses, plant viruses and anelloviruses. A total of 18 viruses from 7 virus families were identified in severe cases, versus 37 viruses from 12 virus families in mild cases. Moreover, complicated mixed-infections of enteroviruses with common respiratory viruses were mainly found in severe cases(P = 0.013), while diarrhea-related viruses were mainly found in mild cases(P < 0.001). This study provides the preliminary understanding of viromes both in mild and severe cases, which may benefit the detection of etiologic agents and prevention of HFMD. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The microbiome, a thriving and complex microbial community colonizing the human body, has a broad impact on human health. Colonization is a continuous process that starts very early in life and occurs thanks to shrewd strategies microbes have evolved to tackle a convoluted array of anatomical, physiological, and functional barriers of the human body. Cumulative evidence shows that viruses are part of the microbiome. This part, called virome, has a dynamic composition that reflects what we eat, how and where we live, what we do, our genetic background, and other unpredictable variables. Thus, the virome plays a chief role in shaping innate and adaptive host immune defenses. Imbalance of normal microbial flora is thought to trigger or exacerbate many acute and chronic disorders. A compelling example can be found in the respiratory apparatus, where early-life viral infections are major determinants for the development of allergic diseases, like asthma, and other non-transmissible diseases. In this review, we focus on the virome and, particularly, on Anelloviridae, a recently discovered virus family. Anelloviruses are major components of the virome, present in most, if not all, human beings, where they are acquired early in life and replicate persistently without causing apparent disease. We will discuss how modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems by Anelloviruses can influence the development of respiratory diseases in childhood and provide evidence for the use of Anelloviruses as useful and practical molecular markers to monitor inflammatory processes and immune system competence. © 2018 Freer, Maggi, Pifferi, Di Cicco, Peroni and Pistello.

AB  - Vast viruses are thought to be associated with mosquitoes. Anopheles sinensis, Armigeres subalbatus, Culex quinquefasciatus, and Culex tritaeniorhynchus are very common mosquito species in China, and whether the virome structure in each species is species-specific has not been evaluated. In this study, a total of 2222 mosquitoes were collected from the same geographic location, and RNAs were sequenced using the Illumina Miseq platform. After querying to the Refseq database, a total of 3,435,781, 2,223,509, 5,727,523, and 6,387,867 paired-end reads were classified under viral sequences from An. sinensis, Ar. subalbatus, Cx. quinquefasciatus, and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus, respectively, with the highest prevalence of virus-associated reads being observed in Cx. quinquefasciatus. The metagenomic comparison analysis showed that the virus-related reads were distributed across 26 virus families, together with an unclassified group of viruses. Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Genomoviridae, Iridoviridae, Mesoniviridae, Microviridae, Myoviridae, Parvoviridae, Phenuiviridae, and Podoviridae were the top ten significantly different viral families among the four species. Further analysis reveals that the virome is species-specific in four mosquito samples, and several viral sequences which maybe belong to novel viruses are discovered for the first time in those mosquitoes. This investigation provides a basis for a comprehensive knowledge on the mosquito virome status in China. © 2018, Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - Ticks are blood-feeding arachnids that are vectors of several important human and animal pathogens. Little is known about single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that are associated with these ectoparasites. As part of a pilot study to identify ssDNA viruses present in ticks, female American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) and blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) were collected in eastern Pennsylvania (USA), and the extracted viral DNA was analyzed using viral metagenomics approaches. Three genomoviruses were recovered from pooled samples of D. variabilis (n = 2) and I. scapularis (n = 1): two belonging to the genus Gemycircularvirus, sharing < 63% pairwise identity with other members within the genus; and the third belonging to the genus Gemykolovirus, sharing < 70% pairwise identity to other gemykoloviruses. Furthermore, a genome of an anellovirus belonging to the sharing 62–65% nucleotide identity with torque teno canis viruses (genus Thetatorquevirus) was also recovered from a D. variabilis pooled sample. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Serum samples collected from 88 Peruvians with unexplained fever were analyzed for viral sequences using metagenomics. Nucleic acids of anelloviruses, pegivirus A (GBV-C), HIV, Dengue virus, and Oropouche virus were detected. We also characterized from two sera the RNA genomes of new species of partitivirus and dicistrovirus belonging to viral families known to infect fungi or arthropod, respectively. Genomic DNA of a putative fungal cellular host could be PCR amplified from the partitivirus-containing serum sample. The detection in human serum of nucleic acids from viral families not known to infect vertebrates may indicate contamination during sample collection and aliquoting or human infection by their presumed cellular host, here a fungus. The role, if any, of the non-vertebrate infecting viruses detected in serum in inducing fever is unknown. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Anelloviruses are DNA viruses ubiquitously present in human blood. Due to their elevated levels in immunosuppressed patients, anellovirus levels have been proposed as a marker of immune status. We hypothesized that low anellovirus levels, reflecting relative immunocompetence, would be associated with adverse outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation. We assayed blood samples from 57 patients in a multicenter study for alpha- and betatorquevirus, two anellovirus genera. The primary short-term outcome of interest was acute rejection, and longer-term outcomes were analyzed individually and as “composite” (death, chronic rejection, or retransplant within 2 years). Patients with low alphatorquevirus levels at 2 weeks post-transplantation were more likely to develop acute rejection within 3 months after transplant (P =.013). Low betatorquevirus levels at 6 weeks and 6 months after transplant were associated with death (P =.047) and the composite outcome (P =.017), respectively. There was an association between low anellovirus levels and adverse outcomes in pediatric lung transplantation. Alphatorquevirus levels were associated with short-term outcomes (ie, acute rejection), while betatorquevirus levels were associated with longer-term outcomes (ie, death, or composite outcome within 2 years). These observations suggest that anelloviruses may serve as useful biomarkers of immune status and predictors of adverse outcomes. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The Anelloviridae comprises single-stranded DNA viruses currently grouped in sixty-eight species classified in twelve genera. They have been found in many vertebrate hosts including primates. In this study, we describe the application of the high-throughput sequencing to examine the frequency and diversity of anelloviruses in rodents, bats and opossums captured in São Paulo State, Brazil. We report a total of twenty-six anelloviruses with sixteen nearly complete genomes and ten partial genomes, which include eleven potential novel species identified in rodents (Cricetidae), bats (Molossidae and Phyllostomidae), and opossums (Didelphidae). We also propose the inclusion of two potential new genera within the Anelloviridae family, provisionally named Omegatorquevirus and Sigmatorquevirus, including six and three novel species of anelloviruses, respectively. In summary, this study expands the diversity and the host range of the known anelloviruses. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Rationale: The etiology of sarcoidosis is unknown, but microbial agents are suspected as triggers. Objectives: We sought to identify bacterial, fungal, or viral lineages in specimens from patients with sarcoidosis enriched relative to control subjects using metagenomic DNA sequencing. Because DNA from environmental contamination contributes disproportionately to samples with low authentic microbial content, we developed improved methods for filtering environmental contamination. Methods: We analyzed specimens from subjects with sarcoidosis (n = 93), control subjects without sarcoidosis (n = 72), and various environmental controls (n = 150). Sarcoidosis specimens consisted of two independent sets of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded lymph node biopsies, BAL, Kveim reagent, and fresh granulomatous spleen from a patient with sarcoidosis. All specimens were analyzed by bacterial 16S and fungal internal transcribed spacer ribosomal RNA gene sequencing. In addition, BAL was analyzed by shotgun sequencing of fractions enriched for viral particles, and Kveim and spleen were subjected to whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: In one tissue set, fungi in the Cladosporiaceae family were enriched in sarcoidosis compared with nonsarcoidosis tissues; in the other tissue set, we detected enrichment of several bacterial lineages in sarcoidosis but not Cladosporiaceae. BAL showed limited enrichment of Aspergillus fungi. Several microbial lineages were detected in Kveim and spleen, including Cladosporium. No microbial lineage was enriched in more than one sample type after correction for multiple comparisons. Conclusions: Metagenomic sequencing revealed enrichment of microbes in single types of sarcoidosis samples but limited concordance across sample types. Statistical analysis accounting for environmental contamination was essential to avoiding false positives. Copyright © 2018 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - The Antarctic, sub-Antarctic islands and surrounding sea-ice provide a unique environment for the existence of organisms. Nonetheless, birds and seals of a variety of species inhabit them, particularly during their breeding seasons. Early research on Antarctic wildlife health, using serology-based assays, showed exposure to viruses in the families Birnaviridae, Flaviviridae, Herpesviridae, Orthomyxoviridae and Paramyxoviridae circulating in seals (Phocidae), penguins (Spheniscidae), petrels (Procellariidae) and skuas (Stercorariidae). It is only during the last decade or so that polymerase chain reaction-based assays have been used to characterize viruses associated with Antarctic animals. Furthermore, it is only during the last five years that full/whole genomes of viruses (adenoviruses, anelloviruses, orthomyxoviruses, a papillomavirus, paramyoviruses, polyomaviruses and a togavirus) have been sequenced using Sanger sequencing or high throughput sequencing (HTS) approaches. This review summaries the knowledge of animal Antarctic virology and discusses potential future directions with the advent of HTS in virus discovery and ecology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - When human samples are sequenced, many assembled contigs are “unknown”, as conventional alignments find no similarity to known sequences. Hidden Markov models (HMM) exploit the positions of specific nucleotides in protein-encoding codons in various microbes. The algorithm HMMER3 implements HMM using a reference set of sequences encoding viral proteins, “vFam”. We used HMMER3 analysis of “unknown” human sample-derived sequences and identified 510 contigs distantly related to viruses (Anelloviridae (n = 1), Baculoviridae (n = 34), Circoviridae (n = 35), Caulimoviridae (n = 3), Closteroviridae (n = 5), Geminiviridae (n = 21), Herpesviridae (n = 10), Iridoviridae (n = 12), Marseillevirus (n = 26), Mimiviridae (n = 80), Phycodnaviridae (n = 165), Poxviridae (n = 23), Retroviridae (n = 6) and 89 contigs related to described viruses not yet assigned to any taxonomic family). In summary, we find that analysis using the HMMER3 algorithm and the “vFam” database greatly extended the detection of viruses in biospecimens from humans. © 2018 Bzhalava et al.

AB  - Chicken anemia virus (CAV) is a small, single-stranded DNA virus of Anelloviridae family. Its genome segments encode three proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. This study identified an interaction between VP2 and VP3 and mapped the interaction domains. Through the yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) system, VP2 was found to interact with VP3. The presence of the VP2–VP3 complex in CAV-infected chicken cells was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Confocal microscopy showed that VP2 and VP3 were expressed in the cytoplasm in cotransfected Vero cells. In the Y2H system, the interaction domains were identified as being within the N-terminal aa 1–30 and C-terminal aa 17–60 for VP2 and the N-terminal aa 46–60 and C-terminal aa 1–7 for VP3. This study showed the interaction between VP2 and VP3 of CAV and identified multiple independent interactive domains within the two proteins. This provides novel information for investigating the biological functions of these proteins. © 2017

AB  - In the present study, 50 nasopharyngeal swabs from children with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) but negative for 18 common respiratory viruses, as measured by the Luminex xTAG Respiratory Viral Panel Assay, were subjected to multiplex metagenomic analyses using a next-generation sequencing platform. Taxonomic analysis showed that all sequence reads could be assigned to a specific species. An average of 95.13% were assigned to the Bacteria kingdom, whereas, only 0.72% were potentially virus derived. This snapshot of the respiratory tract virome revealed most viral reads to be respiratory tract related, classified into four known virus families: Paramyxoviridae, Herpesviridae, Anelloviridae, and Polyomaviridae. Importantly, we detected a novel human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV 3) strain with a 32-bp insertion in the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene that produced a negative result in the Luminex assay, highlighting the strength of virome metagenomic analysis to identify not only novel viruses but also viruses likely to be missed by ordinary clinical tests. Thus, virome metagenomic analysis could become a viable clinical diagnostic method. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - We describe a novel species of torque teno mini virus called TTMV-204, which was isolated from the gingival epithelium of patients with periodontitis and characterized using viral metagenomics. The sequence of the full genome is 2824 nt in length. Phylogenetic analysis and genetic analyses show classic Betatorquevirus species organization with less than 40% amino acid similarity in ORF1. The prevalence of TTMV-204 in the periodontitis patient population was 18.75% (15/80), which was higher than in periodontally healthy individuals (10.00%, 10/80). However, the difference of the TTMV-204 prevalence between two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.115). Further investigation is required to determine whether this new virus is associated with inflammation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno viruses, TTV) and other animals including swine (Torque teno sus viruses, TTSuV). Two genetically distinct TTSuV species have been identified from swine thus far (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), although their definitive association with disease remains debatable. In 2012, a novel TTSuV species was identified from commercial swine serum and classified in the genus Kappatorquevirus as TTSuVk2b. The other Kappatorquevirus species, TTSuVk2a, has been associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) when coinfected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Therefore, in this study, we initially amplified a portion of TTSuVk2b ORF1 and, subsequently, assessed the molecular prevalence of the virus in pigs in the United States. A total of 127 serum and 115 tissue samples were obtained from pigs with PMWS or mulberry heart disease (MHD) in six states and tested by PCR for the presence of TTSuVk2b DNA. Approximately 27.6% of the serum and 21.7% of tissue samples tested positive for TTSuVk2b DNA, and the positive products were confirmed by sequencing. However, we did not detect a correlation between TTSuVk2b infection and PMWS or MHD. The near full-length genomic sequence of US TTSuVk2b was determined, and sequence analysis revealed that the US TTSuVk2b isolates were 95% identical to the TTSuVk2b isolate from Spain, with most of the variations clustering in ORF1. We conclude that the novel TTSuVk2b species is present in pigs in the United States and its potential association with a disease warrants further investigation. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Hepatitis is a general term meaning inflammation of the liver, which can be caused by a variety of viruses. However, a substantial number of cases remain with unknown aetiology. We analysed the serum of patients with clinical signs of hepatitis using a metagenomics approach to characterize their viral species composition. Four pools of patients with hepatitis without identified aetiological agents were evaluated. Additionally, one pool of patients with hepatitis E (HEV) and pools of healthy volunteers were included as controls. A high diversity of anelloviruses, including novel sequences, was found in pools from patients with hepatitis of unknown aetiology. Moreover, viruses recently associated with gastroenteritis as sapovirus GV.2 and astrovirus VA3 were also detected only in those pools. Besides, most of the HEV genome was recovered from the HEV pool. Finally, GB virus C and human endogenous retrovirus were found in the HEV and healthy pools. Our study provides an overview of the virome in serum from hepatitis patients suggesting a potential role of these viruses not previously described in cases of hepatitis. However, further epidemiologic studies are necessary to confirm their contribution to the development of hepatitis. © 2017 Gonzales-Gustavson et al.

AB  - Circular single-stranded DNA viruses infect archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotic organisms. The relatively recent emergence of single-stranded DNA viruses, such as chicken anemia virus (CAV) and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2), as serious pathogens of eukaryotes is due more to growing awareness than to the appearance of new pathogens or alteration of existing pathogens. In the case of the ubiquitous human circular single-stranded DNA virus family Anelloviridae, there is still no convincing direct causal relation to any specific disease. However, infections may play a role in autoimmunity by changing the homeostatic balance of proinflammatory cytokines and the human immune system, indirectly affecting the severity of diseases caused by other pathogens. Infections with CAV (family Anelloviridae, genus Gyrovirus) and PCV2 (family Circoviridae, genus Circovirus) are presented here because they are immunosuppressive and affect health in domesticated animals. CAV shares genomic organization, genomic orientation, and common features of major proteins with human anelloviruses, and PCV2 DNA may be present in human food and vaccines.

AB  - The composition of the porcine virome includes viruses that infect pig cells, ancient virus-derived elements including endogenous retroviruses inserted in the pig chromosomes, and bacteriophages that infect a broad array of bacteria that inhabit pigs. Viruses infecting pigs, among them viruses also infecting human cells, as well as porcine endogenous retroviruses (PERVs) are of importance when evaluating the virus safety of xenotransplantation. Bacteriophages associated with bacteria mainly in the gut are not relevant in this context. Xenotransplantation using pig cells, tissues or organs is under development in order to alleviate the shortage of human transplants. Here for the first time published data describing the viromes in different pigs and their relevance for the virus safety of xenotransplantation is analysed. In conclusion, the analysis of the porcine virome has resulted in numerous new viruses being described, although their impact on xenotransplantation is unclear. Most importantly, viruses with known or suspected zoonotic potential were often not detected by next generation sequencing, but were revealed by more sensitive methods. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Rolling-circle amplification-sequence-independent single primer amplifications (RCA-SISPA) and/or RCA-PCR-based approaches were applied to serial human plasma and animal (domestic cat) saliva samples. Complete SENV-H-related and PRA4 Anelloviridae genomes were characterized and analysed over time (~ 16 and 6.5 years for human and animal samples, respectively). Genomic sequences and deduced putative coding regions were compared. Comparable values, i.e. ~ 2 × 10− 4 subs/site/year, were obtained for estimated rates of non-synonymous substitutions. A “hot-spot” of mutations located on the SENV-H-related ORF1 was identified. These results are first data concerning Anelloviridae evolution in a human and an animal host based on the analysis of complete sequences. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Thanks to the significant advent of high throughput sequencing in the last ten years, it is now possible via metagenomics to define the spectrum of the microbial sequences present in human blood samples. Therefore, metagenomics sequencing appears as a promising approach for the identification and global surveillance of new, emerging and/or unexpected viruses that could impair blood transfusion safety. However, despite considerable advantages compared to the traditional methods of pathogen identification, this non-targeted approach presents several drawbacks including a lack of sensitivity and sequence contaminant issues. With further improvements, especially to increase sensitivity, metagenomics sequencing should become in a near future an additional diagnostic tool in infectious disease field and especially in blood transfusion safety. © 2017 Elsevier Masson SAS

AB  - Much attention has been focused on the role of the bacterial microbiome in human health, but the virome is understudied. Although previously investigated in individuals with inflammatory bowel diseases or solid-organ transplants, virome dynamics in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and enteric graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) remain unexplored. Here we characterize the longitudinal gut virome in 44 recipients of HSCT using metagenomics. A viral 'bloom' was identified, and significant increases were demonstrated in the overall proportion of vertebrate viral sequences following transplantation (P = 0.02). Increases in both the rates of detection (P < 0.0001) and number of sequences (P = 0.047) of persistent DNA viruses (anelloviruses, herpesviruses, papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses) over time were observed in individuals with enteric GVHD relative to those without, a finding accompanied by a reduced phage richness (P = 0.01). Picobirnaviruses were detected in 18 individuals (40.9%), more frequently before or within a week after transplant than at later time points (P = 0.008). In a time-dependent Cox proportional-hazards model, picobirnaviruses were predictive of the occurrence of severe enteric GVHD (hazard ratio, 2.66; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.46-4.86; P = 0.001), and correlated with higher fecal levels of two GVHD severity markers, calprotectin and α1-Antitrypsin. These results reveal a progressive expansion of vertebrate viral infections over time following HSCT, and they suggest an unexpected association of picobirnaviruses with early post-Transplant GVHD. © Nature America, Inc., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Diarrhea is the major cause of non-research-associated morbidity and mortality affecting the supply of rhesus macaques and, potentially, their responses to experimental treatments. Idiopathic chronic diarrhea (ICD) in rhesus macaques also resembles ulcerative colitis, one form of human inflammatory bowel disease. To test for viral etiologies, we characterized and compared the fecal viromes from 32 healthy animals, 31 animals with acute diarrhea, and 29 animals with ICD. The overall fractions of eukaryotic viral reads were 0.063% for the healthy group, 0.131% for the acute-diarrhea group, and 0.297% for the chronic-diarrhea group. Eukaryotic viruses belonging to 6 viral families, as well as numerous circular Rep-encoding singlestranded DNA (CRESS DNA) viral genomes, were identified. The most commonly detected sequences were from picornaviruses, making up 59 to 88% of all viral reads, followed by 9 to 17% for CRESS DNA virus sequences. The remaining 5 virus families, Adenoviridae, Astroviridae, Anelloviridae, Picobirnaviridae, and Parvoviridae, collectively made up 1 to 3% of the viral reads, except for parvoviruses, which made up 23% of the viral reads in the healthy group. Detected members of the families Picornaviridae and Parvoviridae were highly diverse, consisting of multiple genera, species, and genotypes. Coinfections with members of up to six viral families were detected. Complete and partial viral genomes were assembled and used to measure the number of matching short sequence reads in feces from the 92 animals in the two clinical and the healthy control groups. Several enterovirus genotypes and CRESS DNA genomes were associated with ICD relative to healthy animals. Conversely, higher read numbers from different parvoviruses were associated with healthy animals. Our study reveals a high level of enteric coinfections with diverse viruses in a captive rhesus macaque colony and identifies several viruses positively or negatively associated with ICD. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - METHODS: Using a viral metagenomic approach, we surveyed viruses in the feces, nasopharyngeal secretions, blood, and different tissues from a wild giant panda that died from an unknown disease, a healthy wild giant panda, and 46 healthy captive animals.
RESULTS: The previously uncharacterized complete or near complete genomes of four viruses from three genera in Papillomaviridae family, six viruses in a proposed new Picornaviridae genus (Aimelvirus), two unclassified viruses related to posaviruses in Picornavirales order, 19 anelloviruses in four different clades of Anelloviridae family, four putative circoviruses, and 15 viruses belonging to the recently described Genomoviridae family were sequenced. Reflecting the diet of giant pandas, numerous insect virus sequences related to the families Iflaviridae, Dicistroviridae, Iridoviridae, Baculoviridae, Polydnaviridae, and subfamily Densovirinae and plant viruses sequences related to the families Tombusviridae, Partitiviridae, Secoviridae, Geminiviridae, Luteoviridae, Virgaviridae, and Rhabdoviridae; genus Umbravirus, Alphaflexiviridae, and Phycodnaviridae were also detected in fecal samples. A small number of insect virus sequences were also detected in the nasopharyngeal secretions of healthy giant pandas and lung tissues from the dead wild giant panda. Although the viral families present in the sick giant panda were also detected in the healthy ones, a higher proportion of papillomaviruses, picornaviruses, and anelloviruses reads were detected in the diseased panda.
CONCLUSION: This viral survey increases our understanding of eukaryotic viruses in giant pandas and provides a baseline for comparison to viruses detected in future infectious disease outbreaks. The similar viral families detected in sick and healthy giant pandas indicate that these viruses result in commensal infections in most immuno-competent animals.
BACKGROUND: The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca) is a vulnerable mammal herbivore living wild in central China. Viral infections have become a potential threat to the health of these endangered animals, but limited information related to these infections is available.

AB  - The torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently discovered DNA virus that has been detected in many different hosts, including humans, livestock and poultry. To date, there is no report of pigeon TTV (PTTV) from anywhere in the world. To investigate the distribution of PTTV in pigeons from the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu and characterize their genomes, we employed PCR to detect PTTV in 144 samples collected from 6 pigeon plants in Jiangsu province, amplify complete genomes from representative samples and analyze genetic characteristics using bioinformatics. The results demonstrated that 71.5% (103/144) of samples were PTTV positive. The rate of sequence homology among the six PTTV complete genomes obtained from Jiangsu province ranged from 99.7% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that PTTV genomes had a high degree of genetic similarity and were similar to chicken anemia virus that also had poultry as a host. Although with the same host, PTTV shared distant relationship with PiCV in both complete genome, Rep and Cap genes. The results of this study provided evidence that PTTV could be detected in Chinese pigeons at a high level, the evolutionary process of complete genome, Rep and Cap genes of Anelloviridae family had obvious divergence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although the risk of transmitting infectious agents by blood transfusion is dramatically reduced after donor selection, leukoreduction, and laboratory testing, some could still be present in donor's blood. A description of metagenomes in blood products eligible for transfusion represents relevant information to evaluate the risk of pathogen transmission by transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Detection of viruses, bacteria, and fungi genomes was made by high-throughput sequencing (HTS) of 600 manufactured blood products eligible for transfusion: 300 red blood cell (RBC) and 300 fresh-frozen plasma (FFP) units. RESULTS: Anelloviruses and human pegivirus, frequent in the blood of healthy individuals, were found. Human papillomavirus type 27 and Merkel cell polyomavirus, present on the skin, were also detected. Unexpectedly, astrovirus MLB2 was identified and characterized in a FFP unit. The presence of astrovirus MLB2 was confirmed in donor's blood and corresponded to an asymptomatic acute viremia. Sequences of bacteria and fungi were also detected; they are likely the result of environmental contamination. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that HTS is a promising tool for detecting common and less frequent infectious pathogens in blood products. © 2017 AABB

AB  - Acute leukemia is the most common pediatric cancer, representing one-third of all cancers that occurs in under 15 year olds, with a varied incidence worldwide. Although a number of advances have increased the knowledge of leukemia pathophysiology, its etiology remains less well understood. The role of infectious agents, such as viruses, bacteria, or parasites, in the pathogenesis of leukemia has been discussed. To date, several cellular mechanisms involving infectious agents have been proposed to cause leukemia following infections. However, although leukemia can be triggered by contact with such agents, they can also be beneficial in developing immune stimulation and protection despite the risk of leukemic clones. In this review, we analyze the proposed hypotheses concerning how infectious agents may play a role in the origin and development of leukemia, as well as in a possible mechanism of protection following infections. We review reported clinical observations associated with vaccination or breastfeeding, that support hypotheses such as early life exposure and the resulting early immune stimulation that lead to protection. © 2017 IMSS

AB  - The family Circoviridae contains viruses with covalently closed, circular, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genomes, including the smallest known autonomously replicating, capsid-encoding animal pathogens. Members of this family are known to cause fatal diseases in birds and pigs and have been historically classified in one of two genera: Circovirus, which contains avian and porcine pathogens, and Gyrovirus, which includes a single species (Chicken anemia virus). However, over the course of the past six years, viral metagenomic approaches as well as degenerate PCR detection in unconventional hosts and environmental samples have elucidated a broader host range, including fish, a diversity of mammals, and invertebrates, for members of the family Circoviridae. Notably, these methods have uncovered a distinct group of viruses that are closely related to members of the genus Circovirus and comprise a new genus, Cyclovirus. The discovery of new viruses and a re-evaluation of genomic features that characterize members of the Circoviridae prompted a revision of the classification criteria used for this family of animal viruses. Here we provide details on an updated Circoviridae taxonomy ratified by the International Committee on the Taxonomy of Viruses in 2016, which establishes the genus Cyclovirus and reassigns the genus Gyrovirus to the family Anelloviridae, a separate lineage of animal viruses that also contains circular ssDNA genomes. In addition, we provide a new species demarcation threshold of 80% genome-wide pairwise identity for members of the family Circoviridae, based on pairwise identity distribution analysis, and list guidelines to distinguish between members of this family and other eukaryotic viruses with circular, ssDNA genomes. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - An Iranian field strain of chicken anemia virus (CAV), designated IR CAV, was isolated in the Marek’s disease virus-transformed lymphoblastoid cell line MDCC-MSB1 (MSB1) culture for the first time. The full-length CAV DNA of this strain was cloned in the bacterial plasmid pTZ57R/T to create the molecular clone pTZ-CAV. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of viral proteins of IR CAV were compared with those of representative CAV sequences including reference and commercial vaccine strains. IR CAV was not related to vaccine strains and also found to have glutamine at positions 139 and 144 confirming previous studies in which such mutations were associated with a slow rate of virus spread in cell culture. pTZ-CAV was digested with PstI to release IR CAV DNA and then transfected into MSB1 cell by electroporation. The transfected cells showed cytopathic effect similar to virion-initiated infection. One-day old specific pathogen-free chicks were inoculated with the regenerated virus, which had been obtained from transfected MSB1 cells, and compared with the chicks inoculated with IR CAV. Gross lesions in the birds inoculated with the regenerated virus illustrated the infectious nature of the regenerated virus from the cloned IR CAV DNA. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Background. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) remains poorly understood. Although infections are speculated to trigger the syndrome, a specific infectious agent and underlying pathophysiological mechanism remain elusive. In a previous study, we described similar clinical phenotypes in CFS patients and alternatively diagnosed chronic Lyme syndrome (ADCLS) patients'individuals diagnosed with Lyme disease by testing from private Lyme specialty laboratories but who test negative by reference 2-tiered serologic analysis. Methods. Here, we performed blinded RNA-seq analysis of whole blood collected from 25 adults diagnosed with CFS and 13 ADCLS patients, comparing these cases to 25 matched controls and 11 patients with well-controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Samples were collected at patient enrollment and not during acute symptom flares. RNA-seq data were used to study host gene expression, B-cell/T-cell receptor profiles (BCR/TCR), and potential viral infections. Results. No differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be significant when CFS or ADCLS cases were compared to controls. Forty-two DEGs were found when SLE cases were compared to controls, consistent with activation of interferon signaling pathways associated with SLE disease. BCR/TCR repertoire analysis did not show significant differences between CFS and controls or ADCLS and controls. Finally, viral sequences corresponding to anelloviruses, human pegivirus 1, herpesviruses, and papillomaviruses were detected in RNA-seq data, but proportions were similar (P = .73) across all genus-level taxonomic categories. Conclusions. Our observations do not support a theory of transcriptionally mediated immune cell dysregulation in CFS and ADCLS, at least outside of periods of acute symptom flares. © The Author 2017.

AB  - The role of viral infections in the etiology of brain cancer remains uncertain. Prior studies mostly focused on transcriptome or viral DNA integrated in tumor cells. To investigate for the presence of viral particles, we performed metagenomics sequencing on viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from 12 primary and 8 metastatic human brain tumors. One brain tumor metastasized from a skin melanoma harbored two new human anellovirus species, Torque teno mini virus Emory1 (TTMV Emory1) and Emory2 (TTMV Emory2), while the remaining 19 samples did not reveal any exogenous viral sequences. Their genomes share 63-67% identity with other TTMVs, and phylogenetic clustering supports their classification within the Betatorquevirus genus. This is the first identification of betatorqueviruses in brain tumors. The viral DNA was in its expected non-integrated circular form, and it is unclear if the viruses contributed to tumor formation. Whether the viruses originated from blood, or the primary skin tumor could not be ascertained. Overall, our results demonstrate the usefulness of viral metagenomics to detect previously unknown exogenous virus in human brain tumors. They further suggest that active viral infections are rare events in brain tumors, but support a follow-up larger scale study to quantify their frequency in different brain tumor subtypes. © Fan Ng et al.

AB  - Purpose of review: Despite HIV therapy advances, average life expectancy in HIV-infected individuals on effective treatment is significantly decreased relative to uninfected persons, largely because of increased incidence of inflammation-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and renal dysfunction. The enteric microbial community could potentially cause this inflammation, as HIV-driven destruction of gastrointestinal CD4- T cells may disturb the microbiota-mucosal immune system balance, disrupting the stable gut microbiome and leading to further deleterious host outcomes. Recent findings: Varied enteric microbiome changes have been reported during HIV infection, but unifying patterns have emerged. Community diversity is decreased, similar to pathologies such as inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and Clostridium difficile infection. Many taxa frequently enriched in HIV-infected individuals, such as Enterobacteriaceae and Erysipelotrichaceae, have pathogenic potential, whereas depleted taxa, such as Bacteroidaceae and Ruminococcaceae, are more linked with anti-inflammatory properties and maintenance of gut homeostasis. The gut viral community in HIV has been found to contain a greater abundance of pathogenesis-associated Adenoviridae and Anelloviridae. These bacterial and viral changes correlate with increased systemic inflammatory markers, such as serum sCD14, sCD163, and IL-6. Summary: Enteric microbial community changes may contribute to chronic HIV pathogenesis, but more investigation is necessary, especially in the developing world population with the greatest HIV burden (Video, Supplemental Digital Content 1, http://links.lww.com/COID/A15, which includes the authors' summary of the importance of the work).

AB  - Background. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization. Pathogen identification fails in approximately 20% of children but is critical for optimal treatment and prevention of hospital-acquired infections. We used two broad-spectrum detection strategies to identify pathogens in test-negative children with CAP and asymptomatic controls. Methods. Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal (NP/OP) swabs from 70 children >5 years with CAP of unknown etiology and 90 asymptomatic controls were tested by next-generation sequencing (RNA-seq) and pan viral group (PVG) PCR for 19 viral families. Association of viruses with CAP was assessed by adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals controlling for season and age group. Results. RNA-seq/PVG PCR detected previously missed, putative pathogens in 34% of patients. Putative viral pathogens included human parainfluenza virus 4 (aOR 9.3, P = .12), human bocavirus (aOR 9.1, P < .01), Coxsackieviruses (aOR 5.1, P = .09), rhinovirus A (aOR 3.5, P = .34), and rhinovirus C (aOR 2.9, P = .57). RNA-seq was more sensitive for RNA viruses whereas PVG PCR detected more DNA viruses. Conclusions. RNA-seq and PVG PCR identified additional viruses, some known to be pathogenic, in NP/OP specimens from one-third of children hospitalized with CAP without a previously identified etiology. Both broad-range methods could be useful tools in future epidemiologic and diagnostic studies. © The Author 2017. Published by Oxford University Press for the Infectious Diseases Society.

AB  - Background: Anelloviruses (TTV, TTMV, and TTMDV) have been associated with non A-G hepatitis. The goal of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of these anelloviruses in Qatar. Methods: A total of 607 blood samples (500 healthy donors, and 53 HBV-and 54 HCV-positive patients) representing different nationalities were tested for the presence of TTV, TTMV, and TTMDV DNA by nested PCR. Results: Prevalence rates for the three viruses were high in all studied groups, and exceeding 95% in the HBV group (for TTV and TTMDV). Infection with more than one type of viruses was common and significant in most of the positive patients (p < 0.05) and ranging from 55.4% for TTV/TTMV and TTMV/TTMDV co-infections in the healthy group, to 96.3% for TTV/TTMV co-infections in the HBV group. Further, and as with most previous studies, no significant association was found between anelloviruses infections and age, nationality, or gender (p > 0.05) albeit the detection of higher infection rates among females and Qatari subjects. Conclusion: This was the first published study to look at prevalence of Anellowviruses in the Middle East. High prevalence rates of the three viruses in all studied groups was noted. Further studies are needed to explore and compare the different genotypes of these viruses in the region. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Viral nucleic acids present in the plasma of 498 Kenyan adults with unexplained fever were characterized by metagenomics analysis of 51 sample pools. The highest to lowest fraction of plasma pools was positive for parvovirus B19 (75%), pegivirus C (GBV-C) (67%), alpha anellovirus (59%), gamma anellovirus (55%), beta anellovirus (41%), dengue virus genotype 2 (DENV-2) (16%), human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (6%), human herpesvirus 6 (6%), HBV (4%), rotavirus (4%), hepatitis B virus (4%), rhinovirus C (2%), Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCPyV; 2%) and Kadipiro virus (2%). Ranking by overall percentage of viral reads yielded similar results. Characterization of viral nucleic acids in the plasma of a febrile East African population showed a high frequency of parvovirus B19 and DENV infections and detected a reovirus (Kadipiro virus) previously reported only in Asian Culex mosquitoes, providing a baseline to compare with future virome studies to detect emerging viruses in this region. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The development of high-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed the possibility to investigate and characterise the entire microbiome of individuals, providing better insight to the complex interaction between different microorganisms. This will help to understand how the microbiome influence the susceptibility of secondary agents and development of disease. We have applied viral metagenomics to investigate the virome of lymph nodes from Swedish pigs suffering from the multifactorial disease postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as well as from healthy pigs. The aim is to increase knowledge of potential viruses, apart from porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), involved in PMWS development as well as to increase knowledge on the virome of healthy individuals. In healthy individuals, a diverse viral flora was seen with several different viruses present simultaneously. The majority of the identified viruses were small linear and circular DNA viruses, such as different circoviruses, anelloviruses and bocaviruses. In the pigs suffering from PMWS, PCV2 sequences were, as expected, detected to a high extent but other viruses were also identified in the background of PCV2. Apart from DNA viruses also RNA viruses were identified, among them were a porcine pestivirus showing high similarity to a recently (in 2015) discovered atypical porcine pestivirus in the US. Majority of the viruses identified in the background of PCV2 in PMWS pigs could also be identified in the healthy pigs. PCV2 sequences were also identified in the healthy pigs but to a much lower extent than in PMWS affected pigs. Although the method used here is not quantitative the very clear difference in amount of PCV2 sequences in PMWS affected pigs and healthy pigs most likely reflect the very strong replication of PCV2 known to be a hallmark of PMWS. Taken together, these findings illustrate that pigs appear to have a considerable viral flora consisting to a large extent of small single-stranded and circular DNA viruses. Future research on these types of viruses will help to better understand the role that these ubiquitous viruses may have on health and disease of pigs. We also demonstrate for the first time, in Europe, the presence of a novel porcine pestivirus. © 2016 Blomström et al.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV), member of Anelloviridae family, is considered a worldwide distributed emergent virus and is currently classified into seven genogroups. Interestingly, the pathogenicity of TTV remains unclear. However, it has been constantly associated to hepatitis cases of unknown etiology (HUE) as well as extensively studied in concurrent infections with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1). In South America, TTV epidemiological data is scant, involving some studies from Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia. The aim of this work was to investigate for the first time in Uruguay the presence of TTV by a nested-PCR system in 85 human serum samples infected with HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV-1 and in HUE cases. Overall, our results reported a TTV infection rate of 79% (67/85). Furthermore, the molecular characterization of Uruguayan strains revealed that one of them clustered in genogroup 1, while the remaining ones formed separate clusters closely related to genogroup 3, which should be confirmed by complete genome sequencing. Further investigation about TTV circulation in Uruguayan population is needed in order to provide additional information about the genetic variability and TTV epidemiology in South America. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Feral swine are known reservoirs for various pathogens that can adversely affect domestic animals. To assess the viral ecology of feral swine in the USA, metagenomic sequencing was performed on 100 pooled nasal swabs. The virome was dominated by small, ssDNA viruses belonging to the families Circoviridae, Anelloviridae and Parvovirinae. Only four RNA viruses were identified: porcine kobuvirus, porcine sapelovirus, atypical porcine pestivirus and a novel Orthopneumovirus, provisionally named swine orthopneumovirus (SOV). SOV shared ~90% nucleotide identity to murine pneumonia virus (MPV) and canine pneumovirus. A modified, commercially available ELISA for MPV found that approximately 30% of both feral and domestic swine sera were positive for antibodies cross-reactive with MPV. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR identified two (2 %) and four (5.0 %) positive nasal swab pools from feral and domestic swine, respectively, confirming that SOV circulates in both herds. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The identification of viruses in human blood is required for epidemiologic surveillance and to detect potentially emerging threats to blood transfusion safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Viral nucleic acids in plasma fractionation pools assembled from blood donors in the United States and Europe were analyzed by viral metagenomics. RESULTS: Anelloviruses were detected in each of the 10 plasma pools. Human pegivirus A (HPgV; GB virus type C) sequences were identified in eight of the 10 pools, more than 90% of which belong to Genotype 2. The recently described human HPgV2 in Flaviviridae was not detected. A small number of sequence reads of human papillomavirus were also detected in three pools. In one pool, two different gemycircularvirus genomes were identified and fully sequenced. The capsid protein of one gemycircularvirus shared 83% to 84% identity to those of genomes from human serum and sewage. The presence of the gemycircularvirus genomes in the plasma pool was independently confirmed and the viral concentration estimated by digital PCR at more than 106 copies/mL assuming their origin from single donors. CONCLUSION: Further research is required to elucidate whether gemycircularviruses can infect humans or are indicative of contamination occurring during phlebotomy, plasma pool processing, or ongoing donor fungal infections. © 2016 AABB

AB  - Background: Characterisation of human-associated viral communities is essential for epidemiological surveillance and to be able to anticipate new potential threats for blood transfusion safety. In high-resource countries, the risk of blood-borne agent transmission of well-known viruses (HBV, HCV, HIV and HTLV) is currently considered to be under control. However, other unknown or unsuspected viruses may be transmitted to recipients by blood-derived products. To investigate this, the virome of plasma from individuals at high risk for parenterally and sexually transmitted infections was analysed by high throughput sequencing (HTS). Materials and methods: Purified nucleic acids from two pools of 50 samples from recipients of multiple transfusions, and three pools containing seven plasma samples from either HBV-, HCV- or HIV-infected blood donors, were submitted to HTS. Results: Sequences from resident anelloviruses and HPgV were evidenced in all pools. HBV and HCV sequences were detected in pools containing 3.8×103 IU/mL of HBV-DNA and 1.7×105 IU/mL of HCV-RNA, respectively, whereas no HIV sequence was found in a pool of 150 copies/mL of HIV-RNA. This suggests a lack of sensitivity in HTS performance in detecting low levels of virus. In addition, this study identified other issues, including laboratory contaminants and the uncertainty of taxonomic assignment of short sequence. No sequence suggestive of a new viral species was identified. Discussion: This study did not identify any new blood-borne virus in high-risk individuals. However, rare and/or viruses present at very low titre could have escaped our protocol. Our results demonstrate the positive contribution of HTS in the detection of viral sequences in blood donations. © SIMTI Servizi Srl.

AB  - Here, a novel feline anellovirus strain (named FelineAV621 and GenBank no. KX262893) was detected in two cats with diarrhea. The complete genome of FelineAV621 is 2409 nt long with a G+C content of 56.67 %, including three open reading frames (ORFs). Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequence of the putative capsid protein (ORF1) indicated that FelineAV621 belonged to a novel anellovirus species inside a clade containing the seal anellovirus, canine TTVs, and porcine TTVs, but was distant from all the previous feline anelloviruses. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Aim of this study was the retrospective investigation of viral (porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), torque teno sus virus type 1 and 2 (TTSuV1, TTSuV2)) and bacterial (Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. b.), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. h.), and Pasteurella multocida (P. m.)) co-infections in 110 Pneumocystis spp. positive lung samples of Austrian pigs with pneumonia. Fifty-one % were positive for PCV2, 7% for PRRSV, 22% for TTSuV1, 48% for TTSuV2, 6% for B. b., 29% for M. h., and 21% for P. m. In 38.2% only viral, in 3.6% only bacterial and in 40.0% both, viral and bacterial pathogens were detected. In 29.1% of the cases a co-infection with 1 pathogen, in 28.2% with 2, in 17.3% with 3, and in 7.3% with 4 different infectious agents were observed. The exposure to Pneumocystis significantly decreased the risk of a co-infection with PRRSV in weaning piglets; all other odds ratios were not significant. Four categories of results were compared: I = P. spp. + only viral co-infectants, II = P. spp. + both viral and bacterial co-infectants, III = P. spp. + only bacterial co-infectants, and IV = P. spp. single infection. The evaluation of all samples and the age class of the weaning piglets resulted in a predomination of the categories I and II. In contrast, the suckling piglets showed more samples of category I and IV. In the group of fattening pigs, category II predominated. Suckling piglets can be infected with P. spp. early in life. With increasing age this single infections can be complicated by co-infections with other respiratory diseases. © 2016 Weissenbacher-Lang et al.

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) is a widespread anellovirus that establishes persistent infections in human showing an increased viremia in immunosuppressed patients. TTV possesses microRNA (miRNA)-coding sequences that might be involved in viral immune evasion. Here, the presence of TTV DNA and miRNAs expression was investigated in plasma samples of 77 diseased (20 infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 18 infected with hepatitis B (HBV) virus, 18 infected with hepatitis C (HCV) virus, 21 solid organ transplanted) patients, and 25 healthy controls. TTV prevalence was significantly different in healthy controls (60%, 15/25) versus diseased patients (80%, 62/77), showing the highest TTV loads in transplant recipients. Genetic TTV analysis showed the highest prevalence of group 1, followed by groups 3, 4 and 5, and a lack of isolates of group 2. The expression of at least one TTV miRNAs of group 1, 3 and 5 was found in exosomes of plasma of the great majority of individuals (96%, 98/102 subjects) showing the higher prevalence of miRNAs of TTV group 3 (90%, 92/102), followed by miRNAs of group 1 (66%, 67/102), and miRNA of group 5 (49%, 50/102). TTV miRNAs expression and TTV viremia were not always directly correlated, and significant differences appeared in production of some TTV miRNAs between healthy controls and diseased patients. The reported TTV miRNAs status in exosomes encourages further investigation to understand their potential role in the expansion of anelloviruses upon immunosuppression. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) in children is thought to be mainly caused by infection with various viruses, some of which have been well characterized; however, analyses of respiratory tract viromes among children with SARI versus those without are limited. In this study, nasopharyngeal swabs from children with and without SARI (135 versus 15) were collected in China between 2008 and 2010 and subjected to multiplex metagenomic analyses using a next-generation sequencing platform. The results show that members of the Paramyxoviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Picornaviridae, Anelloviridae and Adenoviridae families represented the most abundant species identified (>50% genome coverage) in the respiratory tracts of children with SARI. The viral population found in the respiratory tracts of children without SARI was less diverse and mainly dominated by the Anelloviridae family with only a small proportion of common epidemic respiratory viruses. Several almost complete viral genomes were assembled, and the genetic diversity was determined among several samples based on next-generation sequencing. This research provides comprehensive mapping of the viromes of children with SARI and indicates high heterogeneity of known viruses present in the childhood respiratory tract, which may benefit the detection and prevention of respiratory disease. © 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

AB  - A possible role for infections of the pregnant mother in the development of childhood acute leukemias and lymphomas has been suggested. However, no specific infectious agent has been identified. Offspring of 74,000 mothers who had serum samples taken during pregnancy and stored in a large-scale biobank were followed up to the age of 15 years (750,000 person years) through over-generation linkages between the biobank files, the Swedish national population and cancer registers to identify incident leukemia/lymphoma cases in the offspring. First-trimester sera from mothers of 47 cases and 47 matched controls were retrieved and analyzed using next generation sequencing. Anelloviruses were the most common viruses detected, found in 37/47 cases and in 40/47 controls, respectively (OR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.2-1.9). None of the detected viruses was associated with leukemia/lymphoma in the offspring. Viremia during pregnancy was common, but no association with leukemia/lymphoma risk in the offspring was found. © 2015 UICC.

AB  - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with increased intestinal translocation of microbial products and enteropathy as well as alterations in gut bacterial communities. However, whether the enteric virome contributes to this infection and resulting immunodeficiency remains unknown. We characterized the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome in a cohort of Ugandan patients, including HIV-uninfected or HIV-infected subjects and those either treated with anti-retroviral therapy (ART) or untreated. Low peripheral CD4 T cell counts were associated with an expansion of enteric adenovirus sequences and this increase was independent of ART treatment. Additionally, the enteric bacterial microbiome of patients with lower CD4 T counts exhibited reduced phylogenetic diversity and richness with specific bacteria showing differential abundance, including increases in Enterobacteriaceae, which have been associated with inflammation. Thus, immunodeficiency in progressive HIV infection is associated with alterations in the enteric virome and bacterial microbiome, which may contribute to AIDS-associated enteropathy and disease progression. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Neonatal porcine diarrhoea of uncertain aetiology has been reported from a number of European countries. The aim of the present study was to use viral metagenomics to examine a potential viral involvement in this diarrhoea and to describe the intestinal virome with focus on eukaryotic viruses. Samples from the distal jejunum of 50 diarrhoeic and 19 healthy piglets from 10 affected herds were analysed. The viral fraction of the samples was isolated and nucleic acids (RNA and DNA fractions) were subjected to sequence independent amplification. Samples from diarrhoeic piglets from the same herds were pooled whereas samples from healthy piglets were analysed individually. In total, 29 clinical samples, plus two negative controls and one positive control consisting of a mock metagenome were sequenced using the Ion Torrent platform. The resulting sequence data was subjected to taxonomic classification using Kraken, Diamond and HMMER. In the healthy specimens, eight different mammalian virus families were detected (Adenoviridae, Anelloviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae) compared to four in the pooled diarrhoeic samples (Anelloviridae, Circoviridae, Picornaviridae, and Reoviridae). It was not possible to associate a particular virus family with the investigated diarrhoea. In conclusion, this study does not support the hypothesis that the investigated diarrhoea was caused by known mammalian viruses. The results do, however, indicate that known mammalian viruses were present in the intestine as early as 24-48 hours after birth, indicating immediate infection post-partum or possibly transplacental infection. © 2016 Karlsson et al.

AB  - The Brazilian South coast seasonally hosts numerous marine species, observed particularly during winter months. Some animals, including fur seals, are found dead or debilitated along the shore and may harbor potential pathogens within their microbiota. In the present study, a metagenomic approach was performed to evaluate the viral diversity in feces of fur seals found deceased along the coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. The fecal virome of two fur seal species was characterized: the South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) and the Subantarctic fur seal (Arctocephalus tropicalis). Fecal samples from 10 specimens (A. australis, n = 5; A. tropicalis, n = 5) were collected and viral particles were purified, extracted and amplified with a random PCR. The products were sequenced through Ion Torrent and Illumina platforms and assembled reads were submitted to BLASTx searches. Both viromes were dominated by bacteriophages and included a number of potentially novel virus genomes. Sequences of picobirnaviruses, picornaviruses and a hepevirus-like were identified in A. australis. A rotavirus related to group C, a novel member of the Sakobuvirus and a sapovirus very similar to California sea lion sapovirus 1 were found in A. tropicalis. Additionally, sequences of members of the Anelloviridae and Parvoviridae families were detected in both fur seal species. This is the first metagenomic study to screen the fecal virome of fur seals, contributing to a better understanding of the complexity of the viral community present in the intestinal microbiota of these animals. © 2016 Kluge et al.

AB  - Until recently, knowledge of the pathogenicity of Circoviridae and Anelloviridae family members was limited. Our previous discoveries provided clues toward resolving this issue based on studies of the latent nature of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) genotype group members. We developed a conventional pig infection model that indicated that weaners already harbored latent PCV2 infection in the thymus, which enabled the viruses to specifically modulate the maturation of T-helper cells. This finding raised the possibility that the thymi of normal fetuses were already infected with PCV2. The present findings further substantiate our hypothesis that PCV2 masquerades as the host by infecting fetuses before they acquire immune-competence. We provide the first demonstration that all domestic pig fetuses preferentially harbor latent PCV2-infected cells in their thymi. These PCV2-infected cells are different from thymocytes and are located in the medulla of the fetal thymus. These latent PCV2-infected cells in fetuses are found at the same location and share characteristics with the infected cells observed in adolescent pigs. Moreover, fetuses also harbor these infected cells in other lymph system organs. We provide the first demonstration that the fetal thymus virus pools are minimally affected by sow vaccination, highlighting the immune-privileged character of this organ. Furthermore, we found a striking reduction in virus-infected cells in the fetal spleen and an increase in PCV2-infected cells in the fetal intestine of anti-PCV2-vaccinated mothers. These data indicate that specific immune response interactions occur between mothers and their progeny that are not dependent on the humoral immunity of the mother and cannot be attributed to the rudimentary humoral responses of the fetuses because these pig fetuses do not have any PCV2-specific antibodies. These shifts in our understanding of the PCV2-infected cell pool will lead to different avenues in the search for effective vaccination strategies against latent and chronic pathogens. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The potential to rapidly capture the entire microbial community structure and/or gene content makes metagenomic sequencing an attractive tool for pathogen identification and the detection of resistance/virulence genes in clinical settings. Here, we assessed the consistency between PCR from a diagnostic laboratory, quantitative PCR (qPCR) from a research laboratory, 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) for Clostridium difficile identification in diarrhea stool samples. Twenty-Two C. difficile-positive diarrhea samples identified by PCR and qPCR and five C. difficile-negative diarrhea controls were studied. C. difficile was detected in 90.9% of C. difficile-positive samples using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, and C. difficile was detected in 86.3% of C. difficile-positive samples using MSS. CFU inferred from qPCR analysis were positively correlated with the relative abundance of C. difficile from 16S rRNA gene sequencing (r2=0.60) and MSS (r2=0.55). C. difficile was codetected with Clostridium perfringens, norovirus, sapovirus, parechovirus, and anellovirus in 3.7% to 27.3% of the samples. A high load of Candida spp. was found in a symptomatic control sample in which no causative agents for diarrhea were identified in routine clinical testing. Beta-lactamase and tetracycline resistance genes were the most prevalent (25.9%) antibiotic resistance genes in these samples. In summary, the proof-of-concept study demonstrated that next-generation sequencing (NGS) in pathogen detection is moderately correlated with laboratory testing and is advantageous in detecting pathogens without a priori knowledge.

AB  - Anelloviridae family is comprised of small, non-enveloped viruses of various genome lengths, high sequence diversity, sharing the same genome organization. Infections and co-infections by different genotypes in humans are ubiquitous. Related viruses were described in number of mammalian hosts, but very limited data are available from the closest human relatives - great apes and non-human primates.Here we report the 100% prevalence determined by semi-nested PCR from fecal samples of 16 captive primate species. Only the Mandrillus sphinx, showed the prevalence only 8%. We describe three new species of gorillas[U+05F3] and four new species of chimpanzees[U+05F3] Betatorqueviruses and their co-infections in one individual. This study is also first report and analysis of nearly full length TTMV genomes infecting gorillas. Our attempts to sequence the complete genomes of anelloviruses from host feces invariably failed. Broader usage of blood /tissue material is necessary to understand the diversity and interspecies transmission of anelloviruses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS) is an important tool for characterizing viral populations. It is culture independent, requires no a priori knowledge of the viruses in the sample, and may provide useful genomic information. However, MSS can lack sensitivity and may yield insufficient data for detailed analysis. We have created a targeted sequence capture panel, ViroCap, designed to enrich nucleic acid from DNA and RNA viruses from 34 families that infect vertebrate hosts. A computational approach condensed ~1 billion bp of viral reference sequence into <200 million bp of unique, representative sequence suitable for targeted sequence capture. We compared the effectiveness of detecting viruses in standard MSS versus MSS following targeted sequence capture. First, we analyzed two sets of samples, one derived from samples submitted to a diagnostic virology laboratory and one derived from samples collected in a study of fever in children. We detected 14 and 18 viruses in the two sets, comprising 19 genera from 10 families, with dramatic enhancement of genome representation following capture enrichment. The median fold-increases in percentage viral reads post-capture were 674 and 296. Median breadth of coverage increased from 2.1% to 83.2% post-capture in the first set and from 2.0% to 75.6% in the second set. Next, we analyzed samples containing a set of diverse anellovirus sequences and demonstrated that ViroCap could be used to detect viral sequences with up to 58% variation from the references used to select capture probes. ViroCap substantially enhances MSS for a comprehensive set of viruses and has utility for research and clinical applications. © 2015 Robin et al.

AB  - Background: Torque Teno Midi Virus/Small Anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the Gammatorquevirus genus within the family Anelloviridae. It is detected in healthy, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus and HIV infected individuals and also patients with acute respiratory disease in different countries, but its role in clinical diseases and its full geographical distribution is still unclear. Objectives: The current study aimed to detect the frequency of infection with TTMDV/SAV in the sera of healthy blood donors, hepatitis C infected and HIV positive individuals in Lorestan province, Iran; and also investigate the possible role of TTMDV/SAV virus in liver diseases. Materials and Methods: Fifty two, 36, 4, and 110 serum samples from HIV positive, patients with HIV/HCV and HIV/HCV/HBV co-infections, and healthy individuals were collected in Khorramabad city, respectively. Nested-polymerase chain reaction was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers to detect TTMDV/SAV DNA. Serum aminotransferases were measured. Results: In the HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HIV, and control cases, 29 (80.5%), 3 (75%), 43 (82.7%), and 16 (14.5%) were positive for DNA of TTMDV/SAV, respectively. In the HIV/HCV infected cases and HIV positive cases the level of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly different in TTMDV/SAV infected and non-infected individuals (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Although significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed in the frequency of TTMDV/SAV between healthy controls and each of the HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, no significant difference was observed between HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected cases, which may be due to HIV associated immunodeficiency. This is the first time that TTMDV/SAV is reported in HIV infected individuals worldwide. Interpretation of the high frequency of the virus (82.7%) in HIV cases needs more detailed studies. © 2015, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Background: Abnormally high levels of T-cell activation can persist in HIV-infected subjects despite effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and has been associated with negative health outcomes. The nature of the antigenic drivers or other causes of this residual T-cell activation remain uncertain. Anelloviruses are universally acquired soon after birth, resulting in persistent viremia, and considered part of the commensal human virome. Reduced immunocompetence results in increased anellovirus levels. Objectives: To test whether increased levels of anelloviruses or other viruses in plasma are associated with higher levels of persistent T-cell activation during ART. Study design: Two amplification methods combined with next generation sequencing were used to detect all viruses and estimate relative anellovirus levels in plasma from 19 adults on effective ART who exhibited a wide range of T-cell activation levels. Results: Nucleic acids from HBV and HCV were detected in one patient each while pegivirus A (GBV-C) was found in three patients. Anellovirus DNA was detected in all patients with some individuals carrying up to eight different genotypes. Specific anellovirus genotypes or higher level of co-infections were not detected in subjects with higher levels of T-cell activation. No association was detected between relative plasma anellovirus DNA levels and the percentage of activated CD4 or CD8 T cells. Conclusions: Human anelloviruses were detected in all HIV suppressed subjects, exhibited a wide range of viremia levels, and were genetically highly diverse. The level of persistent T-cell activation was not correlated with the level of viremia or genotypes present indicating that anellovirus antigens are unlikely to be a dominant source of antigens driving chronic T-cell activation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV, family Anelloviridae) cause long lasting and persistent infection in pigs under subclinical scenarios, and are potentially linked to several economically important swine diseases. Currently, little is known about swine immune response against TTSuV infections. In this study, an ELISA assay was developed based on the ORF1-A recombinant protein of two known TTSuVs, namely TTSuV1 (genus Iotatorquevirus) and TTSuV2 (genus Kappatorquevirus). The assay was used to study the development of the humoral immune response against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in longitudinally sampled clinically healthy pigs and their dams. Anti ORF1-A IgG was found in serum of pigs and sows for both TTSuVs. From 15 sows, 15 (100%) and 13 (83%) had anti ORF1-A IgG against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. Pig sero-prevalences at the first sampling (4 weeks of age) were 65% (24/37) and 5% (2/37) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. For TTSuV1, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at weeks 21 and 25, with 68% (25/37) sero-positive pigs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results at week 21 revealed that 26 out of 32 (81%) pigs were positive for TTSuV1. In the case of TTSuV2, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at week 21, with 84% (31/37) pigs being sero-positive. At the same week, 92% (34/37) of pigs were qPCR positive. In summary, anti ORF1-A IgGs were detected in both sows and piglets at different ages, indicating that these animals could mount a humoral immune response against both TTSuVs. However, the high percentage of viremic pigs in presence of anti ORF1-A IgG suggests that these antibodies are not able to remove TTSuVs from circulation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The bacterial component of the human gut microbiota undergoes a definable program of postnatal development. Evidence is accumulating that this program is disrupted in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and that their persistent gut microbiota immaturity, which is not durably repaired with current ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) interventions, is causally related to disease pathogenesis. To further characterize gut microbial community development in healthy versus malnourished infants/children, we performed a time-series metagenomic study of DNA isolated from virus-like particles (VLPs) recovered from fecal samples collected during the first 30 mo of postnatal life from eight pairs of monoand dizygotic Malawian twins concordant for healthy growth and 12 twin pairs discordant for SAM. Both members of discordant pairs were sampled just before, during, and after treatment with a peanut-based RUTF. Using Random Forests and a dataset of 17,676 viral contigs assembled from shotgun sequencing reads of VLP DNAs, we identified viruses that distinguish different stages in the assembly of the gut microbiota in the concordant healthy twin pairs. This developmental program is impaired in both members of SAM discordant pairs and not repaired with RUTF. Phage plus members of the Anelloviridae and Circoviridae families of eukaryotic viruses discriminate discordant from concordant healthy pairs. These results disclose that apparently healthy cotwins in discordant pairs have viromes associated with, although not necessarily mediators, of SAM; as such, they provide a human model for delineating normal versus perturbed postnatal acquisition and retention of the gut microbiota's viral component in populations at risk for malnutrition.

AB  - Metagenomics was used to characterize viral genomes in clinical specimens of horses with various organ-specific diseases of unknown aetiology. A novel parvovirus as well as a previously described hepacivirus closely related to human hepatitis C virus and equid herpesvirus 2 were identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of horses with neurological signs. Four co-infecting picobirnaviruses, including an unusual genome with fused RNA segments, and a divergent anellovirus were found in the plasma of two febrile horses. A novel cyclovirus genome was characterized from the nasal secretion of another febrile animal. Lastly, a small circular DNA genome with a Rep gene, from a virus we called kirkovirus, was identified in the liver and spleen of a horse with fatal idiopathic hepatopathy. This study expands the number of viruses found in horses, and characterizes their genomes to assist future epidemiological studies of their transmission and potential association with various equine diseases. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV) was the first human Anelloviridae detected in a Japanese patient with an unknown type of hepatitis in 1997. TTV is by far the first known single-stranded circular DNA virus infecting human. In spite of its widespread nature in human population, its pathogenesis is still unclear. In addition, information regarding TTV infection in Iranian population is limited. Therefore, we attempted to determine the prevalence and genotype of TTV in three groups: HIV/HBV patients, chronic hepatitis B patients, and healthy individuals. Methods: The presence of TTV DNA in sera was investigated using PCR. The primer sets encompassing two 5΄-UTR and N22 regions were used, and the positive products were collected for sequencing. Phylogenetic tree was generated based on N22 region and using the MEGA 7 software. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 452 patients with HIV/HBV and chronic hepatitis B, as well as in healthy control groups. The results from PCR indicated positive rates for these three groups, 48%, 54%, and 49.3% using 5΄-UTR primer and 15.1%, 12%, and 8% using N22 primer, respectively. Conclusion: Five genogroups were observed, which the second group was found to be the most frequent. The results of 5΄-UTR primer showed more prevalence of TTV DNA comparing to N22 primer in patients and healthy control. © 2015, Pasteur Institute of Iran. All rights reserved.

AB  - Infection with Torque teno viruses (TTVs) is not restricted to humans. Different domestic and wild animal species are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs worldwide. Due to the global spread of the infection, it is likely that essentially all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and that co-evolution of TTVs with their hosts probably occurred. Although TTVs are potentially related to many diseases, the evidence of the widespread infection in healthy human and nonhuman hosts raised doubts about their pathogenic potential. Nonetheless, their role as superimposed agents of other diseases or as triggers for impairment of immune surveillance is currently under debate. The possible contribution of animal TT viruses to interspecies transmission and their role as zoonotic agents are currently topics of discussion. © 2015 Manzin et al.

AB  - Mosquitoes as one of the most common but important vectors have the potential to transmit or acquire a lot of viruses through biting, however viral flora in mosquitoes and its impact on mosquito-borne disease transmission has not been well investigated and evaluated. In this study, the metagenomic techniquehas been successfully employed in analyzing the abundance and diversity of viral community in three mosquito samples from Hubei, China. Among 92,304 reads produced through a run with 454 GS FLX system, 39% have high similarities with viral sequences belonging to identified bacterial, fungal, animal, plant and insect viruses, and 0.02% were classed into unidentified viral sequences, demonstrating high abundance and diversity of viruses in mosquitoes. Furthermore, two novel viruses in subfamily Densovirinae and family Dicistroviridae were identified, and six torque tenosus virus1 in family Anelloviridae, three porcine parvoviruses in subfamily Parvovirinae and a Culex tritaeniorhynchus rhabdovirus in Family Rhabdoviridae were preliminarily characterized. The viral metagenomic analysis offered us a deep insight into the viral population of mosquito which played an important role in viral initiative or passive transmission and evolution during the process. © 2015 Shi et al.

AB  - Torque teno felis virus (FcTTV) was detected in the cat population in the Czech Republic. A total of 110 serum samples were tested by a nested PCR technique using specific primers, situated in the highly conserved untranslated region of the virus genome. The frequency of feline TT virus in the Czech Republic was found to be 33.63%. Sequencing of PCR product from several virus strains showed that all of them are closely related and belong to the same virus species. Whole genome sequencing of three strains was performed to compare overall genetic heterogeneity of feline TT viruses. One of these three strains showed more that 10% difference at the nucleotide level. Furthermore we didn't find any correlation between FcTTV infection and sex or health status of examined animals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - New diseases in marine animals are emerging at an increasing rate, yet methodological limitations hinder characterization of viral infections. Viral metagenomics is an effective method for identifying novel viruses in diseased animals; however, determining virus pathogenesis remains a challenge. A novel anellovirus (Zalophus californianus anellovirus, ZcAV) was recently reported in the lungs of captive California sea lions involved in a mortality event. ZcAV was not detected by PCR in the blood of these animals, creating the inability to assess the prevalence of ZcAV in live sea lions. This study developed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect antibodies to ZcAV in sea lion serum. To assess ZcAV prevalence, paired serum and lung samples (n = 96) from wild sea lions that stranded along the California coast were tested through ELISA and PCR, respectively. Over 50% of the samples tested positive for ZcAV by ELISA (34%), PCR (29%), or both (11%) assays. ZcAV is prevalent in stranded wild sea lion populations and results suggest that PCR assays alone may grossly underestimate ZcAV exposure. This ELISA provides a tool for testing live sea lions for ZcAV exposure and is valuable for subsequent studies evaluating the potential pathogenicity of this anellovirus.

AB  - Various herpesviruses have been discovered in marine mammals and are associated with a wide spectrum of disease. In the present study we describe the detection and phylogenetic analysis of a novel gammaherpesvirus, tentatively called phocine herpesvirus 7 (PhHV-7), which was detected in samples collected during an outbreak of ulcerative gingivitis and glossitis from juvenile harbour seals (Phoca vitulina) at the Seal Rehabilitation and Research Centre, the Netherlands. The presence of this novel gammaherpesvirus was confirmed by viral metagenomics, while no other viruses other than four novel anelloviruses were detected. However, PhHV-7 DNA was also detected in harbour and grey seals (Halichoerus grypus) without gingivitis or glossitis. Genetic analysis of the partial polymerase gene of PhHV-7 detected in both species revealed limited sequence variation. Additional studies are needed to elucidate whether the viruses discovered played a role in the disease observed. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the gut virome at the onset of islet autoimmunity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Finnish Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) cohort. The stool virome in 19 case children, who turned islet autoantibody positive before the age of 2 years and later developed clinical type 1 diabetes, and 19 tightly matched control subjects was analyzed using NGS performed from stool samples collected 3, 6, and 9 months before the onset of islet autoimmunity. Human virus findings were verified using real-time PCR. RESULTS: One or more human viruses were present in 10.4% and bacteriophages were in 54% of the samples. The virome composition showed no association with islet autoimmunity. NGS was less sensitive and specific than real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest no dramatic changes in the gut virome shortly before the emergence of islet autoimmunity and emphasize the need of verification of mass sequencing results when viral exposure is assessed in association studies. © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Besides mosquitoes, ticks are regarded as the primary source of vector-borne infectious diseases. Indeed, a wide variety of severe infectious human diseases, including those involving viruses, are transmitted by ticks in many parts of the world. To date, there are no published reports on the use of next-generation sequencing for studying viral diversity in ticks or discovering new viruses in these arthropods from China. Here, Ion-torrent sequencing was used to investigate the presence of viruses in three Rhipicephalus spp. tick pools (NY-11, NY-13, and MM-13) collected from the Menglian district of Yunnan, China. The sequencing run resulted in 3,641,088, 3,106,733, and 3,871,851 reads in each tick pool after trimming. Reads and assembled contiguous sequences (contigs) were subject to basic local alignment search tool analysis against the GenBank database. Large numbers of reads and contigs related to known viral sequences corresponding to a broad range of viral families were identified. Some of the sequences originated from viruses that have not been described previously in ticks. Our findings will facilitate better understanding of the tick virome, and add to our current knowledge of disease-causing viruses in ticks living under natural conditions. © 2015 Xia et al.

AB  - Viral infections during the prenatal or early childhood periods are one of the environmental factors which might play an etiological role in psychoses. Several studies report higher antibody levels against viruses during pregnancy in blood of mothers of offspring with psychotic disorders, but the presence of such viruses has never been demonstrated.The goal of this study was to investigate the potential association between viral infections during pregnancy and progeny with psychotic disorders and, for this purpose, we performed a nested case-control study involving pregnant mothers of offspring with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with psychotic features (cases, N = 43) and pregnant women with healthy offspring (controls, N = 95). Since several potential viral candidates have been suggested in prior work, a broad-spectrum virus detection system was necessary.A metagenomic analysis performed with the virus discovery method VIDISCA-454 revealed only common blood-associated viruses in all cohorts. However, a significantly lower viral prevalence was detected in the group of cases and in the sub-population of pregnant mothers of offspring with schizophrenia (p < 0.05). Consistent with the existing inverse correlation between the level of these viruses and the immunocompetence of an individual, we hypothesized the presence of a higher immune activity during pregnancy in mothers whose offspring later develop a psychotic disorder as compared to controls.Combining our results with previously available literature data on antibody levels during the gestation period suggests that a more prominent maternal immune activity can be considered a risk factor for developing psychosis. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - AIM: Viruses from genus Anelloviridae (TTV, TTMDV and TTMV) are small DNA viruses that are widespread in human popu- lation. Data on tissue tropism, cell localization and morphometry of anelloviruses are scarce. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of TTV, TTMDV and TTMV in persons with liver disease and in healthy individuals, as well as electron-microscopic verification of Anelloviridae species.
METHODS: Detection of anelloviral DNA was performed in serum samples from 203 patients with liver diseases of various etiology and 115 voluntary blood donors using PCR with primers allowing to differentiate TTV, TTMDV TTMV based on the length of amplified fragment. Histopathological and electron microscopic studies were performed for liver biopsy specimens from 203 patients with liver disease.
RESULTS: High prevalence (70-90%) of all three anelloviruses in healthy individuals and patients with liver disease was demonstrated, with high frequency of triple TTV, TTMDV and TTMV infection (52.2-55.7%). Electron-microscopic study of liver biopsy specimens from TTMDV monoinfected patients gave a submicroscopic image of TTMDV virions with diameter 35.86 ± 2.04 nm. Electron microscopic studies confirmed the nature of liver damage in TTMDV monoinfection: accumulation of virus in the hepatocytes, significant cyropathy with enlightenment matrix of the cytoplasm and reduction of intracellula organelles involved in protein synthesis, portal and perivascular perisinusoidal fibrosis. TTV, TTMDV and TTMV virions were dentified in hepatocytes, confirming these viruses to be hepatotropic.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that anelloviruses are lymphotropic viruses, individual genotypes of those might be hepatotropic and pathogenic to liver.

AB  - Human torque teno viruses (TTVs) are new, emerging infectious agents, recently assigned to the family Anelloviridae. The first representative of the genus, torque teno virus (TTV), was discovered in 1997, followed by torque teno mini virus (TTMV) in 2000, and torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) in 2007. These viruses are characterized by an extremely high prevalence, with relatively uniform distribution worldwide and a high level of genomic heterogeneity, as well as an apparent pan-tropism at the host level. Although these viruses have a very high prevalence in the general population across the globe, neither their interaction with their hosts nor their direct involvement in the etiology of specific diseases are fully understood. Since their discovery, human anelloviruses, and especially TTV, have been suggested to be associated with various diseases, such as hepatitis, respiratory diseases, cancer, hematological and autoimmune disorders, with few arguments for their direct involvement. Recent studies have started to reveal interactions between TTVs and the host’s immune system, leading to new hypotheses for potential pathological mechanisms of these viruses. In this review article, we discuss the most important aspects and current status of human TTVs in order to guide future studies. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Heparin is one of the main pharmaceutical products manufactured from raw animal material. In order to describe the viral burden associated with this raw material, we performed high-throughput sequencing (HTS) on mucus samples destined for heparin manufacturing, which were collected from European pigs. We identified Circoviridae and Parvoviridae members as the most prevalent contaminating viruses, together with viruses from the Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Reoviridae, Caliciviridae, Adenoviridae, Birnaviridae, and Anelloviridae families. Putative new viral species were also identified. The load of several known or novel small non-enveloped viruses, which are particularly difficult to inactivate or eliminate during heparin processing, was quantified by qPCR. Analysis of the combined HTS and specific qPCR results will influence the refining and validation of inactivation procedures, as well as aiding in risk analysis of viral heparin contamination. © 2014 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.

AB  - Teno Torque virus, member of the family of Anelloviridae, has been associated with many autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. Its viral load tends to be higher in the bone marrow and in tissues with high turnover rate. We report here a case of an 11-month-old infant affected by acute myeloid leukemia who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and after 6 months had autoimmune hepatitis and atopic dermatitis. Extremely high-cytokine IP-10 and eotaxin levels were found in her sera, and serological tests and RT-PCR for viruses showed positive results exclusively for Teno Torque virus. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Background In Japanese Red Cross (JRC) blood centers, blood collected from donors with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of more than 60 U/L are disqualified even if serologically negative for transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). To assess potential risks of TTIs in plasma with elevated serum ALT levels in the current donor screening program of the JRC, we conducted a metagenomic analysis (MGA) of virome profiles in the plasma of blood donors with or without elevated serum ALT levels. Study Design and Methods Based on serum ALT levels, donors were classified into three groups: "high," more than 79 U/L; "middle," 61 to 79 U/L; and "low," less than 61 U/L. We individually analyzed 100 plasma samples from each group by MGA, employing shotgun sequencing. Viral sequences detected using MGA were partly confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Donors with high and middle ALT levels were significantly younger than those with low ALT levels, and more than 90% were males. Herpesviridae, Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae, and Flaviviridae sequences were identified in plasma samples, and their distribution and frequency were not significantly different among the three groups. Conclusion The serum ALT test may be unsuitable for monitoring for additional risks of TTIs in blood donors who were negative for typical TTIs using serologic and nucleic acid tests. Although MGA is less sensitive than PCR, it remains the best technology to detect known viruses in these donors. © 2015 AABB.

AB  - Although the infection of different animals and non-human primates with other members of Anelloviridae have already been reported there is no report about infection of animals with Torque teno midi virus/Small anellovirs (TTMDV/SAV). The aim of this study was to detect the virus in domestic village chickens. Blood samples were collected from 79 domestic village chickens in Isfahan. Blood samples of five adult laying hens and one cockerel were collected in three consecutive weeks (days 1, 8 and 14) as experimental chickens. Ten eggs were randomly collected from the eggs laid during days 12 to 17 and thin and thick egg whites and yolk samples were collected aseptically. After DNA extraction Nested-PCR was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers. In PCR, 431 bp and 441 bp products were detected. The detected bands were extracted and sequenced. Totally 26 out of 79 (32.9%) of the blood samples were positive for the virus. The frequency of the infection of the different parts of the eggs tested was 76%. For the first time TTMDV/SAV was detected in domestic village chickens which also vertically transmitted to eggs.

AB  - Although several studies suggest a virus or (endogenous) retrovirus involvement at the time of onset of schizophrenia, the unequivocal identification of one or more infectious agents, by means of an undirected catch-all technique, has never been conducted. In this study VIDISCA, a virus discovery method, was used in combination with Roche-454 high-throughput sequencing as a tool to determine the possible presence of viruses (known or unknown) in blood of first-onset drugs-naïve schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms. Two viruses (the Anellovirus Torque Teno virus and GB virus C) were detected. Both viruses are commonly found in healthy individuals and no clear link with disease was ever established. Viruses from the family Anelloviridae were also identified in the control population (4.8%). Besides, one patient sample was positive for human endogenous retroviruses type K (HML-2) RNA but no specific predominant strain was detected, instead 119 different variants were found. In conclusion, these findings indicate no evidence for viral or endogenous retroviral involvement in sera at the time of onset of schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - A small number of African green monkeys (AGMs) were introduced into the Caribbean from West Africa in the 1600s. To determine the impact of this population bottleneck on the AGM virome, we used metagenomics to compare the viral nucleic acids in the plasma of 43 wild AGMs from West Africa (Gambia) to those in 44 AGMs from the Caribbean (St. Kitts and Nevis). Three viruses were detected in the blood of Gambian primates: simian immunodeficiency virus (SIVagm; in 42% of animals), a novel simian pegivirus (SPgVagm; in 7% of animals), and numerous novel simian anelloviruses (in 100% of animals). Only anelloviruses were detected in the Caribbean AGMs with a prevalence and levels of viral genetic diversity similar to those in the Gambian animals. A host population bottleneck therefore resulted in the exclusion of adult-acquired SIV and pegivirus from the Caribbean AGMs. The successful importation of AGM anelloviruses into the Caribbean may be the result of their early transmission to infants, very high prevalence in African AGMs, and frequent coinfections with as many as 11 distinct variants. © 2015, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Anelloviruses are a group of single-stranded circular DNA viruses infecting several vertebrate species. Four species have been found to infect swine, namely Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) 1a and 1b (TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b; genus Iotatorquevirus), TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b (genus Kappatorquevirus). TTSuV infection in pigs is distributed worldwide, and is characterized by a persistent viremia. However, the real impact, if any, on the pig health is still under debate. In the present study, the impact of pig immunization on TTSuVk2a loads was evaluated. For this, three-week old conventional pigs were primed with DNA vaccines encoding the ORF2 gene and the ORF1-A, ORF1-B, and ORF1-C splicing variants and boosted with purified ORF1-A and ORF2 Escherichia coli proteins, while another group served as unvaccinated control animals, and the viral load dynamics during natural infection was observed. Immunization led to delayed onset of TTSuVk2a infection and at the end of the study when the animals were 15 weeks of age, a number of animals in the immunized group had cleared the TTSuVk2a viremia, which was not the case in the control group. This study demonstrated for the first time that TTSuV viremia can be controlled by a combined DNA and protein immunization, especially apparent two weeks after the first DNA immunization before seroconversion was observed. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind this and its impact for pig producers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Gastroenteritis is a clinical illness of humans and other animals that is characterized by vomiting and diarrhea and caused by a variety of pathogens, including viruses. An increasing number of viral species have been associated with gastroenteritis or have been found in stool samples as new molecular tools have been developed. In this work, a DNA microarray capable in theory of parallel detection of more than 100 viral species was developed and tested. Initial validation was done with 10 different virus species, and an additional 5 species were validated using clinical samples. Detection limits of 1 × 103 virus particles of Human adenovirus C (HAdV), Human astrovirus (HAstV), and group A Rotavirus (RV-A) were established. Furthermore, when exogenous RNA was added, the limit for RV-A detection decreased by one log. In a small group of clinical samples from children with gastroenteritis (n = 76), the microarray detected at least one viral species in 92% of the samples. Single infection was identified in 63 samples (83%), and coinfection with more than one virus was identified in 7 samples (9%). The most abundant virus species were RV-A (58%), followed by Anellovirus (15.8%), HAstV (6.6%), HAdV (5.3%), Norwalk virus (6.6%), Human enterovirus (HEV) (9.2%), Human parechovirus (1.3%), Sapporo virus (1.3%), and Human bocavirus (1.3%). To further test the specificity and sensitivity of the microarray, the results were verified by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) detection of 5 gastrointestinal viruses. The RT-PCR assay detected a virus in 59 samples (78%). The microarray showed good performance for detection of RV-A, HAstV, and calicivirus, while the sensitivity for HAdV and HEV was low. Furthermore, some discrepancies in detection of mixed infections were observed and were addressed by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) of the viruses involved. It was observed that differences in the amount of genetic material favored the detection of the most abundant virus. The microarray described in this work should help in understanding the etiology of gastroenteritis in humans and animals. Copyright © 2015, American Society for Microbiology. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Few studies have examined the lung virome in health and disease. Outcomes of lung transplantation are known to be influenced by several recognized respiratory viruses, but global understanding of the virome of the transplanted lung is incomplete. To define the DNA virome within the respiratory tract following lung transplantation we carried out metagenomic analysis of allograft bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and compared with healthy and HIV+ subjects. Viral concentrates were purified from BAL and analyzed by shotgun DNA sequencing. All of the BAL samples contained reads mapping to anelloviruses, with high proportions in lung transplant samples. Anellovirus populations in transplant recipients were complex, with multiple concurrent variants. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction quantification revealed that anellovirus sequences were 56-fold more abundant in BAL from lung transplant recipients compared with healthy controls or HIV+ subjects (p<0.0001). Anellovirus sequences were also more abundant in upper respiratory tract specimens from lung transplant recipients than controls (p=0.006). Comparison to metagenomic data on bacterial populations showed that high anellovirus loads correlated with dysbiotic bacterial communities in allograft BAL (p=0.008). Thus the respiratory tracts of lung transplant recipients contain high levels and complex populations of anelloviruses, warranting studies of anellovirus lung infection and transplant outcome. The authors analyze viral sequences in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from lung transplant recipients using shotgun metagenomics and quantitative PCR, revealing high levels and complex populations of anelloviruses within the lung allografts. © Copyright 2014 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.

AB  - We describe the metagenomics-derived feline enteric virome in the faeces of 25 cats from a single shelter in California. More than 90% of the recognizable viral reads were related to mammalian viruses and the rest to bacterial viruses. Eight viral families were detected: Astroviridae, Coronaviridae, Parvoviridae, Circoviridae, Herpesviridae, Anelloviridae, Caliciviridae and Picobirnaviridae. Six previously known viruses were also identified: feline coronavirus type 1, felid herpes 1, feline calicivirus, feline norovirus, feline panleukopenia virus and picobirnavirus. Novel species of astroviruses and bocaviruses, and the first genome of a cyclovirus in a feline were characterized. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region from four highly divergent partial viral genomes in the order Picornavirales were sequenced. The detection of such a diverse collection of viruses shed within a single shelter suggested that such animals experience robust viral exposures. This study increases our understanding of the viral diversity in cats, facilitating future evaluation of their pathogenic and zoonotic potentials. © 2014 The Authors.

AB  - Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses have genomes that are potentially capable of forming complex secondary structures through Watson-Crick base pairing between their constituent nucleotides. A few of the structural elements formed by such base pairings are, in fact, known to have important functions during the replication of many ssDNA viruses. Unknown, however, are (i) whether numerous additional ssDNA virus genomic structural elements predicted to exist by computational DNA folding methods actually exist and (ii) whether those structures that do exist have any biological relevance. We therefore computationally inferred lists of the most evolutionarily conserved structures within a diverse selection of animal- and plant-infecting ssDNA viruses drawn from the families Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae, Nanoviridae, and Geminiviridae and analyzed these for evidence of natural selection favoring the maintenance of these structures. While we find evidence that is consistent with purifying selection being stronger at nucleotide sites that are predicted to be base paired than at sites predicted to be unpaired, we also find strong associations between sites that are predicted to pair with one another and site pairs that are apparently coevolving in a complementary fashion. Collectively, these results indicate that natural selection actively preserves much of the pervasive secondary structure that is evident within eukaryote-infecting ssDNA virus genomes and, therefore, that much of this structure is biologically functional. Lastly, we provide examples of various highly conserved but completely uncharacterized structural elements that likely have important functions within some of the ssDNA virus genomes analyzed here. © 2014, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Microsatellites or Simple Sequence Repeats (SSRs) are tandem iterations of one to six base pairs, non-randomly distributed throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic genomes. Limited knowledge is available about distribution of microsatellites in single stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses, particularly vertebrate infecting viruses. We studied microsatellite distribution in 118 ssDNA virus genomes belonging to three families of vertebrate infecting viruses namely Circoviridae, Parvoviridae, and Anelloviridae, and found that microsatellites constitute an important component of these virus genomes. Mononucleotide repeats were predominant followed by dinucleotide and trinucleotide repeats. A strong positive relationship existed between number of mononucleotide repeats and genome size among all the three virus families. A similar relationship existed for the occurrence of DTTPH (di-, tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotide) repeats in the families Anelloviridae and Parvoviridae only. Relative abundance and relative density of mononucleotide repeats showed a strong positive relationship with genome size in Circoviridae and Parvoviridae. However, in the case of DTTPH repeats, these features showed a strong relationship with genome size in Circoviridae only. On the other hand, relative microsatellite abundance and relative density of mononucleotide repeats were negatively correlated with GC content (%) in Parvoviridae genomes. On the basis of available annotations, our analysis revealed maximum occurrence of mononucleotide as well as DTTPH repeats in the coding regions of these virus genomes. Interestingly, after normalizing the length of the coding and non-coding regions of each virus genome, we found relative density of microsatellites much higher in the non-coding regions. We understand that the present study will help in the better characterization of the stability, genome organization and evolution of these virus classes and may provide useful leads to decipher the etiopathogenesis of these viruses. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To investigate which microorganisms may be present in expressed prostate secretions (EPS) metagenomic sequencing (MGS) was applied to prostate secretion samples from five men with prostatitis and five matched control men as well as to combined expressed prostate secretion and urine from six patients with prostate cancer and six matched control men. The prostate secretion samples contained a variety of bacterial sequences, mostly belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum. The combined prostate secretion and urine samples were dominated by abundant presence of the JC polyomavirus, representing >20% of all detected metagenomic sequence reads. There were also other viruses detected, for example, human papillomavirus type 81. All combined prostate secretion and urine samples were also positive for Proteobacteria. In summary, MGS of expressed prostate secretion is informative for detecting a variety of bacteria and viruses, suggesting that a more large-scale use of MGS of prostate secretions may be useful in medical and epidemiological studies of prostate infections.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a large group of vertebrate-infecting small viruses with circular single-stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. In swine, two genetically distinct species, Torque teno sus virus 1a (TTSuV1a) and 1b (TTSuV1b) are currently grouped into the genus Iotatorquevirus. More recently, a novel Torque teno sus virus species, named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), has been included with Torque teno sus virus k2a (TTSuVk2a) into the genus Kappatorquevirus. In the present study, TTSuV1 (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b prevalence was evaluated in 721 serum samples of healthy pigs from Sardinian farms, insular Italy. This is the largest study to date on the presence of TTSuV in healthy pigs in Italy. The global prevalence of infection was 83.2% (600/721), being 62.3% (449/721), 60.6% (437/ 721), and 11.5% (83/721) the prevalence of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b, respectively. The rate of co-infection with two and/or three species was also calculated, and data show that co-infections were significantly more frequent than infections with single species, and that TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a double infection was the prevalent combination (35.4%). Quantitative results obtained using species-specific real time-qPCR evidenced the highest mean levels of viremia in the TTSuV1 subgroup, and the lowest in the TTSuVk2b subgroup. Interestingly, multiple infections with distinct TTSuV species seemed to significantly affect the DNA load and specifically, data highlighted that double infection with TTSuVk2a increased the viral titers of TTSuV1, likewise the co-infection with TTSuVk2b increased the titers of TTSuVk2a. © 2014 Blois et al.

AB  - Background: The Human Microbiome Project (HMP) was undertaken with the goal of defining microbial communities in and on the bodies of healthy individuals using high-throughput metagenomic sequencing analysis. The viruses present in these microbial communities, the 'human virome,' are an important aspect of the human microbiome that is particularly understudied in the absence of overt disease. We analyzed eukaryotic double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses, together with dsDNA replicative intermediates of single-stranded DNA viruses, in metagenomic sequence data generated by the HMP. We studied 706 samples from 102 subjects were studied, with each subject sampled at up to five major body habitats: nose, skin, mouth, vagina, and stool. Fifty-one individuals had samples taken at two or three time points 30 to 359 days apart from at least one of the body habitats. Results: We detected an average of 5.5 viral genera in each individual. At least one virus was detected in 92% of the individuals sampled. These viruses included herpesviruses, papillomaviruses, polyomaviruses, adenoviruses, anelloviruses, parvoviruses, and circoviruses. Each individual had a distinct viral profile, demonstrating the high interpersonal diversity of the virome. Some components of the virome were stable over time. Conclusions: This study is the first to use high-throughput DNA sequencing to describe the diversity of eukaryotic dsDNA viruses in a large cohort of normal individuals who were sampled at multiple body sites. Our results show that the human virome is a complex component of the microbial flora. Some viruses establish long-term infections that may be associated with increased risk or possibly with protection from disease. A better understanding of the composition and dynamics of the virome may hold important keys to human health. © 2014 Wylie et al.

AB  - Using random PCR in combination with next-generation sequencing, a novel parvovirus was detected in the brain of a young harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) with chronic non-suppurative meningo-encephalitis that was rehabilitated at the Seal Rehabilitation and Research Centre (SRRC) in the Netherlands. In addition, two novel viruses belonging to the family Anelloviridae were detected in the lungs of this animal. Phylogenetic analysis of the coding sequence of the novel parvovirus, tentatively called Seal parvovirus, indicated that this virus belonged to the genus Erythrovirus , to which human parvovirus B19 also belongs. Although no other seals with similar signs were rehabilitated in SRRC in recent years, a prevalence study of tissues of seals from the same area collected in the period 2008-2012 indicated that the Seal parvovirus has circulated in the harbor seal population at least since 2008. The presence of the Seal parvovirus in the brain was confirmed by real-time PCR and in vitro replication. Using in situ hybridization, we showed for the first time that a parvovirus of the genus Erythrovirus was present in the Virchow-Robin space and in cerebral parenchyma adjacent to the meninges. These findings showed that a parvovirus of the genus Erythrovirus can be involved in central nervous system infection and inflammation, as has also been suspected but not proven for human parvovirus B19 infection. © 2013 Bodewes et al.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a member of the recently created family Anelloviridae. Two distinct species of TTSuVs, 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) have been reported so far in domestic pigs and wild boars. Although TTSuVs have not been clearly linked to any specific disease of pigs, a relation between TTSuV infections and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) has been suggested. To examine further this possibility, the present study was conducted in search for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomes in tissues of PMWS and non-PMWS-affected animals. PMWS diagnosis was established by clinical signs, characteristic macroscopic and histopathologic lesions and the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 DNA. Samples of five different tissues (lungs, kidneys, livers, spleens, and lymph nodes) from PMWS-affected and non-PMWS-affected pigs were examined with two specific PCR assays developed to amplify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genome segments. TTSuV1 DNA was detected in tissues of non-diseased animals to significantly higher levels than in tissues of PMWS-affected pigs (p ≤ 0.001). Regarding TTSuV2, viral genomes were detected in nearly all samples from both PMWS-affected (94.7 %) and non-affected pigs (100 %), with no significant differences in the frequencies of detection of TTSuV2 genomes in both groups. No significant differences were detected on the distribution of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in the different tissues examined (p = 0.970). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV1-2), members of the newly established family Anelloviridae are considered non-pathogenic emerging viral agents of Suidae species. However, the genetic diversity, phylogeny and evolutionary processes responsible for the emergence and spread of TTSuVs in wild boars remain poorly understood. Here we implemented phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses to address key questions on the genetic diversity, evolutionary scenario and spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging TTSuVs in wild boars of the Western region (Transylvania) of Romania. High levels of genetic diversity of wild boar origin TTSuV1-2 have been found as well as a new TTSuV1 genotype and several new subtypes. Phylogenies suggest that several wild boar viral strains in both TTSuV species are likely to have emerged from a well-defined ancestor approximately 40 (TTSuV1) and 18 (TTSuV2) years ago and showed independent evolutionary trajectories. Bayesian phylogeography showed an intense flow of viral strains throughout the Transylvanian counties possibly related to wild host migrations, facilitating the rapid spread of TTSuVs. The intra-genotype and inter- and intrahost level recombination, intense spatio-temporal viral flow and the positively selected sites found in the ORF2 genes should be considered important driving forces shaping TTSuVs evolution. The first reported rates of nucleotide substitution for porcine anelloviruses, estimated to be 5.29-5.51×10-4subs site-1year-1, are in line with those measured previously for mammalian ssDNA viruses and RNA viruses. These high evolutionary rates of TTSuVs, independent of recombination, are reflections of adaptive evolution, an important factor in the emergence of novel viral variants which may explain their ability to emerge in Suidae hosts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ferrets are widely used as a small animal model for a number of viral infections, including influenza A virus and SARS coronavirus. To further analyze the microbiological status of ferrets, their fecal viral flora was studied using a metagenomics approach. Novel viruses from the families Picorna-, Papilloma-, and Anelloviridae as well as known viruses from the families Astro-, Corona-, Parvo-, and Hepeviridae were identified in different ferret cohorts. Ferret kobu- and hepatitis E virus were mainly present in human household ferrets, whereas coronaviruses were found both in household as well as farm ferrets. Our studies illuminate the viral diversity found in ferrets and provide tools to prescreen for newly identified viruses that potentially could influence disease outcome of experimental virus infections in ferrets. © 2013 Smits et al.

AB  - Objectives: Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) is classified as the Betatorquevirus genus of Anelloviridae. Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population. Methods: 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: Totally 62% of the tested samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster. Conclusion: The presence of the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Members of the family Anelloviridae are emerging circular DNA viruses infecting many species of vertebrates including pigs. To date, members of two distinct genera, Iotatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus 1a and torque teno sus virus 1b (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), and Kappatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus k2a and torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b), have been identified in domestic pigs and wild boars. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of these viruses based on 5' non-coding genes in Chinese swine herds experiencing clinical symptoms. One hundred eighty-five clinical samples from 11 different regions, collected during 2008-2009, were analyzed using a PCR method, and the results revealed a high TTSuV-positive rate of 78.9 % (146/185) in pigs. Moreover, we detected co-infection with multiple TTSuV strains in the same pig. Nucleotide sequencing results revealed greater genetic diversity within the genus Kappatorquevirus than within the genus Iotatorquevirus. In addition, TTSuVk2b, a novel virus discovered in New Zealand in 2012, was also identified in this study. In summary, the present work helps us obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTSuVs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Improvements and widespread use of nucleic acid amplification and sequencing methods have led to the recognition of new virus diversity in various domestic animals, including pigs. In this study we utilized either virus species specific or broadly reactive PCR assays to describe the occurrence and genetic diversity of selected DNA viruses belonging to families Adenoviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae and Parvoviridae in Cameroonian pigs. Fecal specimens were collected during spring of 2011. No adenoviruses, circoviruses and anelloviruses were detected, however, high prevalence and remarkable genetic diversity within the identified parvoviruses and, particularly, within bocaviruses was observed. PPV4 was the most prevalent virus (20%), followed by PBoV3 (18%), PBoV4 (18%), PBoV5 plus 6V/7V (16%), and PBoV1 plus PBoV2 (6%). The frequency of mixed infections with various combinations of these virus species reached 20%. Genetic analysis of the identified viruses showed that the capsid gene of PBoV1 and PBoV2 strains shared up to 91% and 94%. nt sequence similarities to reference PBoV1 and PBoV2 strains, respectively. The identified PBoV3 and PBoV4 strains shared ≤95% and ≤98%. nt identities with reference PBoV3 and PBoV4 strains, respectively, along the NS gene, whereas the PBoV5 strains shared 86%. nt identities with Hungarian and 87%. nt identities with Chinese PBoV5 strains along the capsid gene. In addition, a single PBoV5-like strain shared ≤71%. nt sequence identity with other PBoV5 strains. This is the first study to report evidence of the circulation of bocaviruses in Africa and contributes to our understanding of the impact of globalization on the dispersal of new and emerging viruses. © 2013.

AB  - Background: Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), infecting domestic swine and wild boar, is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. which has been classified into the genera Iotatorquevirus (TTSuV1) and Kappatorquevirus (TTSuV2) of the family Anelloviridae. A molecular study was conducted to detect evidence of a phylogenic relationship between these two porcine TTSuV genogroups from the sera of 244 infected pigs located in 21 subordinate prefectures and/or cities of Sichuan. Results: Both genogroups of TTSuV were detected in pig sera collected from all 21 regions examined. Of the 244 samples, virus from either genogroup was detected in 203 (83.2%), while 44 animals (18.0%) were co-infected with viruses of both genogroups. Moreover, TTSuV2 (186/244, 76.2%) was more prevalent than TTSuV1 (61/244, 25%). There was statistically significant difference between the prevalence of genogroups 1 infection alone (9.4%, 23/244) and 2 alone (64.8%, 158/244), and between the prevalence of genogroups 2 (76.2%, 186/244) and both genogroups co-infection (18.0%, 44/244). The untranslated region of the swine TTSuV genome was found to be an adequate molecular marker of the virus for detection and surveillance. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both genogroups 1 and 2 could be further divided into two subtypes, subtype a and b. TTSuV1 subtype b and the two TTSuV2 subtypes are more prevalent in Sichuan Province. Conclusions: Our study presents detailed geographical evidence of TTSuV infection in China. © 2013 Mei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The study describes a novel Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species, provisionally named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), originally found in commercial pig sera by applying the rollingcircle amplification technique. Full-length sequences of TTSuVk2b were obtained, annotated and used in the phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that TTSuVk2b is a novel Anellovirus species within the genus Kappatorquevirus of the family Anelloviridae. Quantitative PCR techniques were developed to determine total TTSuV DNA quantities as well as the prevalence and viral DNA quantities of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b. The mean total TTSuV load in seven commercial sera was determined at 6.3 log10 DNA copies ml-1 of serum, with TTSuVk2b loads being the lowest at 4.5 log10 DNA copies ml-1 of serum. Subsequently, prevalence and loads of TTSuVs were determined in pig sera from 17 countries. TTSuVk2b prevalence ranged from 0 to 100% with viral loads from 3.3 to 4.6 log10 copies ml-1 of sera. TTSuVk2a, so far the only species in the genus Kappatorquevirus, has been linked to an economically important swine disease, namely post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Considering the grouping of TTSuVk2b in the same genus as TTSuVk2a, TTSuVk2b prevalence and viral DNA load were determined in PMWS-affected animals and healthy counterparts. This revealed that TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b are not only genetically related, but also that their viral loads in serum are elevated in PMWS animals compared with those of healthy pen mates. In summary, the present work describes a novel TTSuV species including its genetic characterization, epidemiological assessment and potential disease association. © 2012 Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - The Anelloviridae family consists of non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. Three genera of anellovirus are known to infect humans, named TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV. Although anelloviruses were initially thought to cause non-A-G viral hepatitis, continued research has shown no definitive associations between anellovirus and human disease to date. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients 2-36 months of age. We determined that although anelloviruses were present in a large number of specimens from both febrile and afebrile patients, they were more prevalent in the plasma and nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. Using PCR to detect each of the three species of anellovirus that infect humans, we found that anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV were more prevalent in the plasma and NP specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. This was not the case for species TTMV which was found in similar percentages of febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of plasma and NP specimens containing anellovirus increased with age until patients were 19-24 months of age, after which the percentage of anellovirus positive patient specimens dropped. This trend was striking for TTV and TTMDV and very modest for TTMV in both plasma and NP specimens. Finally, as the temperature of febrile patients increased, so too did the frequency of TTV and TTMDV detection. Again, TTMV was equally present in both febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Taken together these data indicate that the human anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV are associated with fever in children, while the highly related human anellovirus TTMV has no association with fever. © 2012 McElvania TeKippe et al.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae includes human and animal torque teno viruses (TTVs) with extensive genetic diversity. The antigenic diversity among anelloviruses has never been assessed. Using torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) as a model, we describe here the first investigation of the antigenic relationships among different anelloviruses. Using a TTSuV genotype 1a (TTSuV1a) or TTSuV1b enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the respective putative ORF1 capsid antigen and TTSuV1-specific real-time PCR, the combined serological and virological profile of TTSuV1 infection in pigs was determined and compared with that of TTSuV2. TTSuV1 is likely not associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), because both the viral loads and antibody levels were not different between affected and unaffected pigs and because there was no synergistic effect of concurrent PCV2/TTSuV1 infections. We did observe a higher correlation of IgG antibody levels between anti-TTSuV1a and -TTSuV1b than between anti-TTSuV1a or -1b and anti-TTSuV2 antibodies in these sera, implying potential antigenic crossreactivity. To confirm this, rabbit antisera against the putative capsid proteins of TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b, or TTSuV2 were generated, and the antigenic relationships among these TTSuVs were analyzed by an ELISA and by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using PK-15 cells transfected with one of the three TTSuV ORF1 constructs. The results demonstrate antigenic crossreactivity between the two genotypes TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b but not between the two species TTSuV1a or -1b and TTSuV2. Furthermore, an anti-genogroup 1 human TTV antiserum did not react with any of the three TTSuV antigens. These results have important implications for an understanding of the diversity of anelloviruses as well as for the classification and vaccine development of TTSuVs. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Globalisation, in terms of the rapid and free movement of people, animals and food, has created a new paradigm, increasing the range and rate of distribution of many pathogens. In the present study, Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) have been used as a model to evaluate the effects of global trade on viral heterogeneity, and how the movement of live pigs can affect the distribution and composition of virus populations. Seventeen countries from different parts of the world have been screened for TTSuV1 and TTSuvV2. High levels of genetic diversity have been found as well as two new TTSuV subtypes. A small fraction of this diversity (<5%) was related with spatial structure; however the majority (>50%) was best explained by the exchange of live pigs among countries, pointing to the direct relationship between the movement of hosts and the diversity of their accompanying viruses. Taking TTSuVs as sentinels, this study revealed that the distribution and diversity of comensal microflora in live animals subjected to global trade is shaped by the commercial movements among countries. In the case of TTSuVs, it appears that commercial movements of animals are eroding the genetic composition of the virus populations that may have been present in pig herds since their domestication. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The newly established family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno viruses) and other animal species. The ones infecting domestic swine and wild boar are nowadays named Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV), which are small circular single-stranded DNA viruses highly prevalent in the pig population. So far, two genetically distinct TTSuV species are infecting swine. Both TTSuVs appear to efficiently spread by vertical and horizontal transmission routes; in fact, foetuses may be infected and the prevalence and viral loads increase by age of the animals. Detailed immunological studies on TTSuVs are still lacking, but it seems that there are no efficient immunological responses limiting viraemia. These viruses are currently receiving more attention due to the latest results on disease association. Torque teno sus viruses have been circulating unnoticed in pigs for a long time, and even considered non-pathogenic by themselves; there is increasing evidence that points to influence the development of some diseases or even affect their outcome. Such link has been mainly established with porcine circovirus diseases. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Background: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) are small, single-stranded circular DNA viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae family. Available studies clearly show that both viruses are widely distributed in the pig populations in America, Europe and Asia, although the impact of the infection is still unclear. Currently, the situation in domestic pig populations on the African continent is not known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible presence of the two viruses in domestic pigs in Uganda, and describe the phylogenetic relationships to those in the rest of the world. Results: Ninety-five serum samples from six districts in Uganda were used, and PCR using TTSuV1 and 2 specific primers for the UTR region was run for viral nucleic acid detection. The positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses performed in order to compare the Ugandan sequences with sequences from other parts of the world. The prevalence of TTSuV1 and 2 in the selected domestic pigs were estimated at 16.8% and 48.4% respectively, with co-infection found in 13.7%. The sequence identity was 90-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV1; and 63-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV2 sequences. Conclusion: This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV1 and 2 in domestic pigs in Uganda. These results highlight the importance of screening for emerging viruses given the globalisation of human activities. © 2011 Brink et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Torque teno midi virus and small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) are members of the genus Gammatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer after breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of infection by these viruses in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women from Isfahan, Iran. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from cervical cancers (n = 42) and cervicitis cases (n = 79) were subjected to nested PCR to identify TTMDV/SAV viral sequences. Of the 42 tumor cases, 22, 18 and 2 were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. In total, 23 (55%) of the tumor samples were positive for TTMDV/SAV. Of the 79 cervicitis cases, 38 (48%) were also positive for TTMDV/SAV. This is the first report of TTMDV/SAV in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Dengue virus is an emerging infectious agent that infects an estimated 50-100 million people annually worldwide, yet current diagnostic practices cannot detect an etiologic pathogen in ~40% of dengue-like illnesses. Metagenomic approaches to pathogen detection, such as viral microarrays and deep sequencing, are promising tools to address emerging and non-diagnosable disease challenges. In this study, we used the Virochip microarray and deep sequencing to characterize the spectrum of viruses present in human sera from 123 Nicaraguan patients presenting with dengue-like symptoms but testing negative for dengue virus. We utilized a barcoding strategy to simultaneously deep sequence multiple serum specimens, generating on average over 1 million reads per sample. We then implemented a stepwise bioinformatic filtering pipeline to remove the majority of human and low-quality sequences to improve the speed and accuracy of subsequent unbiased database searches. By deep sequencing, we were able to detect virus sequence in 37% (45/123) of previously negative cases. These included 13 cases with Human Herpesvirus 6 sequences. Other samples contained sequences with similarity to sequences from viruses in the Herpesviridae, Flaviviridae, Circoviridae, Anelloviridae, Asfarviridae, and Parvoviridae families. In some cases, the putative viral sequences were virtually identical to known viruses, and in others they diverged, suggesting that they may derive from novel viruses. These results demonstrate the utility of unbiased metagenomic approaches in the detection of known and divergent viruses in the study of tropical febrile illness. © 2012 Yozwiak et al.

AB  - A low level of CD4+ lymphocyte cells makes end-stage HIV/AIDS patients highly susceptible to microbial infections. We have adopted the next generation sequencing method to identify the spectrum of bacterial plasma and viral elements that might be present in these patients. The HIV/AIDS plasma microbiome was dominated by bacterial elements in the taxonomical order Pseudomonadales, while healthy people carried fewer bacterial DNA in the plasma. We have found that many of the bacterial elements in HIV/AIDS plasma are similar to those of the microbes found in the human gut, suggesting potential acquisition of microbial elements from the gut. The HIV/AIDS and normal plasma DNA virome shared some similarities in the presence of common ubiquitous eukaryotic viruses. The normal DNA virome was mainly composed of viruses from Anelloviridae. In contrast, the HIV/AIDS DNA virome contained a large proportion of bacteriophages, endogenous retroviruses and a non-human virus. In addition, several sequences, which might belong to novel bacteria or endogenous retroviruses, were identified. Taken together, the use of high-throughput sequencing technology in unveiling microbial metagenomics may facilitate future research in combating HIV/AIDS and its associated microbial complications. © 2011 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV), of the Anelloviridae family, Iotatorquevirus genus, is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, and negative sense DNA (ssDNA) virus infecting human and many domestic animals including swines. Very little information is known about the investigations of TTV prevalence in different swine breeds so far. Methods. In this study, 208 serum samples collected from seven swine breeds (Rongchang pig, Chenghua pig, Zibet pig, Wild boar, Duroc, Landrace, Large Yorkshire) from two independent farms were detected to determine the prevalence of two swine TTV genogroups, TTV1 and TTV 2, by nested polymerase chain reaction methods, and to analyse prevalence difference among these breeds. Results: The results showed that the prevalence of TTV in the seven breeds was 92%-100%. No significant difference (p > 0.05) in TTV infection was observed between different breeds. Interestingly, significantly higher prevalence for TTV1 in Rongchang boars (90%) and for TTV2 in Rongchang sows (95%) were detected, while co-infection rate (43.8%) was lower than other breeds. Sequence analysis showed that the homology of TTV1 and TTV2 were over 90.9% and 86.4% in these breeds, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicated that TTV was widely distributed in the seven swine breeds. The prevalence of both TTV genogroups associated with swine breeds and genders. This study also respented the first description of swine TTV prevalence in different swine breeds. It was vitally necessary to further study swine TTV pathogenicity. © 2011 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Current U.S. requirements for testing cell substrates used in production of human biological products for contamination with bovine and porcine viruses are U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) 9CFR tests for bovine serum or porcine trypsin. 9CFR requires testing of bovine serum for seven specific viruses in six families (immunofluorescence) and at least 2 additional families non-specifically (cytopathicity and hemadsorption). 9CFR testing of porcine trypsin is for porcine parvovirus. Recent contaminations suggest these tests may not be sufficient. Assay sensitivity was not the issue for these contaminations that were caused by viruses/virus families not represented in the 9CFR screen. A detailed literature search was undertaken to determine which viruses that infect cattle or swine or bovine or porcine cells in culture also have human host range [ability to infect humans or human cells in culture] and to predict their detection by the currently used 9CFR procedures. There are more viruses of potential risk to biological products manufactured using bovine or porcine raw materials than are likely to be detected by 9CFR testing procedures; even within families, not all members would necessarily be detected. Testing gaps and alternative methodologies should be evaluated to continue to ensure safe, high quality human biologicals. © 2011 The International Alliance for Biological Standardization.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are vertebrate infecting, small viruses with circular single stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. In pigs, two different TTV species have been described so far, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuVs have lately been linked to postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In the present study, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 prevalence and DNA loads in longitudinally collected serum samples of healthy and PMWS affected pigs from Spanish conventional, multi-site farms were analyzed. Serum samples were taken at 1, 3, 7, 11 and around 15 weeks of age (age of PMWS outbreak) and viral DNA loads determined by quantitative PCR. For both TTSuV species, percentage of viremic pigs increased progressively over time, with the highest prevalence in animals of about 15 weeks of age. TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral DNA loads in healthy and TTSuV1 loads in PMWS affected animals increased until 11 weeks of age declining afterwards. On the contrary, TTSuV2 DNA loads in PMWS affected pigs increased throughout the sampling period. It seems that TTSuV species differ in the in vivo infection dynamics in PMWS affected animals. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The study describes a novel rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay to detect members of the family Anelloviridae from swine and human serum samples. The RCA was carried out using short anellovirus (AV)-specific primers based on a highly conserved region among available AV full-length genomes. Then, RCA products were used as templates to amplify full-length genomes with an AV-specific PCR. Amplification products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and full-length genomes were isolated based on the known size. With this novel AV-RCA/PCR approach it was possible to detect Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) in swine and many species of Torque teno virus (TTV) in human sera, which were previously tested negative by conventional PCRs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno midi virus/small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the family Anelloviridae. It has a single-stranded, circular, negative-sense DNA genome. Its pathogenic role in human disease remains to be confirmed. In this study, viral shedding, molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTMDV/SAV were studied in human body fluids. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with acute respiratory disease were tested by PCR/nested PCR for TTMDV/SAV in two seasons (2005/2006, 2006/2007). Two years later, additional urine, stool, and serum samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from eight symptomless children for follow-up investigation. Forty-three (46. 7%) of the 92 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected contained TTMDV/SAV. High genetic diversity was observed; however, identical sequences were also detected in two patients. The mean age of the infected children was 3 years (1 months-8 years), and 58% of them were female. Co-infection with RSV was detected in 23% of the samples. In a follow-up study, nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum of six (75%), stool samples of four (50%) and urine samples of two (25%) of the eight children were anellovirus-positive. None of the anellovirus sequences were identical in the two collection periods, but identical sequences were detected in different body fluids collected at the same time from the same child. TTMDV/SAVs shedding was detected in four human body fluids. As a consequence, it is possible that generalized infection and fecal/uro-oral transmission of TTMDV/SAV occur. TTMDV/SAVs are frequently present in nasopharyngeal aspirates, although the variants may only be transient agents. Further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis and pathogenic role of TTMDV/SAV. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae comprises torque teno viruses (TTVs) diverse in genome structure and organization. The isolation of a large number of TTV genomes (TTV Heidelberg [TTV-HD]) of 26 TTV types is reported. Several isolates from the same type indicate sequence variation within open reading frame 1 (ORF1), resulting in considerably modified open reading frames. We demonstrate in vitro replication of 12 full-length genomes of TTV-HD in 293TT cells. Propagation of virus was achieved by several rounds of infections using supernatant and frozen whole cells of initially infected cells. Replication of virus was measured by PCR amplification and transcription analyses. Subgenomic molecules (μTTV), arising early during propagation and ranging in size from 401 to 913 bases, were cloned and characterized. Propagation of these μTTV in in vitro cultures was demonstrated in the absence of full-length genomes. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV, genus Alphatorquevirus, family Anelloviridae) is a DNA virus, highly prevalent in populations from around the world. TTV isolates have been classified into five main phylogenetic groups (1-5) showing a large genetic distance between them. The presence of TTV has been detected in feces. However, whether all five TTV genogroups are excreted in feces and the frequency of these events are presently unknown. The presence of TTV DNA was assessed in feces from 135 Brazilian (0-90 years old) patients with gastroenteritis by using three PCR methods, including real-time PCR. One hundred twenty one (91.1%) samples were positive with at least one method. Using a genogroup-specific assay, it was shown that all genogroups were present. Thirty-seven (27.4%), 27 (20.0%), 57 (42.2%), 29 (21.5%), and 33 (24.4%) fecal samples contained TTV isolates belonging to genogroups 1-5, respectively. Coinfections with two, three, four, and five TTV genogroups were found in 23 (17.0%), 15 (11.1%), 7 (5.2%), and 7 (5.2%) fecal samples, respectively. Thus, 52 (38.5%) samples contained more than one TTV genogroup. Viral loads ranged from 2.6 to 6.5 log genome equivalents per gram of feces. However, only moderate variations of viral load were noted depending on genogroup and number of coinfecting TTV genogroups. These results show a high prevalence and a diversity of TTV isolates in feces. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV) has a single-stranded circular DNA genome and is currently classified into a new genus Iotatorquevirus with two species in a newly established family Anelloviridae. Viral DNA of both porcine TTV species (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species has been documented in the United States and in Europe. However, the prevalence of specific TTSuV antibodies in pigs remains unknown. In this study, the putative ORF1 capsid protein from TTSuV2 isolate PTTV2c-VA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant ORF1 protein was used as the antigen for the development of Western blot and indirect ELISA to detect TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies in pig sera. The results revealed a relatively high rate of seropositivity to TTSuV2 in conventional pigs from different sources but not in gnotobiotic pigs. Overall, pigs with undetectable TTSuV2 viral load were more likely to have a lower anti-TTSuV2 antibody level. An analysis of 10 conventional pigs during a 2-month period showed that decreased viral loads or presumed virus clearance were associated with elevated anti-ORF1 IgG antibody levels. Interestingly, porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD)-affected pigs had a significantly lower level of TTSuV2 antibody than PCVAD-unaffected pigs (p< 0.01). This is the first study to establish essential serodiagnostic tools for investigation of TTSuV seroprevalence and infection dynamics, which will help elucidate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV infection in pigs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The innate immune system represents the first barrier a microbe has to meet in order to colonize and infect the host. Even in vertebrates, the adaptive immune system is polarized on the basis of what is sensed by the innate immune system. Viruses interact with cells of the innate immune system mainly via Toll-like receptors (TLRs): in particular, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in the genome of DNA viruses can bind TLR9 [Krug et al., 2001] in addition to KIR3DL2 [Sivori et al., 2010]. TLR-9 binding can have stimulatory or inhibitory effects according to the exact sequence of the CpG motif [Krieg, 2002], and the cumulative effect of stimulatory and inhibitory motifs within a genome has been called the "CpG index." Extending previous observations by other investigators [Hoelzer et al., 2008], we calculated the CpG index for many single- (Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae) and double-stranded (Poliomaviridae and Poxviridae) DNA viruses using genomes from the publicly available reference sequences (RefSeq) in Genbank. A spectrum of indexes ranging from positive (+3.8 for bocavirus) to negative (-6.653 for vaccinia virus) resulted (Table I). An attempt was made to group viruses according to their CpG index and we checked for common denominators in their clinical impact. DNA viruses with a high CpG index (e.g., adenovirus type 12 [Krieg et al., 1998], herpesviruses, TTV, parvovirus B19, and bocavirus) stimulate strongly innate immunity with a potential of leading to autoimmunity [Maggi and Bendinelli, 2009] and are subject to a strict immunosurveillance. When they are not cleared they usually become latent accompanied by methylation of CpG motifs [Winocour et al., 1965; Gunthert et al., 1976; Szyf et al., 1985; Badal et al., 2003], and increase in replication only during mild immunosuppression [Maggi et al., 2008], but are rarely directly pathogenic per se. DNA viruses with neutral CpG index (e.g., polyomavirus and parvovirus 4) are likely to become symbionts and make life-threatening damage only during heavy immunosuppression, either iatrogenic or disease associated. In contrast, DNA viruses with negative CpG indexes (e.g., adenovirus type 2 and 5 [Krieg et al., 1998], and poxviruses), by evading innate immunity, are subject to very poor immune surveillance and can replicate without control, resulting in life-threatening illness or chronic infection even in immunocompetent hosts. Of interest, vaccinia virus requires additional skin damage by scarification for inducing tissue inflammation in order to elicit protective immunity. It is suggested that a classification of DNA viruses according to their ability to stimulate the innate immune system is now feasible and clinically sound. Although this classification cannot make predictions on cell tropism, prevalence in the healthy population, or ability to be cleared effectively by the adaptive immune system, it may be useful for predicting the pathogenicity of emerging DNA viruses. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), a member of the family Anelloviridae, is a single-stranded, circular DNA virus, widely distributed in swine populations. Presently, two TTSuV genogroups are recognized: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuV genomes have been found in commercial vaccines for swine, enzyme preparations and other drugs containing components of porcine origin. However, no studies have been made looking for TTSuV in cell cultures. In the present study, a search for TTSuV genomes was carried out in cell culture lineages, in sera used as supplement for cell culture media as well as in trypsin used for cell disaggregation. DNA obtained from twenty-five cell lineages (ten from cultures in routine multiplication and fifteen from frozen ampoules), nine samples of sera used in cell culture media and five batches of trypsin were examined for the presence of TTSuV DNA. Fifteen cell lineages, originated from thirteen different species contained amplifiable TTSuV genomes, including an ampoule with a cell lineage frozen in 1985. Three cell lineages of swine origin were co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. One batch of trypsin contained two distinct TTSuV1 plus one TTSuV2 genome, suggesting that this might have been the source of contamination, as supported by phylogenetic analyses of sequenced amplicons. Samples of fetal bovine and calf sera used in cell culture media did not contain amplifiable TTSuV DNA. This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV as contaminants in cell lineages. In addition, detection of the viral genome in an ampoule frozen in 1985 provides evidence that TTSuV contamination is not a recent event. These findings highlight the risks of TTSuV contamination in cell cultures, what may be source for contamination of biological products or compromise results of studies involving in vitro multiplied cells. © 2011 Teixeira et al.

AB  - Ancient human remains are potential sources of biological information including traces of past infections, since previous studies have demonstrated the effective detection of several bacterial agents or host-integrated viruses in old biological remnants like tissues or teeth. Studies of skeletal dental pulp samples are of particular interest since this location is potentially exposed to bloodborne agents during life through its vascularization, and could be considered as well preserved from environment after death of the host. DNA viruses belonging to the family Anelloviridae are highly present in human populations where they harbor an extreme genetic diversity but a yet undefined implication in hosts' health. We hypothesized that anelloviruses would be detected in ancient remains and that they may also serve as tracer viruses for the study of other viral agents. We analyzed 200-year-old dental pulp samples from remains of soldiers of Napoleon's Great Army during the Russian Retreat. Successful detection of Anelloviridae DNA by PCR was obtained for 1/21 ancient samples tested. The sequence identified showed 23% nucleotide divergence with the closest group of modern isolates (genus Gammatorquevirus), and was confirmed as phylogenetically distinct from those identified in saliva samples from the two investigators in charge of the study (genera Alphatorquevirus and Betatorquevirus). PCR directed toward the human beta globin gene was also performed. Negative controls were negative. Our results demonstrate that an ubiquitary, non-integrated, DNA virus is detectable from ancient biological material, with potential developments in terms of evolution studies or subsequent molecular investigations involving further viral agents. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a circular single-stranded DNA genome, belonging to the family Anelloviridae. In swine, two genetically distinct species have been identified, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). The aim of the present work was to study the tissue distribution of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in pigs of different ages, including foetuses at the second and last thirds of gestation, and animals at 5 days and 5, 15 and 24 weeks of age. Investigated tissues included brain, lung, mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow. Viral DNA from tissue extractions were tested by a comparative PCR for the presence of TTSuVs. Overall, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 species were found in all tissues tested, with variations depending on age, and following similar infection dynamics in all tissues, increasing progressively in prevalence and virus load over time. The highest prevalence was found at 5 weeks of age and maintained afterwards, and the highest loads of virus in the different tissues were seen in the oldest animals (15 and 24 weeks of age). No animals were negative to TTV, including foetuses. In conclusion, the present study indicated that swine TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 can be found virtually in all body tissues of the pig. Both swine TTV species were present in high levels in almost all older animals, while viral negative tissues were only found in 5-week-old and 5-day-old pigs, and foetuses. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Since the identification of the prototype TTV in 1997, the diversity of members belonging to the family Anelloviridae identified in human and some animal species kept on increasing. At the same time, data regarding their natural history remain relatively limited. These viruses exhibit an extreme genetic diversity and a high prevalence in various populations, progressively demonstrated by the characterisation of full-length genomes and the optimisation of detection systems. Such unusual properties made the various studies intended to elucidate the implication of Anelloviridae in host's health difficult to develop, their biology being still poorly understood in absence of a robust culture system. These viruses have been identified in the blood and in multiple biological locations; they are probably remarkable examples of co-existence and co-evolution with their human and animal hosts.

AB  - This chapter examines the correlation between Torque teno virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with every one of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. This structure is distinct from those of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36-nt stretch near the replication origin of TA278 TTV possesses more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions does not exhibit a significant similarity. Nevertheless, the relative allocation of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNA (mRNAs) are generated by transcription in both of them. The structural protein with the replicase domain is coded for by frame 1 in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is coded for by frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is necessary for the replication of CAV. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. Considering these similarities and dissimilarities between CAV and TTV, it seems more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of genus Gyrovirus, into Anelloviridae together with TTV, or into a new independent family. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Current clinical studies on human annelloviruses infections are directed towards finding an associated disease. In this review we have emphasized the many similarities between human anellovirus and avian circoviruses and the cell and tissue types infected by these pathogens. We have done this in order to explore whether knowledge acquired from natural and experimental avian infections could reflect and be extrapolated to the less well-characterized human annellovirus infections. The knowledge gained from the avian system may provide suggestions for decoding the enigmatic human anellovirus infections, and finding the specific disease or diseases caused by these human anellovirus infections. Each additional parallelism between chicken anemia virus (CAV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) further strengthens this premise. As we have seen information from human infections can also be used to better understand avian infections as well. Increased attention must be focused on the "hidden" or unrecognized, seemingly asymptomatic effects of circovirus and anellovirus infections. Understanding the facilitating effect of these infections on disease progression caused by other pathogens may help to explain differences in outcome of complicated poultry and human diseases. The final course of a pathogenic infection is determined by variations in the state of health of the host before, during and after contact with a pathogen, in addition to the phenotype of the pathogen and host. The health burden of circoviridae and anellovirus infections may be underestimated, due to lack of awareness of the need to search past the predominant clinical effect of identified pathogens and look for modulation of cellular-based immunity caused by co-infecting circoviruses, and by analogy, human anneloviruses. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We report the isolation of 24 novel genotypes of TT viruses from a surgically removed spleen of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. The sequence analysis of our 24 isolates revealed the remarkable heterogeneity of TT virus isolates not only from the same patient but also from the same biopsy material. These isolates belong to four phylogenetic groups of TT viruses. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed five distinct genotypes (tth3, tth4, tth5, tth6, and tth7). The limited variation in sequence identity of the other isolates defines the latter as variants of four of these genotypes. A group of 6 isolates (the tth7 group) revealed a reorganization of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) leading to one larger and a varying number of smaller ORFs. The nucleotide difference of the full-length genomes was less than 1%. A variation of 69 to 97% in amino acids of a second group of 8 isolates (the tth3 group) was restricted to the hypervariable region of ORF1, indicating the existence of a quasi-species. These isolates differed by less than 2% in the remainder of their nucleotide sequences. An alignment of these isolates with 79 previously reported TT virus genotypes permits the proposal of TT virus genera and species within the family Anelloviridae in analogy to a previous proposal for the papillomaviruses (family Papillomaviridae).
