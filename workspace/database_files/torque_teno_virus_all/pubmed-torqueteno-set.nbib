AB  - Solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients receive immunosuppressive therapy to 
      avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. Immunosuppressive therapy increases the 
      risk of infections. However, no existing marker reliably reveals the status of the 
      immune function in SOT recipients. Torque-Teno virus or Transfusion-transmitted 
      virus (TTV) has gained attention as a possible endogenous marker of the immune 
      function. TTV is a non-enveloped, circular single strand DNA virus, and it may be 
      considered a part of the human virome. In a bidirectional relationship, the immune 
      system detects TTV and TTV may also modulate the activity of immune system. These 
      characteristics have made the virus a possible candidate indicator of immune 
      function. In this systematic review, we describe the role and potential function of 
      TTV viral load as an endogenous marker of the immune function and consequently the 
      level of immune suppression in SOT recipients.

TI  - Aseptic meningitis caused by torque teno virus in an infant: a case report.
PG  - 302
LID - 10.1186/s13256-019-2233-2 [doi]
LID - 302
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus-induced aseptic meningitis has not been documented, 
      although torque teno virus infections still remain under consideration for 
      etiological agents. This study identified a torque teno virus sequence using next 
      generation sequencing and immunoglobulin M response to the torque teno virus 
      antigen, therefore, that would be a comprehensive diagnosis for torque teno virus 
      infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 2-month-old Japanese boy was brought to our hospital 
      because he was irritable, drowsy, and lethargic. He was admitted based on his test 
      results which indicated the possibility of septic meningitis. He was started on 
      treatment with high-dose antibiotics and steroids. On the third day of 
      hospitalization, he became afebrile with improvement in his general status and was 
      discharged on the sixth day. He had no developmental problems for up to 1 year after 
      discharge. Metagenomic ribonucleic acid-Seq pathogen detection using next generation 
      sequencing of a sample of his cerebrospinal fluid, which was collected at admission, 
      revealed three short reads homologous to those in torque teno virus out of a total 
      of 1,708,516 reads. This finding indicated that our patient was positive compared to 
      the torque teno virus-negative cerebrospinal fluid samples (controls) from 13 other 
      patients. The torque teno virus has been shown to have a whole genome sequence of 
      2810 nt by polymerase chain reaction. We prepared a recombinant GP2 antigen from 
      torque teno virus and used it to study our patient's anti-torque teno virus immune 
      response. An anti-GP2 serum immunoglobulin M response was detected, providing 
      further supportive evidence of torque teno virus infection. CONCLUSIONS: This case 
      speculates that torque teno virus-induced aseptic meningitis has a good course. New 
      technologies like next generation sequencing can help in the identification of such 
      cases, and an accumulation of future cases is expected.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus is a small chronically persisting circular negative 
      ssDNA virus reaching near 100% prevalence. It is reported to be a marker for immune 
      function in immunocompromised patients. The possibility of vertical maternal-fetal 
      transmission remains controversial but incidence rate of TTV DNA in children 
      increased with age. TTV dynamics well studied for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation as a predictor of post-transplant complications but there is no 
      viral proliferation kinetics data for other patient groups or healthy individuals. 
      The aim of this study was to determine TTV dynamics during the first year of life of 
      healthy infants. METHODS: Ninety eight clinically healthy breastfeeding infants 
      (1-12 months of age) were analyzed by quantitative PCR for the whole blood TTV load 
      with the test sensitivity of about 1000 viral copies per milliliter of blood (total 
      number of samples including repeatedly tested infants was 109). RESULTS: 67% of all 
      analyzed samples were TTV-positive demonstrating significant positive correlation 
      between age and TTV load (r = 0.81, p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study 
      to suggest that viral load increases during the first year of life reaching a 
      plateau after 6 months with strong proliferation for the first 60 days. Our data 
      well correlates with TTV dynamics in patients following allogeneic hematopoietic 
      stem cell transplantation.

LID - 92
AB  - BACKGROUND: TTV has been detected in almost every human tissue type or body fluid 
      reaching near 100% prevalence. Several studies report mother-to-child postnatal 
      transmission of TTV in infancy but the risk of transplacental transmission of TTV is 
      still unclear. METHODS: The blood and plasma collected postpartum from 100 
      mother-child pairs were analyzed using TTV-specific qPCR. Samples were collected 
      from the peripheral vein of the mother and the umbilical cord. RESULTS: Eighty four 
      percent of pregnant women were TTV positive (median titers: 8 × 10(4) copies/mL; 
      range: 10(3) - 3 × 10(7)). The TTV load in plasma was approximately 100 times lower 
      than in whole blood. TTV was not detected in any of cord blood samples. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our data demonstrate the lack of transplacental transmission of TTV (or effective 
      prenatal inhibition of viral proliferation). The presence of the virus in infants 
      may be associated with mother-to-child transmission through breast feeding or other 
      routes of transmission.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus Is Associated With the State of Immune Suppression Early After 
      Liver Transplantation.
PG  - 302-310
LID - 10.1002/lt.25374 [doi]
AB  - The development of noninvasive biomarkers that reflect the state of 
      immunosuppression (IS) remains an unmet need in liver transplantation (LT). Torque 
      Teno virus (TTV) is a highly prevalent, nonpathogenic DNA virus whose plasma levels 
      may be associated with the immune status of the host. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the role of TTV as a biomarker of IS in LT recipients. TTV DNA in plasma was 
      quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction at different time points during 
      the first year after transplant in a prospectively followed cohort of 63 de novo LT 
      recipients, and any correlation between TTV DNA and biopsy-proven acute cellular 
      rejection (ACR) and opportunistic infections was then evaluated. In addition, TTV 
      DNA was studied in 10 longterm LT recipients in monotherapy with tacrolimus, 10 
      tolerant recipients, and 10 healthy controls. TTV was detected in the plasma of all 
      patients. Among the 63 LT recipients, 20 episodes of ACR were diagnosed, and there 
      were 28 opportunistic infections, 26 of them being cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. 
      TTV viremia was significantly lower during ACR (4.41 versus 5.95 log(10) copies/mL; 
      P = 0.002) and significantly higher during CMV infections (5.79 versus 6.59 log(10) 
      copies/mL; P = 0.009). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 
      TTV viral load for the diagnosis of moderate ACR was 0.869, with a sensitivity and 
      negative predictive value of 100%, respectively, for a cutoff point of 4.75 log(10) 
      copies/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in TTV DNA in either 
      longterm or tolerant patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, plasma TTV DNA 
      levels are associated with immune-related events after LT and could constitute a 
      potential biomarker of the state of IS during the first months after transplant.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Assessment of the intensity of immunosuppression in transplant 
      recipients to estimate the risk of rejection and infection is not entirely 
      satisfactory at the present time. Determination of Torque teno virus (TTV) viral 
      load appears to be a promising tool in this setting. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the 
      level of replication and kinetics of TTV during the first three months after kidney 
      transplantation compared to BK virus replication. RESULTS: In a retrospective cohort 
      of 116 renal transplant recipients, TTV viral load gradually increased during the 
      first three months post-transplantation with no significant difference or 
      discriminatory threshold between patients with and without BK virus replication. 
      However, the level of TTV replication appeared to be indirectly related to the risk 
      of BK virus replication, particularly according to the induction treatment used 
      (antithymocyte globulin: ATG or basiliximab). Among patients receiving ATG, those 
      receiving cyclosporine had significantly lower TTV viral loads (p < 0.01) with 
      threefold lower reactivation of BKPyV (13 vs 37%) 3 months post-transplantation. 
      Similarly, among the women in our cohort, TTV viral load was significantly higher in 
      women receiving ATG (6.58 ± 1.57 versus 4.62 ± 2.0 log(10) copies/mL for 
      basiliximab: p < 0.01), also with threefold higher BKPyV reactivation frequencies 
      (40 vs 13,3%). CONCLUSION: The multiparametric variation of TTV viral load does not 
      appear to be individually appropriate for the early detection or monitoring of 
      possible post-transplant BKPyV virus reactivation in renal transplant recipients.

TI  - Role of BK polyomavirus (BKV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) in liver transplant 
      recipients with renal impairment.
PG  - 1496-1508
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.000823 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Renal impairment is a common complication after liver transplantation (LT). 
      While BK polyomavirus (BKV) has been linked to renal failure in kidney transplant 
      recipients, Torque teno virus (TTV) is a surrogate marker for immunosuppression that 
      does not have a clear association with any human disease. The impact of BKV and TTV 
      on renal impairment after LT is unknown. METHODOLOGY: In this retrospective study, 
      urine and serum samples from 136 liver transplant recipients were screened for BKV 
      and TTV by quantitative PCR. In addition, serum was screened for BKV-specific 
      antibodies and the VP1 typing region was sequenced for BKV genotyping. All 
      parameters were correlated with clinical data.Results/Key findings. BK viruria was 
      detected up to 21 years after transplantation in 16.9 % of cases. BK viraemia was 
      detected in 8.7 % of patients with BK viruria up to 4 years after LT. BKV-specific 
      antibodies were detected in 93.6 % of all LT recipients and correlated with BKV 
      viral load in urine. There was no correlation between renal impairment and the 
      detection of BK DNA in urine (OR 0.983). TTV DNA was detected in 84.6 % of serum 
      samples and in 66.6 % of urine samples. The TTV viral load in serum correlated with 
      the BKV viral load but had no impact on renal impairment. CONCLUSION: Our data 
      indicate that the detection of BKV and TTV is not a risk factor for renal impairment 
      after LT. A correlation of TTV and BKV viral load seems to be an indicator for the 
      immune status of the host.

TI  - Genetic Analysis and Evolutionary Changes of the Torque teno sus Virus.
LID - 10.3390/ijms20122881 [doi]
LID - 2881
AB  - The torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is an emerging virus threating the Suidae species 
      of unclear pathogenicity, although it was previously reported as a worsening factor 
      of other porcine diseases, in particular, porcine circovirus associated disease 
      (PCVAD). Here, a comprehensive codon usage analysis of the open reading frame 1 
      (ORF1), which encodes the viral capsid protein, was undertaken for the first time to 
      reveal its evolutionary history. We revealed independent phylogenetic processes for 
      the two genera during TTSuV evolution, which was confirmed by principal component 
      analysis (PCA). A low codon usage bias was observed in different genera and 
      different species, with Kappatorquevirus a (TTSuVk2a) displaying the highest, which 
      was mainly driven by mutation pressure and natural selection, especially natural 
      selection. Overall, ATs were more abundant than GCs, along with more A-ended 
      synonymous codons in relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis. To further 
      confirm the role of natural selection and TTSuV adaptation to the Suidae species, 
      codon adaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and 
      similarity index (SiD) analyses were performed, which showed different adaptations 
      for different TTSuVs. Importantly, we identified a more dominant role of Sus scrofa 
      in the evolution of Iotatorquevirus (TTSuV1), with the highest CAI values and lowest 
      RCDI values compared to Sus scrofa domestica. However, in TTSuVk2, the roles of Sus 
      scrofa and Sus scrofa domestica were the same, regarding codon usage, with similar 
      CAI and RCDI values. Our study provides a new perspective of the evolution of TTSuV 
      and valuable information to develop control measures against TTSuV.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus Load-Inverse Association With Antibody-Mediated Rejection After 
      Kidney Transplantation.
PG  - 360-367
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000001455 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) represents one of the cardinal causes 
      of late allograft loss after kidney transplantation, and there is great need for 
      noninvasive tools improving early diagnosis of this rejection type. One promising 
      strategy might be the quantification of peripheral blood DNA levels of the highly 
      prevalent and apathogenic Torque Teno virus (TTV), which might mirror the overall 
      level of immunosuppression and thus help determine the risk of alloimmune response. 
      METHODS: To assess the association between TTV load in the peripheral blood and AMR, 
      715 kidney transplant recipients (median, 6.3 years posttransplantation) were 
      subjected to a systematical cross-sectional AMR screening and, in parallel, TTV 
      quantification. RESULTS: Eighty-six of these recipients had donor-specific 
      antibodies and underwent protocol biopsy, AMR-positive patients (n = 46) showed only 
      25% of the TTV levels measured in patients without AMR (P = 0.003). In a generalized 
      linear model, higher TTV levels were associated with a decreased risk for AMR after 
      adjustment for potential confounders (risk ratio 0.94 per TTV log level; 95% 
      confidence interval 0.90-0.99; P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Future studies will have to 
      clarify whether longitudinal assessment of TTV load might predict AMR risk and help 
      guide the type and intensity of immunosuppression to prevent antibody-mediated graft 
      injury.

TI  - Torque teno virus (TTV): current status.
PG  - 45-57
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified into the family Circoviridae, genus 
      Anellovirus, was first found in a patient with non-A-E hepatitis. TTV has a single 
      stranded circular DNA of approximately 3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, 
      spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) 
      with approximately 2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2- 
      and 2.6-kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are 
      frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs 
      could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture 
      system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in > 90% of adults worldwide but 
      no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys 
      need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate 
      the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a 
      higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer 
      and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory 
      diseases. TTV/TTMV-related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys 
      and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, 
      rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV 
      transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0-, 1.2- and 1.0-kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. 
      Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic 
      region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three 
      proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research 
      work.

TI  - Torque teno sus virus in pigs: an emerging pathogen?
PG  - 103-8
LID - 10.1111/j.1865-1682.2011.01289.x [doi]
AB  - The newly established family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting 
      humans (Torque teno viruses) and other animal species. The ones infecting domestic 
      swine and wild boar are nowadays named Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV), which are 
      small circular single-stranded DNA viruses highly prevalent in the pig population. 
      So far, two genetically distinct TTSuV species are infecting swine. Both TTSuVs 
      appear to efficiently spread by vertical and horizontal transmission routes; in 
      fact, foetuses may be infected and the prevalence and viral loads increase by age of 
      the animals. Detailed immunological studies on TTSuVs are still lacking, but it 
      seems that there are no efficient immunological responses limiting viraemia. These 
      viruses are currently receiving more attention due to the latest results on disease 
      association. Torque teno sus viruses have been circulating unnoticed in pigs for a 
      long time, and even considered non-pathogenic by themselves; there is increasing 
      evidence that points to influence the development of some diseases or even affect 
      their outcome. Such link has been mainly established with porcine circovirus 
      diseases.

PG  - 102-108
LID - 10.1159/000480507 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous virus that is commonly associated 
      with blood transfusion. The main aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence 
      of TTV in polytransfused children with thalassemia and to determine for the first 
      time the prevalent TTV genotypes in Egypt. METHODS: TTV was detected in 2 groups by 
      nested PCR: the first group comprised 200 children with thalassemia, and the second 
      included age- and sex-matched healthy children with no history of blood transfusion. 
      RESULTS: TTV was detected in 60 and 57%, respectively, of the children with 
      thalassemia and the healthy children. Among the TTV-positive children with 
      thalassemia, 71.6% were HCV positive. No hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in 
      the thalassemic children. Significant elevations of alanine transaminase and 
      aspartate transaminase were found in TTV-positive patients with thalassemia compared 
      to TTV-negative patients. Phylogenetic analysis of sequenced TTV isolates showed 
      close relationships to genotypes 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: TTV is highly prevalent among 
      children with thalassemia in Egypt, with a relatively high infection rate also 
      detected among healthy children.

TI  - Retrospective study of the relationship of Torque teno sus virus 1a and Torque teno 
      sus virus 1b with porcine circovirus associated disease.
PG  - 178-185
AB  - Genus Iotatorquevirus consists of 2 species, Torque teno sus virus 1a and Torque 
      teno sus virus 1b, which are ubiquitous in swine populations, and are widely 
      reported in association with porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD). To 
      evaluate the relationship with PCVAD, 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue 
      samples were used to detect both Iotatorquevirus species by nested PCR and 
      sequencing. Sixty-eight PCVAD cases were selected as well as 32 porcine circovirus 
      type 2 (PCV2) non-affected cases. Overall, 33 of the 100 cases were positive for 
      Torque teno sus virus 1a and 8 of 100 were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1b. 
      Only 24 of 68 (35%) PCVAD cases were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a; 39% 
      (9/23) of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, and 33% (15/45) of 
      PCV2-associated reproductive failure cases. Among PCV2 non-affected cases, 28% were 
      positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a and 6% were positive for Torque teno sus virus 
      1b. Torque teno sus virus 1b was not detected in PCV2-associated reproductive 
      failure cases. Regardless of the PCV2-status, a lower frequency of both 
      Iotatorquevirus species was found than depicted in other reports and there was no 
      statistical relationship with PCVAD (χ (2) < 0.01). Given the worldwide genomic 
      variability of Iotatorquevirus species, it is feasible that species prevalent in 
      Mexico share a lower nucleotide sequence identity, leading to different pathogenic 
      potential.

AB  - Plasma torque teno virus (TTV) DNA load directly correlates with the degree of 
      T-cell immune reconstitution early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation (allo-HSCT). Here, the kinetics of oral TTV DNA shedding was 
      examined to assess whether quantitation of TTV DNA load in saliva may either replace 
      or complement that in plasma for predicting lymphocyte (ALC) reconstitution after 
      engraftment. This prospective observational study enrolled 38 nonconsecutive 
      allo-HSCT recipients. Saliva and plasma specimens were collected at baseline 
      (pretransplant) and at around days +30, +50, and +90 after allo-HSCT. TTV DNA was 
      quantitated in both specimen types by real-time PCR. ALCs were measured by 
      cytometry. A total of 104 paired saliva and plasma specimens were available for TTV 
      PCR analyses. TTV DNA was detected more frequently in saliva than in plasma 
      specimens at all time points (overall, 94.2% vs 86.5%). Increasing levels of TTV DNA 
      were seen in both specimen types from day +30 to day +90 after transplantation. 
      Overall, TTV DNA loads were significantly higher in saliva than in plasma specimens 
      (P = .0002) and correlated significantly (P ≤ .0001). A direct correlation between 
      TTV DNA loads in saliva and plasma and ALCs was observed after engraftment (P = .034 
      and P = .002, respectively). Future studies should be aimed at determining whether 
      monitoring of oral TTV DNA shedding may be of any utility for inference of immune 
      reconstitution after allo-HSCT.

TI  - Surveillance and impact of occult hepatitis B virus, SEN virus, and torque teno 
      virus in Egyptian hemodialysis patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.

LID - S1201-9712(19)30484-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ijid.2019.12.011 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Egypt ranks first regarding the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      infection. Many patients have concomitant diseases like kidney disorders requiring 
      hemodialysis, a procedure carrying the hazard of transmitting other hepatitis 
      viruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate for occult hepatitis B virus 
      (HBV), SEN virus (SENV), and torque teno virus (TTV) among chronic HCV patients on 
      maintenance hemodialysis to identify their impacts. METHODS: A total of 325 
      hemodialysis patients were enrolled and divided into two groups based on HCV RNA 
      testing results. Blood samples were collected before hemodialysis. Sera were tested 
      for hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibodies 
      (anti-HBs) using ELISA. HBV, SENV, and TTV DNA were detected by PCR. The serum 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was measured. RESULTS: Anti-HBc and HBV DNA 
      were detected in 73.1% and 50.8% of group 1 versus 36.4% and 22.6% of group 2. The 
      serum ALT level was higher in group 1 than group 2. SENV was detected in 11.5% of 
      group 1 versus 8.2% of group 2. TTV was detected in 29% of group 1 versus 27% of 
      group 2. CONCLUSIONS: There is an increased prevalence of occult HBV in our locality 
      among chronic HCV patients undergoing hemodialysis. The existence of SENV and TTV 
      viremia has no clinical impact.

TI  - Torque teno virus infection in the pig and its potential role as a model of human 
      infection.
PG  - 163-8
LID - 10.1016/j.tvjl.2007.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs), of the genus Anellovirus, are single-stranded circular 
      DNA viruses that infect many vertebrate species. Although viruses of this type have 
      quite a stable genome, they exhibit low nucleotide homology. Torque teno virus 
      infection has not been consistently linked to specific diseases, although there is 
      epidemiological evidence of an association with disease in humans. The recent 
      recognition of naturally occurring TTV infection in swine and its epidemiological 
      resemblance to human TTV raises the possibility of using the pig as a model to study 
      human TTV infection. Such an approach will require the development of novel 
      investigative tools to study the epidemiology, transmission, immune responses and 
      potential pathogenesis of TTV infection. The present review summarises research on 
      animal TTV infection, focussing in particular on TTV infection in the pig, and 
      considers how a porcine experimental infection model might assist in the study of 
      human TTV infection.

TI  - Torque teno virus: an improved indicator for viral pathogens in drinking waters.
PG  - 112
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-5-112 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Currently applied indicator organism systems, such as coliforms, are not 
      fully protective of public health from enteric viruses in water sources. Waterborne 
      disease outbreaks have occurred in systems that tested negative for coliforms, and 
      positive coliform results do not necessarily correlate with viral risk. It is widely 
      recognized that bacterial indicators do not co-occur exclusively with infectious 
      viruses, nor do they respond in the same manner to environmental or engineered 
      stressors. Thus, a more appropriate indicator of health risks from infectious 
      enteric viruses is needed. PRESENTATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS: Torque teno virus is a 
      small, non-enveloped DNA virus that likely exhibits similar transport 
      characteristics to pathogenic enteric viruses. Torque teno virus is unique among 
      enteric viral pathogens in that it appears to be ubiquitous in humans, elicits 
      seemingly innocuous infections, and does not exhibit seasonal fluctuations or 
      epidemic spikes. Torque teno virus is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route 
      and can be assayed using rapid molecular techniques. We hypothesize that Torque teno 
      virus is a more appropriate indicator of viral pathogens in drinking waters than 
      currently used indicator systems based solely on bacteria. TESTING THE HYPOTHESIS: 
      To test the hypothesis, a multi-phased research approach is needed. First, a 
      reliable Torque teno virus assay must be developed. A rapid, sensitive, and specific 
      PCR method using established nested primer sets would be most appropriate for 
      routine monitoring of waters. Because PCR detects both infectious and inactivated 
      virus, an in vitro method to assess infectivity also is needed. The density and 
      occurrence of Torque teno virus in feces, wastewater, and source waters must be 
      established to define spatial and temporal stability of this potential indicator. 
      Finally, Torque teno virus behavior through drinking water treatment plants must be 
      determined with co-assessment of traditional indicators and enteric viral pathogens 
      to assess whether correlations exist. IMPLICATIONS OF THE HYPOTHESIS: If 
      substantiated, Torque teno virus could provide a completely new, reliable, and 
      efficient indicator system for viral pathogen risk. This indicator would have broad 
      application to drinking water utilities, watershed managers, and protection agencies 
      and would provide a better means to assess viral risk and protect public health.

TI  - Relationship of Torque teno virus to chicken anemia virus.
PG  - 117-30
AB  - This chapter examines the correlation between Torque teno virus (TTV) and chicken 
      anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with every 
      one of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. This structure 
      is distinct from those of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV and CAV are 
      different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is 
      enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36-nt stretch 
      near the replication origin of TA278 TTV possesses more than 80% similarity to that 
      of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions does not exhibit a significant 
      similarity. Nevertheless, the relative allocation of ORFs on each frame in these 
      viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNA (mRNAs) are generated by 
      transcription in both of them. The structural protein with the replicase domain is 
      coded for by frame 1 in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase 
      domain is coded for by frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis 
      in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is necessary for the 
      replication of CAV. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. 
      Considering these similarities and dissimilarities between CAV and TTV, it seems 
      more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of genus Gyrovirus, into Anelloviridae 
      together with TTV, or into a new independent family.

AB  - The torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently discovered DNA virus that has been 
      detected in many different hosts, including humans, livestock and poultry. To date, 
      there is no report of pigeon TTV (PTTV) from anywhere in the world. To investigate 
      the distribution of PTTV in pigeons from the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu and 
      characterize their genomes, we employed PCR to detect PTTV in 144 samples collected 
      from 6 pigeon plants in Jiangsu province, amplify complete genomes from 
      representative samples and analyze genetic characteristics using bioinformatics. The 
      results demonstrated that 71.5% (103/144) of samples were PTTV positive. The rate of 
      sequence homology among the six PTTV complete genomes obtained from Jiangsu province 
      ranged from 99.7% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that PTTV genomes had a 
      high degree of genetic similarity and were similar to chicken anemia virus that also 
      had poultry as a host. Although with the same host, PTTV shared distant relationship 
      with PiCV in both complete genome, Rep and Cap genes. The results of this study 
      provided evidence that PTTV could be detected in Chinese pigeons at a high level, 
      the evolutionary process of complete genome, Rep and Cap genes of Anelloviridae 
      family had obvious divergence.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV), member of Anelloviridae family, is considered a worldwide 
      distributed emergent virus and is currently classified into seven genogroups. 
      Interestingly, the pathogenicity of TTV remains unclear. However, it has been 
      constantly associated to hepatitis cases of unknown etiology (HUE) as well as 
      extensively studied in concurrent infections with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis 
      C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1). In South America, TTV 
      epidemiological data is scant, involving some studies from Brazil, Venezuela, 
      Colombia and Bolivia. The aim of this work was to investigate for the first time in 
      Uruguay the presence of TTV by a nested-PCR system in 85 human serum samples 
      infected with HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV-1 and in HUE cases. Overall, our results 
      reported a TTV infection rate of 79% (67/85). Furthermore, the molecular 
      characterization of Uruguayan strains revealed that one of them clustered in 
      genogroup 1, while the remaining ones formed separate clusters closely related to 
      genogroup 3, which should be confirmed by complete genome sequencing. Further 
      investigation about TTV circulation in Uruguayan population is needed in order to 
      provide additional information about the genetic variability and TTV epidemiology in 
      South America.

TI  - Molecular characterization of the ORF2 of Torque teno sus virus 1a and Torque teno 
      sus virus 1b detected in cases of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in 
      Mexico.
PG  - 1806-1815
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12956 [doi]
AB  - Worldwide Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV, genus Iotatorquevirus) species have been 
      regarded as possible agents associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease. 
      Iotatorquevirus species possess high genomic variability, suggesting that diverse 
      genotypes are widely geographically distributed. In this study, we validated the 
      genomic variability of Iotaroquevirus species in pigs with postweaned multisystemic 
      wasting syndrome. Genomic DNA from nine TTSuV1a-positive tissues and 15 
      TTSuV1b-positive tissues was used to amplify the complete ORF2 of each species by 
      nested PCR to perform a molecular characterization. It was found that Mexican 
      TTSuV1a sequences belong to genotype B, sharing phylogenetic origin, high nucleic 
      acid and amino acid sequence similarity and dominant epitope conformation with 
      commercially linked countries, such as the United States, Canada and China, whereas 
      the Mexican TTSuV1b sequences belong to genotype A, being more divergent among each 
      other and displaying low nucleotide identity with worldwide genotype A sequences. In 
      both Iotatorquevirus species, a PTPase-like signature motif was identified in the 
      predicted amino acid sequence, being more conserved for Mexican TTSuV1b sequences 
      than for Mexican TTSuV1a sequences, in which several substitutions were observed. 
      These changes may influence the conformation of dominant epitopes as different 
      arrays were determined among TTSuV1a genotypes. ORF2 variability may account for 
      pathogenic differences by modifying viral replication and immune response, as 
      depicted for human TTV.

AB  - Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 animals (473 murine rodents and 23 house shrews) 
      were captured in six regions of China. A total of 22.8% (113/496) of throat swabs, 
      29.1% (142/488) of fecal samples and 23.8% (54/227) of serum samples tested positive 
      for rodent torque teno virus 3 (RoTTV3). The positive rate in Rattus norvegicus was 
      higher than the rate in Rattus tanezumi and Rattus losea. Of 23 house shrews, one 
      throat swab and one serum sample were positive for RoTTV3. Ten murine rodents were 
      simultaneously positive for RoTTV3 in throat swab, fecal and serum samples. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 12 near-full length genomes of RoTTVs 
      sequences obtained in this study represented a novel RoTTV genotype (RoTTV3). In 
      conclusion, high prevalence rates of RoTTV3 were found in three common murine 
      rodents in China, and the RoTTV3 obtained in this study were classified as a novel 
      genotype of RoTTV.

TI  - Detection of Torque Teno Sus Virus in Pork Bile and Liver Sausages.
PG  - 283-288
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small DNA viruses widespread among humans and pigs. 
      The clinical significance of TTV infections in either humans or pigs is uncertain. 
      In fact, TTV viremia is highly prevalent in patients with different pathologies, but 
      it can also be frequently observed in healthy subjects. Virus infection in pigs is 
      considered a putative cofactor in several diseases; despite being detected 
      frequently in healthy animals, its role still remains unknown. The present study 
      aimed to investigate the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in 62 bile 
      samples collected from pigs at slaughterhouse and in 36 fresh pork liver sausages 
      bought at point of sale. Quantitative Real-Time PCR, confirmed that 19.4 and 58.3 % 
      of bile and sausage samples tested positive for TTSuV, respectively. The mean viral 
      load was established as 5.6 × 10(4) GE/µl for bile and 7.16 × 10(3) GE/g for 
      sausages. TTSuV nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed a wide heterogeneity among 
      the circulating TTSuV strains, which included both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2.

AB  - Patients who undergo dialysis treatment or a renal transplant have a high risk of 
      blood-borne viral infections, including the Torque teno virus (TTV). This study 
      identified the presence of TTV and its genome groups in blood samples from 118 
      patients in dialysis and 50 renal-transplant recipients. The research was conducted 
      in a hospital in the city of Maringá, state of Paraná. The viral DNA, obtained from 
      whole blood, was identified by using two nested Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR). 
      The frequencies of TTV were 17% and 36% in dialysis patients using the methodology 
      proposed by Nishizawa et al . (1997) and Devalle and Niel (2004) , respectively, and 
      10% and 54% among renal-transplant patients. There was no statistically significant 
      association between the frequency of the pathogen and the variables: gender, time in 
      dialysis, time since transplant, blood transfusions, and the concomitant presence of 
      hepatitis B, for either the dialysis patients or the renal-transplant recipients. 
      Among dialysis patients and renal-transplant recipients, genogroup 5 was predominant 
      (48% and 66% respectively), followed by genogroup 4 (37% and 48%) and genogroup 1 
      (23% and 25%). Genogroup 2 was present in both groups of patients. Some patients had 
      several genogroups, but 46% of the dialysis patients and 51% of the renal-transplant 
      recipients had only a single genogroup. This study showed a high prevalence of TTV 
      in dialysis patients and renal-transplant recipients.

TI  - Global impact of Torque teno virus infection in wild and domesticated animals.
PG  - 562-70
LID - 10.3855/jidc.6912 [doi]
AB  - Infection with Torque teno viruses (TTVs) is not restricted to humans. Different 
      domestic and wild animal species are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs 
      worldwide. Due to the global spread of the infection, it is likely that essentially 
      all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and that co-evolution 
      of TTVs with their hosts probably occurred. Although TTVs are potentially related to 
      many diseases, the evidence of the widespread infection in healthy human and 
      nonhuman hosts raised doubts about their pathogenic potential. Nonetheless, their 
      role as superimposed agents of other diseases or as triggers for impairment of 
      immune surveillance is currently under debate. The possible contribution of animal 
      TT viruses to interspecies transmission and their role as zoonotic agents are 
      currently topics of discussion.

TI  - Occurrence and molecular characterization of Torque teno virus (TTV) in a wastewater 
      treatment plant in Tehran.
PG  - 971-977
LID - 10.2166/wh.2019.137 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus which is predominantly 
      transmitted by the fecal-oral route and may be excreted in the absence of the 
      clinical symptoms. TTV was previously considered a probable cause of hepatitis, but 
      further studies could not strongly connect TTV to any serious health problem. TTV is 
      highly resistant to water and wastewater treatment processes and can be a useful 
      indicator for determining the fecal contamination of water. The purpose of the 
      present study was to assess the prevalence and molecular characterization of TTV in 
      treated wastewater in Tehran. Thirteen effluent samples were collected monthly from 
      the biggest wastewater treatment plant in Tehran, Iran (from September 2017 to 
      August 2018). The presence of the TTV was monitored in the samples by the nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The TTV genome was found in 76.9% of the 
      samples, and TTV of groups 1 and 3 were determined using phylogenetic analysis. 
      Therefore, treated wastewater can play a key role in the transmission of TTV and the 
      usage of treated wastewater as a source of potable water needs to be carefully 
      controlled.

AB  - Pigeon torque teno virus (PTTV), a recently discovered circular DNA virus. Here, we 
      developed a TaqMan-based real-time PCR for rapid and specific detection of PTTV 
      infections with sensitivity up to 49.3 copies/μl. Positive signals can be observed 
      by the assay in pigeon embryonated eggs, which indicted that PTTV can be transmitted 
      vertically. Our findings play important implications for a better understanding the 
      transmission of torque teno virus in pigeons.

TI  - Kinetics of Torque Teno Virus-DNA Plasma Load Predict Rejection in Lung Transplant 
      Recipients.
PG  - 815-822
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000002436 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option in end-stage lung 
      diseases; however, survival after transplantation is limited by acute and chronic 
      rejection or infectious events being results of inappropriate immunosuppression. 
      Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs) are ubiquitous DNA viruses in humans but not found to be 
      causative for any disease. However, some reports suggest that TTV-DNA levels reflect 
      the grade of immunosuppression with higher levels being found in more 
      immunosuppressed individuals. METHODS: We investigated the TTV-DNA levels in 34 lung 
      transplant recipients within their first year after transplantation by quantitative 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were extracted from charts. 
      RESULTS: In accordance with previous results TTV-DNA levels increase after lung 
      transplantation reaching a steady state after 3 months. The TTV-DNA levels were not 
      correlated with immunosuppressive trough levels and a selective increase was not 
      observed with other DNA viruses. In steady state TTV-DNA levels were significantly 
      higher in patients with infectious complications compared to the group of patients 
      without. Additionally, TTV-DNA levels decreased significantly before biopsy-proven 
      rejection. Sensitivity of a 10-fold decrease in TTV-DNA levels for a subsequent 
      rejection episode was 0.74 with a specificity of 0.99. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, 
      TTV-DNA might be used as an additional tool to monitor immunosuppression in lung 
      transplant recipients. Higher TTV-DNA levels reflect more intense immunosuppression, 
      whereas the TTV-DNA kinetic (ie, decrease of TTV-DNA levels) indicate rejection.

AB  - Anelloviruses are single-strand circular DNA viruses and ubiquitous within the human 
      population. Although there is no direct evidence, many studies have suggested the 
      anelloviruses may be associated with a variety of diseases. In this study, a novel 
      torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was detected in a child with unexplained encephalitis. 
      The detected virus had a circular genome of 2943 nt in length and 3 open reading 
      frames. It shared 45.4% - 35.9% nucleotide identities with known TTMV species and < 
      35% with the other species of anellovirus, which suggested it might belong to a new 
      species within the genus Betatorquevirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino 
      acid sequences of ORF1 showed that this virus represented a distinct branch within 
      the diversity of anellovirus. Whether this novel anellovirus strain is associated 
      with encephalitis requires further study.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is an unenveloped, circular, single stranded DNA virus with 
      a genome size of approximately 3.8 kb. Previous studies have demonstrated varying 
      grades of association between TTV DNA levels and immune deficiencies related to age, 
      chronic infections and cancer. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been related to 
      persistent viral infections such as HSV-1 and CMV, but it is not known whether TTV 
      viral load could serve as a functional biomarker of cellular immunity in this 
      setting. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether TTV 
      infection and viral load is related to AD status, CMV immunity, systemic 
      inflammation or HLA types connected to anti-viral immunity. A total of 50 AD 
      subjects and 51 non-demented controls were included in the study. AD subjects were 
      diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria and neuroradiologic findings 
      were consistent with the diagnosis. TTV viral load was analyzed in plasma samples 
      using a quantitative real-time PCR. Using a cut-off for TTV status at 200 copies/ml, 
      88% (89/101) of the study subjects were classified as TTV positive. TTV viral load 
      significantly increased with age (beta 0.049 per year, p<0.001) but significantly 
      decreased in relation to CMV IgG levels (beta -0.022 per 1000 units, p = 0.005) and 
      HLA-B27 positivity (beta -0.53, p = 0.023). In conclusion, TTV immune control is not 
      significantly affected by AD status, but appears related to age, CMV humoral immune 
      response and HLA type.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque Teno virus (TTV) plasma DNA load directly correlate with the 
      level of immunosuppresion in different clinical settings. It is uncertain whether 
      this may be the case in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients 
      (allo-HSCT). OBJECTIVES: We characterized the dynamics of TTV DNAemia in patients 
      undergoing T-cell replete allo-SCT. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective single-center 
      observational study including 72 allo-HSCT patients. Plasma TTV DNA loads were 
      quantified before initiating the conditioning regimen and at different time-points 
      after transplant by real-time PCR. White blood cells (WBC) and absolute lymphocyte 
      counts (ALC) were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: A dramatic drop in plasma TTV 
      DNA load was observed shortly after conditioning. The TTV DNA load increased 
      steadily after engraftment reaching its peak at day +90 after transplant. The 
      increase in TTV DNA load paralleled that of ALC, and was of greater magnitude in 
      patients who developed severe (grades II-IV) acute graft vs. host disease. 
      CONCLUSION: Repopulation of lymphocytes early after allo-HSCT correlates with an 
      increase of plasma TTV DNA load. Prospective studies are nevertheless needed to 
      determine whether the kinetics of TTV DNAemia may allow inference of the degree of 
      overall immunocompetence in these patients.

TI  - Dynamics of Torque Teno virus viremia could predict risk of complications after 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 355-362

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an established 
      treatment option for several hematological diseases. However, the first year 
      post-transplantation is often complicated by infections and graft-versus-host 
      disease (GVHD). Improvements in immunological monitoring could reduce such 
      post-transplant complications. Torque Teno virus (TTV), a chronically persisting DNA 
      virus, is reported to be a marker for immune function in immunocompromised patients. 
      In the present study, the TTV kinetics were analyzed to investigate the potential 
      role of TTV viremia as immune-competence read-out after allo-HSCT. Twenty-three 
      monocentric allo-HSCT recipients were retrospectively tested for TTV-DNA in whole 
      blood at given day post-transplant. Dynamics of TTV viremia was analyzed with 
      respect to episodes of non-TTV viral reactivations (CMV, EBV, and BKPyV), acute 
      GVHD, and recovery of immune cells. Recipients affected by persisting viral 
      infections and/or GVHD during the first 100 days after allo-HSCT showed a 
      significantly higher median TTV load at day +30 than patients with a less 
      complicated clinical course (p = 0.005). This was also associated with a total 
      lymphocyte count <5.5E+08 cells/L in this high-risk group (p = 0.039). These 
      findings suggest that TTV could represent an additional parameter to identify 
      patients at higher risk for complications in the first 100 days following allo-HSCT. 
      Prospective studies, including the monitoring of lymphocyte subsets, are required to 
      define the potential use of TTV in immunological monitoring after allo-HSCT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported that viral infections are related to lung 
      cancer. We previously reported the involvement of Torque teno virus (TTV) in 
      patients with lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of 
      TTV in lung cancer growth, and its influence on changes in TTV DNA titers due to 
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in lung cancer patients are poorly understood. 
      METHODS: Serum TTV DNA titers were measured in serum samples obtained from patients 
      with lung cancer. Forty-eight patients with primary lung cancer, including 8 
      patients with IPF, were enrolled. Serum TTV DNA titers were quantitated before and 
      after chemotherapy. In addition, patients were classified into two groups according 
      to the presence or absence of IPF, and clinical characteristics were compared 
      between these two groups. RESULTS: Among the 33 patients with partial response to 
      treatment or stable disease in the lung cancer, the mean TTV DNA titer in 28 
      patients without IPF had significantly decreased after chemotherapy. In contrast, 
      the mean TTV DNA titer in the 5 patients with IPF tended to increase after 
      chemotherapy. In the 15 patients with progressive lung cancer, TTV DNA titers were 
      significantly elevated in those with and without IPF. CONCLUSION: In lung cancer 
      patients without IPF, changes in TTV titers may be correlated with tumor growth. 
      However, in lung cancer patients with IPF, TTV titers were not consistently 
      associated with chemotherapy responses. Therefore, IPF may have an influence on 
      changes in TTV DNA titers.

AB  - In the present study, a total of 158 fecal samples were collected from diarrheal 
      dogs younger than 1 year old in pet clinic in China. 20 specimens (20/158, 13%) were 
      positive for Torque teno canis virus DNA using detection PCR. One representative 
      positive isolate designated LDL was randomly selected, cloned and sequenced. The 
      complete genome of the LDL Chinese strain was 2799 nucleotides in length and 
      contains three open reading frames (ORFs), which encode 576 (ORF1), 101 (ORF2), and 
      243 (ORF3) aa. Compared with the human and other animal TTV genomes, the genome of 
      the LDL strain is clearly smaller and shares 95% identity with Japanese cf-TTV10 
      strain (AB076002). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the present Chinese Torque teno 
      canis virus LDL strain was also closely clustered with the previous Japanese 
      cf-TTV10 strain, and formed a different branch together with Torque teno sus viruses 
      1 and 2 compared with other Torque teno viruses, Torque teno mini virus, and Torque 
      teno midi virus. Our study demonstrated that Torque teno canis virus is present in 
      China.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) distribution in healthy Russian population.
PG  - 134
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-6-134 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular, single-stranded DNA virus that 
      chronically infects healthy individuals of all ages worldwide. There is a lot of 
      data on the prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of TTV in healthy populations and 
      in patients with various diseases now available. However, little is known about TTV 
      load among healthy human population. In this study we analyzed TTV load in the group 
      of 512 Russian elite athletes, who are supposed to be, by some standards, the 
      healthiest part of the human population. RESULTS: The prevalence rate of TTV among 
      the Russian Olympic Reserve members was 94% (for test sensitivity about 1000 genome 
      equivalents per 1 ml of blood). Quantities varied from 103 (which corresponded to 
      detection limit) to 1010 copies per 1 ml of blood, with median at 2.7 x 106 copies. 
      CONCLUSION: About 94% of healthy individuals in Russian population have more than 
      1000 TTV genome copies per 1 ml of blood. This result exceeds the previously 
      published data, and can be explained by either more sensitive PCR test system or by 
      higher TTV distribution in Russian population or both. TTV viral load neither 
      depends on gender, nor age.

LID - e0149901
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus highly prevalent in the 
      world. It has been detected in eastern Taiwan indigenes with a low prevalence of 11% 
      by using N22 region of which known to underestimate TTV prevalence excessively. In 
      order to clarify their realistic epidemiology, we re-analyzed TTV prevalence with 
      UTR region. One hundred and forty serum samples from eastern Taiwanese indigenous 
      population were collected and TTV DNA was detected in 133 (95%) samples. Direct 
      sequencing revealed an extensive mix-infection of different TTV strains within the 
      infected individual. Entire TTV open reading frame 1 was amplified and cloned from a 
      TTV positive individual to distinguish mix-infected strains. Phylogenetic analysis 
      showed eleven isolates were clustered into a monophyletic group that is distinct 
      from all known groups. In addition, another our isolate was clustered with recently 
      described Hebei-1 strain and formed an independent clade. Based on the distribution 
      pattern of pairwise distances, both new clusters were placed at phylogenetic group 
      level, designed as the 6th and 7th phylogenetic group. In present study, we showed a 
      very high prevalence of TTV infection in eastern Taiwan indigenes and indentified 
      new phylogenetic groups from the infected individual. Both intra- and 
      inter-phylogenetic group mix-infections can be found from one healthy person. Our 
      study has further broadened the field of human TTVs and proposed a robust criterion 
      for classification of the major TTV phylogenetic groups.

PG  - 437-41
LID - 10.3109/00207454.2011.569039 [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of young adults which is characterized by 
      autoimmune demyelination of the central nervous system. Interaction of genetics and 
      environmental factors are required to cause MS. Among the proposed environmental 
      factors for MS, viral infections are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of 
      the disease. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV), which has recently been shown to infect 
      humans, is a member of circoviridae, and has a circular DNA with 2860 nucleotides. 
      Since there are a few data about the pathogenicity of this virus, this study sought 
      to investigate the presence of TTMV in sera from MS patients and healthy 
      individuals. We studied 149 serum samples from MS patients and 150 sera of healthy 
      individuals. Serum DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and was subjected to 
      nested polymerase chain reaction. TTMV-DNA was detected in 24 (16%) sera of the 
      healthy blood donors and in 21 (14.1%) samples of the MS patients, where the 
      difference did not reach significance (p > .05). The result of this study could not 
      establish an association between TTMV infection and MS.

TI  - Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in sows and suckling piglets.
PG  - 354-8
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.01.008 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that has been detected in 
      serum of primate and non-primate species including swine. Little information on 
      swine TTV infection and transmission dynamics is nowadays available. The goal of 
      this study was to gain insight into the potential role of the sow in transmitting 
      TTV to piglets and the infection dynamics of both swine TTV genogroups (TTV1 and 
      TTV2) during the lactation period. Serum samples from 44 sows at 1-week 
      post-farrowing and 215 piglets at 1 and 3 weeks of age were tested using TTV1 and 
      TTV2 PCR methods. Sow parity distribution and the number of delivered piglets 
      (liveborn, stillborn and mummified) per each studied sow were recorded. TTV1 was 
      detected in higher percentages than TTV2 in both sows (75% vs. 43%, respectively) 
      and piglets at 1 (17% vs. 7%, respectively) and 3 (32% vs. 12%, respectively) weeks 
      of age. TTV1 and TTV2 co-infections were observed in higher percentages in sows 
      (34%) than in piglets (2% and 4% at 1 and 3 weeks of age, respectively). Detection 
      of swine TTV genogroups in sows was not associated with their detection in piglets. 
      Moreover, there were piglets infected at 1 week of age with a swine TTV genogroup 
      different from the one detected in their dam. The number of sows delivering 
      stillborns and the mean number of stillborns per sow tended to be higher in the TTV2 
      infected sows; this value was significantly higher when co-infected sows (TTV1 and 
      TTV2) were compared with non-co-infected ones. Old parity sows had a higher 
      percentage of TTV1 infected 1-week-old piglets. Results of the present study showed 
      that the TTV infection occurs early in the production system and that these viruses 
      may be transmitted from sow-to-piglet but also from piglet-to-piglet in farrowing 
      facilities.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence of swine Torque teno 
      virus (TTV) in post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-affected and 
      non-affected Spanish swine. Nested PCR (nPCR) assays to detect two distinct TTV 
      genogroups were applied. A significantly higher prevalence of TTV infection was 
      found in sera from PMWS-affected animals (97 %) than in sera from non-PMWS-affected 
      animals (78 %). Whilst PMWS-affected pigs (91 %) were more likely to be infected 
      with TTV from genogroup 2 than non-PMWS-affected swine (72 %), no such difference 
      was observed with genogroup 1. Nucleotide sequences of nPCR products were 91-99 % 
      identical between strains within a genogroup. In contrast, inter-genogroup sequence 
      identities were 49-58 %. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that genogroups form 
      different clusters without association with PMWS or porcine circovirus type 2 
      infection status of the animals. These results indicate a high prevalence of both 
      swine TTV genogroups in Spain, being present more frequently in PMWS-affected 
      animals than in non-PMWS-affected animals.

AB  - A new species of torque teno mini virus, named TTMV-222, was detected in gingival 
      tissue from periodontitis patients using a viral metagenomics method. The 
      2803-nucleotide genome of TTMV-222 is closely related to TTMV1-CBD279, with 62.6% 
      overall nucleotide similarity. Genetic analyses of the new virus genome revealed a 
      classic genomic organization but a weak identity with known sequences. The 
      prevalence of TTMV-222 in the periodontitis group (n = 150) was significantly higher 
      than that in the healthy group (n = 150) (p = 0.032), suggesting that the new virus 
      may be associated with inflammation in chronic periodontitis patients. However, this 
      finding requires further investigation.

TI  - Global occurrence of Torque teno virus in water systems.

LID - 10.2166/wh.2015.254 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial indicator organisms are used globally to assess the microbiological safety 
      of waters. However, waterborne viral outbreaks have occurred in drinking water 
      systems despite negative bacterial results. Using viral markers may therefore 
      provide more accurate health risk assessment data. In this study, fecal, wastewater, 
      stormwater, surface water (fresh and salt), groundwater, and drinking water samples 
      were analyzed for the presence or concentration of traditional indicators, 
      innovative indicators and viral markers. Samples were obtained in the United States, 
      Italy, and Australia and results compared to those reported for studies conducted in 
      Asia and South America as well. Indicators included total coliforms, Escherichia 
      coli, enterococci, male-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages and microviradae. 
      Viral markers included adenovirus, polyomavirus, and a potential new surrogate, 
      Torque teno virus (TTV). TTV was more frequently found in wastewaters (38-100%) and 
      waters influenced by waste discharges (25%) than in surface waters used as drinking 
      water sources (5%). TTV was also specific to human rather than animal feces. While 
      TTV numbers were strongly correlated to other viral markers in wastewaters, 
      suggesting its utility as a fecal contamination marker, data limitations and TTV 
      presence in treated drinking waters demonstrates that additional research is needed 
      on this potential viral indicator.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and Torque teno 
      virus (TTV) infection in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in 
      chronic hepatitis C patients is still uncertain. AIM: The aim of the present study 
      was to investigate the prevalence and significance of OBI and TTV infection, and to 
      examine the genetic diversity of these viruses, in chronic hepatitis C patients with 
      and without HCC. METHODS: Sera from 151 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients 
      (49 patients with HCC and 102 without HCC) negative for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) 
      were tested for the presence of OBI and TTV infection by semi-nested and 
      group-specific multiplex PCR assays, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of HBV S 
      region was further performed. RESULTS: OBI and TTV infection were detected in 5 
      (3.3%) and 68 (45%) patients, respectively. HBV isolates were classified into 
      genotypes A (4/5, 80%) and D (1/5, 20%), and no HBsAg escape mutation was observed. 
      TTV phylogenetic group 3 was the most prevalent among both HCC and non-HCC patients. 
      OBI and TTV infection were significantly more frequent in patients with HCC than 
      patients without HCC (p=0.003, and p=0.009, respectively). Moreover, TTV infection 
      was associated with HCC (OR=2.23, 95%CI=1.04-4.80, p=0.040), independently of liver 
      cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: A low prevalence of OBI was observed in patients with 
      HCV-related chronic liver disease, and TTV infection was an independent factor 
      associated with the occurrence of HCC. Whether TTV influences the progression of 
      liver disease in chronic hepatitis C patients remains to be elucidated.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus: any pathological role in liver transplanted patients?
PG  - 972-9

AB  - Few studies have been performed on the prevalence of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) 
      infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients. The aim of this study was to assess 
      the prevalence, viremia and genogroup pattern of TTV among LT patients and to 
      ascertain whether TTV causes liver damage in liver transplanted patients with 
      biochemical and histological changes of unknown origin. Twenty-five patients were 
      evaluated before and after LT; 80 healthy subjects were considered as controls. 
      Serum samples were serially obtained from all the patients before LT and thereafter 
      at 3, 6 and 12 months post-transplant. Serum TTV-DNA and genogroups were assessed by 
      PCR. Patients underwent protocol serial liver biopsies at 6 and 12 months after LT. 
      Results were compared using the Chi-squared tests, McNemar's and Student's t-tests. 
      TTV-DNA was found in 25/25 patients before LT and in 60/80 blood donors (P < 0.01). 
      The TTV-DNA load increased significantly after LT (P < 0.001). TTV-DNA was 
      significantly higher in patients on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and azathioprine or 
      mycophenolate mofetil than in patients on CNI alone (P = 0.04) at 3 months after LT. 
      Genogroup analysis showed a significant increase in genogroup 5 positivity after LT. 
      No differences were seen in the viremia of patients compared according to their 
      viral versus other etiologies of their liver disease before transplantation. Viremia 
      and TTV genotype patterns did not correlate with the presence of 
      hypertransaminasemia or histological liver damage of unknown etiology. The 
      prevalence of TTV-DNA was significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than 
      in controls and the viral load was significantly higher after LT than beforehand. On 
      the basis of our data, TTV does not seem to cause liver damage following LT, 
      although larger studies with a long-term follow up are needed to confirm these 
      findings.

TI  - The kinetics of torque teno virus plasma DNA load shortly after engraftment predicts 
      the risk of high-level CMV DNAemia in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
      recipients.
PG  - 180-187
LID - 10.1038/bmt.2017.235 [doi]
AB  - Monitoring Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA load helps to estimate the risk of 
      opportunistic infections in solid organ transplant recipients. We investigated 
      whether the early kinetic pattern of plasma TTV DNA load after allogeneic 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) associates with subsequent CMV 
      and EBV DNAemia. This study included 71 allo-HSCT patients. We found that the area 
      under the curve (AUC) for log(10) TTV DNA loads quantified by days 20 and 30 after 
      transplantation (TTV DNA load AUC(20-30)), was significantly lower (P=0.036) in 
      patients who subsequently developed CMV DNAemia requiring preemptive antiviral 
      therapy (n=17) than in those who did not (n=8) or had no CMV DNAemia (n=19). 
      Patients displaying TTV DNA load AUC(20-30)⩽2.8 copies × days × mL(-1) were more 
      likely to have high-level CMV DNAemia. A trend towards a direct correlation between 
      TTV DNA AUC(20-30) and CMV-specific interferon-γ CD8+ T-cell counts by day +30 was 
      noted (P=0.095). However, this dynamic parameter was not useful for anticipating the 
      occurrence of either CMV recurrences (n=12) or EBV DNAemia (n=34). In summary, it 
      may be possible to identify a subset of allo-HSCT patients at a high risk of 
      developing high-level CMV DNAemia by analyzing the kinetics of plasma TTV DNA load 
      early after engraftment.

TI  - Immunobiology of the Torque teno viruses and other anelloviruses.
PG  - 65-90
AB  - Many features of the Torque teno virus and the other anelloviruses (AVs) that have 
      been identified after this virus was discovered in 1997 remain elusive. The 
      immunobiology of the AVs is no exception. However, evidence is progressively 
      accumulating that at least some AVs have an interesting interplay with cells and 
      soluble factors known to contribute to the homeostasis of innate and adaptive 
      immunity. Evidence is also accumulating that this interplay can have a significant 
      impact on how effectively an infected host can deal with superimposed infectious and 
      non-infectious noxae. This review article discusses the scanty information available 
      on these aspects and highlights the ones that would be more urgent to precisely 
      understand in order to get an adequate assessment of how important for human health 
      these extremely ubiquitous and pervasive viruses really are.

TI  - Torque teno virus: its prevalence and isotypes in North India.
PG  - 6044-51
AB  - AIM: To investigate the prevalence and genotype distribution of Torque teno virus 
      (TTV) in patients with different liver diseases and chronic renal failure treated at 
      a referral hospital in North India. METHODS: Whereas prevalence of TTV was based on 
      amplification of conserved region of ORF2 of TTV genome, the genotyping of TTV was 
      carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) procedure on the 
      N22 region of ORF1. RESULTS: TTV-DNA was detected in 137 of 513 (26.7%) patients 
      with liver diseases and 38 of 65 (58.5%) patients with chronic renal failure. TTV 
      was also detected in 27% of healthy controls. The sequence analysis of the PCR 
      product from 10 randomly selected cases failed to show a significant sequence 
      divergence when compared with that of the TRM1 isolate of TTV genotype 1. The 
      results of genotyping in 55 randomly selected patients showed the presence of 
      genotype 1 (G1) in 53 (96.4%) and genotype 2 (G2) in 2 cases (3.6%), respectively. 
      Other genotypes were not identified in this patient subgroup, suggesting that G1 is 
      predominant in this area. The results of genotyping by RFLP were also supported by 
      phylogenetic tree analysis, where G1 was found to be the major genotype. CONCLUSION: 
      These results indicate that TTV is moderately present in Indian patients, with G1 to 
      be the major genotype in North India. The pathogenicity and etiological role of TTV 
      in different diseases is still a question mark and warrant further studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although human torque teno viruses (TTVs) were first discovered in 1997, 
      still many associated aspects are not clarified yet. The viruses reveal a remarkable 
      heterogeneity and it is possible that some genotypes are more pathogenic than 
      others. The identification of all genotypes is essential to confirm previous 
      pathogenicity data, and an unbiased search for novel viruses is needed to identify 
      TTVs that might be related to disease. METHOD: The virus discovery technique 
      VIDISCA-454 was used to screen serum of 55 HIV-1 positive injecting drug users, from 
      the Amsterdam Cohort Studies, in search for novel blood-blood transmittable viruses 
      which are undetectable via normal diagnostics or panvirus-primer PCRs. RESULTS: A 
      novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was identified in two patients and the sequence 
      of the full genomes were determined. The virus is significantly different from the 
      known TTMVs (< 40% amino acid identity in ORF1), yet it contains conserved 
      characteristics that are also present in other TTMVs. The virus is chronically 
      present in both patients, and these patients both suffered from a pneumococcal 
      pneumonia during follow up and had extremely low B-cells counts. CONCLUSION: We 
      describe a novel TTMV which we tentatively named TTMV-13. Further research is needed 
      to address the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this novel virus.

TI  - Construction and biological activity of a full-length molecular clone of human 
      Torque teno virus (TTV) genotype 6.
PG  - 4719-30
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped human virus with a circular 
      negative-sense (approximately 3800 nucleotides) ssDNA genome. TTV resembles in 
      genome organization the chicken anemia virus, the animal pathogen of the 
      Circoviridae family, and is currently classified as a member of a new, floating 
      genus, Anellovirus. Molecular and cell biological research on TTV has been 
      restricted by the lack of permissive cell lines and functional, 
      replication-competent plasmid clones. In order to examine the key biological 
      activities (i.e. RNA transcription and DNA replication) of this still poorly 
      characterized ssDNA virus, we cloned the full-length genome of TTV genotype 6 and 
      transfected it into cells of several types. TTV mRNA transcription was detected by 
      RT-PCR in all the cell types: KU812Ep6, Cos-1, 293, 293T, Chang liver, Huh7 and 
      UT7/Epo-S1. Replicating TTV DNA was detected in the latter five cell types by a 
      DpnI-based restriction enzyme method coupled with Southern analysis, a novel 
      approach to assess TTV DNA replication. The replicating full-length clone, the cell 
      lines found to support TTV replication, and the methods presented here will 
      facilitate the elucidation of the molecular biology and the life cycle of this 
      recently identified human virus.

PG  - 1077-83
LID - 10.1007/s11255-009-9648-4 [doi]
AB  - This study describes the prevalence and association of Torque teno virus (TTV) 
      infection with blood-transmitted viral hepatitis including hepatitis B virus (HBV) 
      and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) 
      on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). TTV infection was diagnosed by detection of 
      TTV-DNA in serum, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TTV-DNA was 
      estimated in a total number of one hundred patients with CRF and in 100 voluntary 
      blood donors as controls. The markers of HBV and HCV were also tested in sera 
      samples of these patients. TTV-DNA was detected in 39 of 100 patients (39%) with CRF 
      and in 27 of 100 (27%) healthy controls. The analysis of the results demonstrated 
      HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and HCV core antigen in 5.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 4.0% of 
      patients, respectively. This study could not show any association of TTV with HBV 
      and HCV infections for the transmission pattern or any impact on severity of 
      diseases caused by these viruses in CRF patients. TTV also could not show any 
      association with demographic characteristics of patients, duration of dialysis, 
      number of blood transfusions and renal/liver function of the patients. As such, this 
      study concludes that TTV appears as a benign pathogen, showing no sign of 
      renal/liver damage or any change in the severity of diseases caused by blood-borne 
      hepatitis viruses.

      Using the N22 Expression Product from TTV Genotype 2.
PG  - 207-216
LID - 10.1159/000487481 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This study describes an immunoassay to detect anti-torque teno virus (TTV) 
      antibodies using a peptide obtained from expression of the N22 region of TTV 
      genotype 2. METHODS: The N22 region (∼500 bp) of TTV genotype 2 was cloned in a 
      pET-28a(+) vector and expressed in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium. Following metal 
      affinity chromatography, a purified polypeptide was used as an antigen for the 
      development of an immunoassay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in human sera. RESULTS: 
      Recombinant protein (∼25-kDa) was obtained after 24 h of incubation at 25°C in 
      ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium. A blot assay developed using this polypeptide as an 
      antigen and TTV-positive sera as the primary antibody produced a distinct spot on 
      the nitrocellulose membrane. Serum samples from 36 of 42 patients with renal disease 
      and 29 of 48 patients with liver diseases produced a positive signal using this 
      immunoassay. Simultaneously, 18 of 48 healthy controls were also detected to be 
      positive for anti-TTV antibodies. These results were found to be comparable with TTV 
      detection using PCR, and the assay showed a high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., 
      97.44 and 91.67%, respectively). Moreover, this assay could detect TTV infection 
      irrespectively of the genotype, including cases of mixed infection. CONCLUSION: The 
      present immunoassay using the N22 expression product may be used as an alternative 
      to PCR to detect TTV infection in large populations.

TI  - Torque teno virus (TTV) in multiple sclerosis patients with different patterns of 
      disease.
PG  - 2176-83
LID - 10.1002/jmv.23707 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is highly prevalent in the general population worldwide. The 
      relationship that TTV establishes with the central nervous system (CNS) of infected 
      hosts is not clear but it is suspected that TTV infection of the CNS lead to 
      increased local expression of inflammatory mediators that may play a role in the 
      pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The prevalence and load of TTV in serum and 
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 207 MS patients and 93 age- and sex-matched healthy 
      controls by qPCR designed on the untranslated region were analyzed. TTV DNA was not 
      detected in CSF, TTV prevalence in serum was similar in MS patients (76.8%) compared 
      to healthy controls (76.3%). Sub analyses performed in MS patients stratified on the 
      basis of clinical phenotypes indicated that TTV viremia was significantly lower in 
      individuals with relapsing remitting compared to chronic progressive disease. 
      Notably, viremia was increased in primary progressive, compared to secondary 
      progressive MS patients, and in relapsing remitting MS patients during quiescent 
      compared to relapsing phases of disease. Since TTV interacts with toll-like receptor 
      (TLR) stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines, TLR9 expression were 
      examined, showing that it was augmented on monocytes of chronic progressive MS 
      patients, in whom higher TTV viremia was present, but this did not correlate with a 
      distinct pattern of cytokine production. Overall these findings suggest that, 
      although TTV infects the same proportion of MS patients and healthy controls, the 
      levels of replication of the virus differ among patients, being correlated with the 
      clinical phenotype of disease.

TI  - High prevalence of torque teno sus virus in China and genetic diversity of the 5' 
      non-coding region.
PG  - 1567-73

AB  - Members of the family Anelloviridae are emerging circular DNA viruses infecting many 
      species of vertebrates including pigs. To date, members of two distinct genera, 
      Iotatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus 1a and torque teno sus virus 1b 
      (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), and Kappatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus k2a and 
      torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b), have been identified in domestic 
      pigs and wild boars. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and 
      genetic diversity of these viruses based on 5' non-coding genes in Chinese swine 
      herds experiencing clinical symptoms. One hundred eighty-five clinical samples from 
      11 different regions, collected during 2008-2009, were analyzed using a PCR method, 
      and the results revealed a high TTSuV-positive rate of 78.9 % (146/185) in pigs. 
      Moreover, we detected co-infection with multiple TTSuV strains in the same pig. 
      Nucleotide sequencing results revealed greater genetic diversity within the genus 
      Kappatorquevirus than within the genus Iotatorquevirus. In addition, TTSuVk2b, a 
      novel virus discovered in New Zealand in 2012, was also identified in this study. In 
      summary, the present work helps us obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology and 
      genetic diversity of TTSuVs.

TI  - Torque teno virus in fecal samples of patients with gastroenteritis: prevalence, 
      genogroups distribution, and viral load.
PG  - 1107-11
LID - 10.1002/jmv.22024 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV, genus Alphatorquevirus, family Anelloviridae) is a DNA 
      virus, highly prevalent in populations from around the world. TTV isolates have been 
      classified into five main phylogenetic groups (1-5) showing a large genetic distance 
      between them. The presence of TTV has been detected in feces. However, whether all 
      five TTV genogroups are excreted in feces and the frequency of these events are 
      presently unknown. The presence of TTV DNA was assessed in feces from 135 Brazilian 
      (0-90 years old) patients with gastroenteritis by using three PCR methods, including 
      real-time PCR. One hundred twenty one (91.1%) samples were positive with at least 
      one method. Using a genogroup-specific assay, it was shown that all genogroups were 
      present. Thirty-seven (27.4%), 27 (20.0%), 57 (42.2%), 29 (21.5%), and 33 (24.4%) 
      fecal samples contained TTV isolates belonging to genogroups 1-5, respectively. 
      Coinfections with two, three, four, and five TTV genogroups were found in 23 
      (17.0%), 15 (11.1%), 7 (5.2%), and 7 (5.2%) fecal samples, respectively. Thus, 52 
      (38.5%) samples contained more than one TTV genogroup. Viral loads ranged from 2.6 
      to 6.5 log genome equivalents per gram of feces. However, only moderate variations 
      of viral load were noted depending on genogroup and number of coinfecting TTV 
      genogroups. These results show a high prevalence and a diversity of TTV isolates in 
      feces.

TI  - Presence of Torque teno sus virus in porcine circovirus type 2-associated disease in 
      Croatia.
PG  - 529
LID - 10.1136/vr.100887 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is ubiquitous and species-specific, and two different TTV 
      species, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2), have 
      been described in domestic pigs and wild boars. Whether these two species are 
      involved in clinical cases of porcine circovirus type 2-associated disease (PCVDs) 
      remains unknown. This study investigates the presence of TTSuV in 85 fetuses, pigs 
      and wild boars infected by PCV2 and affected by PCVDs other than postweaning 
      multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy 
      syndrome. It also explores the genetic diversity of identified strains using 
      phylogenetic analysis. The presence or absence of TTSuV was determined in 85 samples 
      of PCV2-containing organs from 85 infected animals using a specific, one-step PCR 
      method. A nucleotide distance matrix between sequences was computed to infer 
      phylogeny based on a median-joining (MJ) network. TTSuV2 showed high prevalence in 
      animals affected by nephropathy and proliferative and necrotising pneumonia (PNP), 
      and both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 showed high prevalence in wild boars affected by PMWS. 
      TTSuV1 showed low prevalence in animals affected by nephropathy and PNP, and both 
      TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 showed low prevalence in animals with reproductive disorders. MJ 
      network analysis revealed significant genetic diversity among Croatian isolates.

TI  - Detection and Phylogenetic Analysis of Torque Teno Virus in Salivary and Tumor 
      Biopsy Samples from Head and Neck Carcinoma Patients.
PG  - 123-129
LID - 10.1159/000452974 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Because torque teno virus (TTV) has been implicated in tumorigenesis as 
      a cocarcinogen, we studied TTV prevalence in saliva and biopsy samples from head and 
      neck cancer (HNCC) patients, patients with premalignant lesions of oral cancer, and 
      controls. We also wished to determine the TTV genotypes in HNCC patients. METHODS: A 
      seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the N22 region of the TTV 
      genome, as well as direct sequencing of PCR fragments, was used. RESULTS: TTV 
      prevalence was higher in HNCC patients (saliva: 27/71, 38%; tumor biopsy: 22/74, 
      30%) than in controls (saliva: 8/56, 14%; oral mucosa: 1/19, 5%). TTV prevalence was 
      also high in patients with premalignant lesions of oral carcinoma (saliva: 9/18, 
      50%; biopsy: 5/21, 24%). By phylogenetic analysis, TTV belonging mostly to genotypes 
      1 and 2 was found in HNCC patients. In most of the cases, identical TTV strains were 
      present in the biopsy and salivary sample of the same HNCC patient. In addition, the 
      same TTV strain was detected in 2 laryngeal carcinoma biopsies obtained from 2 
      independent patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our data are compatible with the idea that TTV 
      might act as a cocarcinogen in certain cases of HNCC. Alternatively, HNCC may 
      facilitate either TTV replication or TTV entry into the saliva.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno 
      viruses, TTV) and other animals including swine (Torque teno sus viruses, TTSuV). 
      Two genetically distinct TTSuV species have been identified from swine thus far 
      (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), although their definitive association with disease remains 
      debatable. In 2012, a novel TTSuV species was identified from commercial swine serum 
      and classified in the genus Kappatorquevirus as TTSuVk2b. The other Kappatorquevirus 
      species, TTSuVk2a, has been associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting 
      syndrome (PMWS) when coinfected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Therefore, in 
      this study, we initially amplified a portion of TTSuVk2b ORF1 and, subsequently, 
      assessed the molecular prevalence of the virus in pigs in the United States. A total 
      of 127 serum and 115 tissue samples were obtained from pigs with PMWS or mulberry 
      heart disease (MHD) in six states and tested by PCR for the presence of TTSuVk2b 
      DNA. Approximately 27.6% of the serum and 21.7% of tissue samples tested positive 
      for TTSuVk2b DNA, and the positive products were confirmed by sequencing. However, 
      we did not detect a correlation between TTSuVk2b infection and PMWS or MHD. The near 
      full-length genomic sequence of US TTSuVk2b was determined, and sequence analysis 
      revealed that the US TTSuVk2b isolates were 95% identical to the TTSuVk2b isolate 
      from Spain, with most of the variations clustering in ORF1. We conclude that the 
      novel TTSuVk2b species is present in pigs in the United States and its potential 
      association with a disease warrants further investigation.

TI  - Molecular characterization of Torque teno virus and SEN virus co-infection with HIV 
      in patients from Southern Iran.
PG  - 275-9
LID - S0037-86822014000300275 [pii]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Torque teno virus (TTV) and SEN virus are circular single-stranded DNA 
      viruses that cause blood-borne infections. The SEN virus (SEN-V) was originally 
      detected in the serum of an injection drug user infected with human immunodeficiency 
      virus (HIV). Recently TTV was discovered as a potential causative agent of non-A-E 
      hepatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the SEN-V-D/H 
      and TTV in HIV patients and healthy blood donors in Iran. METHODS: One hundred and 
      fifty HIV patients with a mean age of 50.46 ± 18.46 years and 150 healthy blood 
      donors with a mean age of 48.16 ± 13.73 years were included in this study. TTV and 
      SEN-V were detected by the PCR and were quantitatively assayed by competitive PCR 
      (nested and semi-nested PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were 
      used to determine the heterogeneity of TTV. RESULTS: TTV and SEN-V were detected 96 
      (64%) and 84 (56%) of 150 HIV patients respectively. These rates were 34% (n=51) and 
      37.33% (n=56) in healthy blood donors (significant, p<0.05). PCR detected SEN-V/TTV 
      DNA from 32 of the healthy blood donors (21.33%), while 65 (43.33%) of HIV patients 
      were positive for SEN-V/TTV DNA. Of 150 HIV patients, 32.66% and 23.33% were 
      positive for SEN-V-H and SEN-V-D, respectively and 18.66% (n=28) were co-infected 
      with SEN-V-D/H. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SEN-VD/H and TTV is higher in HIV 
      patients than in healthy blood donors in Southern Iran. Our results suggest that TTV 
      and SEN-V might play a role in the development of liver disease in patients with 
      immunodeficiency diseases.

TI  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is highly prevalent in the European wild boar (Sus scrofa).
PG  - 223-9
AB  - The present study represents the first survey of Torque teno virus (TTV) prevalence 
      in European wild boar (Sus scrofa). The prevalence of two distinct TTV genogroups in 
      178 Spanish wild boar sera from different geographic regions, management conditions, 
      gender and age was determined by a nested PCR method. The overall prevalence of TTV 
      genogroups was 84% (58% for genogroup 1 and 66% for genogroup 2), and differences 
      between genogroup prevalence were observed depending on the geographical region 
      analysed. Significantly higher prevalence for TTV genogroup 2 was found in fenced 
      managed wild boar, juvenile animals and females. No other significant differences in 
      TTV genogroup prevalence were observed. The phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide 
      sequences obtained from the untranslated region of selected samples revealed that 
      the same TTV genogroups are infecting wild boar and domestic pig. The results 
      indicate that TTV is apparently ubiquitous in European wild boar populations.

      pigs.
PG  - 377-81

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a circular 
      single-stranded DNA genome, which are considered non-pathogenic. However, TTVs have 
      been eventually linked to human diseases. TTVs infecting pigs, Torque teno sus virus 
      1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), have been recently associated to porcine circovirus 
      diseases (PCVD). To get more insights into such potential disease association, the 
      aim of this study was to quantify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral loads in serum of pigs 
      affected by two PCVDs, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine 
      dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Such study was carried out by means of a 
      newly developed real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method. Both TTSuVs were highly 
      prevalent among studied pigs. TTSuV2 viral loads were significantly higher in PMWS 
      affected animals, further supporting the previously suggested association between 
      TTSuV2 and PMWS. On the contrary, TTSuV1 prevalence and loads were not related with 
      the studied PCVDs.

TI  - Serum torque teno virus DNA titer in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with 
      acute respiratory worsening.
PG  - 1015-9
LID - 10.2169/internalmedicine.54.3610 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Acute respiratory worsening is defined as the unexpected rapid 
      deterioration of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and idiopathic acute 
      respiratory worsening is known as an acute exacerbation of IPF. Torque teno virus 
      (TTV) is a circular single-stranded DNA virus whose pathological significance 
      remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and 
      titer of TTV DNA in IPF patients with acute respiratory worsening. METHODS: The 
      serum TTV DNA titer was measured using real-time PCR in nine IPF patients (two 
      treated with steroids and immunosuppressants; seven treated without steroids or 
      immunosuppressants) who developed acute worsening, including five patients with 
      acute exacerbation. The serum TTV DNA titer was also measured in eight stable IPF 
      cases and four IPF cases of lung cancer. In addition, in order to examine time 
      course changes in the TTV DNA titer, the titer was measured more than once, with an 
      interval of four weeks or longer, in eight patients. RESULTS: Among the nine IPF 
      patients with acute worsening, the TTV DNA titer was above 1×10(6) copies/mL in two 
      subjects without acute exacerbation who had been continuously treated with steroids 
      and immunosuppressants. Meanwhile, the mean TTV DNA titer was 2.4±2.6 (×10(4) 
      copies/mL) in the five patients with acute exacerbation and 3.1±3.4 (×10(4) 
      copies/mL) in the eight patients with stable IPF. Moreover, the TTV DNA titers were 
      increased in all three IPF patients who started treatment with steroids and 
      immunosuppressants. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that it is unlikely that TTV is 
      directly involved in the onset of acute exacerbation of IPF and that the serum TTV 
      DNA titer potentially reflects the immunosuppressive state of the host due to 
      treatment.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a large group of vertebrate-infecting small viruses 
      with circular single-stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. In swine, 
      two genetically distinct species, Torque teno sus virus 1a (TTSuV1a) and 1b 
      (TTSuV1b) are currently grouped into the genus Iotatorquevirus. More recently, a 
      novel Torque teno sus virus species, named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), has 
      been included with Torque teno sus virus k2a (TTSuVk2a) into the genus 
      Kappatorquevirus. In the present study, TTSuV1 (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), TTSuVk2a and 
      TTSuVk2b prevalence was evaluated in 721 serum samples of healthy pigs from 
      Sardinian farms, insular Italy. This is the largest study to date on the presence of 
      TTSuV in healthy pigs in Italy. The global prevalence of infection was 83.2% 
      (600/721), being 62.3% (449/721), 60.6% (437/721), and 11.5% (83/721) the prevalence 
      of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b, respectively. The rate of co-infection with two 
      and/or three species was also calculated, and data show that co-infections were 
      significantly more frequent than infections with single species, and that 
      TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a double infection was the prevalent combination (35.4%). Quantitative 
      results obtained using species-specific real time-qPCR evidenced the highest mean 
      levels of viremia in the TTSuV1 subgroup, and the lowest in the TTSuVk2b subgroup. 
      Interestingly, multiple infections with distinct TTSuV species seemed to 
      significantly affect the DNA load and specifically, data highlighted that double 
      infection with TTSuVk2a increased the viral titers of TTSuV1, likewise the 
      co-infection with TTSuVk2b increased the titers of TTSuVk2a.

      occurrence of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.
PG  - 276-81
LID - 10.1007/s11262-013-0940-0 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a member of the recently created family 
      Anelloviridae. Two distinct species of TTSuVs, 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) have been 
      reported so far in domestic pigs and wild boars. Although TTSuVs have not been 
      clearly linked to any specific disease of pigs, a relation between TTSuV infections 
      and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) has been suggested. To examine 
      further this possibility, the present study was conducted in search for TTSuV1 and 
      TTSuV2 genomes in tissues of PMWS and non-PMWS-affected animals. PMWS diagnosis was 
      established by clinical signs, characteristic macroscopic and histopathologic 
      lesions and the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 DNA. Samples of five different 
      tissues (lungs, kidneys, livers, spleens, and lymph nodes) from PMWS-affected and 
      non-PMWS-affected pigs were examined with two specific PCR assays developed to 
      amplify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genome segments. TTSuV1 DNA was detected in tissues of 
      non-diseased animals to significantly higher levels than in tissues of PMWS-affected 
      pigs (p ≤ 0.001). Regarding TTSuV2, viral genomes were detected in nearly all 
      samples from both PMWS-affected (94.7 %) and non-affected pigs (100 %), with no 
      significant differences in the frequencies of detection of TTSuV2 genomes in both 
      groups. No significant differences were detected on the distribution of TTSuV1 and 
      TTSuV2 in the different tissues examined (p = 0.970).

AB  - BACKGROUND: The human Torque Teno virus (TTV) causes persistent viremia in most 
      immunocompetent individuals. Elevated TTV levels are observed after solid organ 
      transplantation and are related to the extent of immunosuppression especially during 
      the phase of maintenance immunosuppression. However, the extent to which the TTV 
      increase in the early phase post-transplantation is associated with the patient's 
      immunosuppressive state is unclear. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we assessed the TTV 
      increase dynamics in detail during the first three months after lung transplantation 
      under a defined immunosuppressive regimen and in relation to the pre-transplant TTV 
      level. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-six lung transplant recipients (LTRs) were included in 
      this prospective longitudinal study. All received alemtuzumab induction combined 
      with tacrolimus and corticosteroids immunosuppressive therapy. Plasma TTV DNA was 
      monitored before transplantation and regularly within the first three months 
      post-transplantation (n = 320 samples; mean sampling interval: 12.2 days). RESULTS: 
      In 43/46 LTRs (93%), TTV DNA was detectable before transplantation (median 4.4 log10 
      copies/mL; range: 2.0-6.4). All 46 LTRs showed a TTV increase post-transplantation, 
      which followed a sigmoidal-shaped curve before the median peak level of 9.4 log10 
      copies/mL (range: 7.6-10.7) was reached at a median of day 67 (range: 41-92). The 
      individual TTV DNA doubling times (range: 1.4-20.1 days) significantly correlated 
      with the pre-transplant TTV levels calculated over 30 or 60 days 
      post-transplantation (r = 0.61, 0.54, respectively; both P < 0.001), but did not 
      correlate with the mean tacrolimus blood levels. Pre-transplant TTV levels were not 
      associated with time and level of the patients' post-transplant TTV peak load. 
      CONCLUSION: The TTV level may be used to mirror the state of immunosuppression only 
      after the patients' initial peak TTV level is reached.

AB  - The present work was aimed to investigate the torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 
      and 2) loads of different tissues of pigs affected by porcine circovirus type 2 
      (PCV2)-systemic disease (PCV2-SD) and healthy age-matched ones. A total of 20 pigs 
      (10 healthy and 10 diagnosed as PCV2-SD) were chosen for the study. From each pig, a 
      total of 7 tissues were analyzed, including lung, kidney, liver, ileum, bone marrow, 
      and mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes. TTSuV 1 and 2 were quantified by means 
      of species-specific real time quantitative PCR methods. Both TTSuVs were distributed 
      systemically. Results showed the highest loads for TTSuV2 in tissues from diseased 
      pigs. The highest TTSuV1 DNA load was found in bone marrow, lung, and liver, while 
      it was in bone marrow, mediastinal lymph node and liver for TTSuV2. Bone marrow was 
      the tissue with the highest viral DNA burden for both TTSuV species. Overall, 
      statistically significant differences were observed in viral DNA load, with TTSuV2 
      showing higher loads than TTSuV1 (p<0.05). Also, tissues from PCVD-SD affected pigs 
      showed higher TTSuV2 loads than tissues of the healthy group (p<0.05). It was 
      concluded that both TTSuVs had a wide tissue distribution all over the body, with 
      differential load comparing diseased versus healthy pigs. It is likely that other 
      tissues not included in this study would also be infected by TTSuVs.

AB  - Human anelloviruses (Torque Teno Virus (TTV) and TTV Like Mini Virus (TLMV)) are now 
      being reported at a high prevalence across the world, with a controversial 
      disease-inducing potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of 
      these anellovirus in vitreous of patients with presumed infectious endophthalmitis. 
      After informed consent, vitreous fluid from patients with endophthalmitis (n = 103) 
      and non-infectious pathologies (n = 102) were analyzed for the presence of TTV and 
      TLMV DNA by qPCR with the limit of quantification defined as 100 copies per 
      reaction. Among the patients clinically diagnosed with endophthalmitis, 29 of the 40 
      culture proven samples (72.5%) and 42 out of 63 (66.6%) of culture-negative samples 
      were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV. Interestingly, 51 of the 102 (50%) samples 
      in the control group were also positive for TTV/TLMV. Comparing the clinical outcome 
      among patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis, we observed no significant 
      association in the final visual acuity of patients who were positive for presence of 
      TTV/TLMV, however, these patients had significantly higher repeat antibiotic 
      injections (p = 0.03). Further evidence is however needed to correlate TTV / TLMV 
      with a particular pathology or group of pathologies in the eye.

LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-8-503 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV), of the Anelloviridae family, Iotatorquevirus 
      genus, is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, and negative sense DNA (ssDNA) virus 
      infecting human and many domestic animals including swines. Very little information 
      is known about the investigations of TTV prevalence in different swine breeds so 
      far. METHODS: In this study, 208 serum samples collected from seven swine breeds 
      (Rongchang pig, Chenghua pig, Zibet pig, Wild boar, Duroc, Landrace, Large 
      Yorkshire) from two independent farms were detected to determine the prevalence of 
      two swine TTV genogroups, TTV1 and TTV 2, by nested polymerase chain reaction 
      methods, and to analyse prevalence difference among these breeds. RESULTS: The 
      results showed that the prevalence of TTV in the seven breeds was 92%-100%. No 
      significant difference (p > 0.05) in TTV infection was observed between different 
      breeds. Interestingly, significantly higher prevalence for TTV1 in Rongchang boars 
      (90%) and for TTV2 in Rongchang sows (95%) were detected, while co-infection rate 
      (43.8%) was lower than other breeds. Sequence analysis showed that the homology of 
      TTV1 and TTV2 were over 90.9% and 86.4% in these breeds, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results indicated that TTV was widely distributed in the seven swine breeds. The 
      prevalence of both TTV genogroups associated with swine breeds and genders. This 
      study also respented the first description of swine TTV prevalence in different 
      swine breeds. It was vitally necessary to further study swine TTV pathogenicity.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus 
      infecting human and non-primate species. Two genogroups of TTV (TTV1 and TTV2) have 
      been described in swine so far. In the present study, TTV1 and TTV2 prevalences in 
      serum, and nasal as well as rectal swabs of 55 randomly selected piglets from seven 
      Spanish multi-site farms, were monitored from 1 to 15 weeks of age. Also, blood from 
      their dams (n=41) were taken at 1 week post-farrowing. Samples were tested by means 
      of two TTV genogroup specific PCRs. Although prevalence of TTV1 and TTV2 in sows was 
      relatively high (54% and 32%, respectively), it was not directly associated to their 
      prevalence in the offspring. Percentage of viremic pigs for both TTV genogroups 
      followed similar dynamics, increasing progressively over time, with the highest rate 
      of detection at 11 weeks of age for TTV1 and at 15 weeks for TTV2. Forty-two (76%) 
      and 33 (60%) of the 55 studied pigs were TTV1 and TTV2 PCR positive in serum, 
      respectively, in more than one sampling time. TTV1 and TTV2 viremia lasted in a 
      number of animals up to 15 and 8 weeks, respectively. Co-infection with both TTV 
      genogroups in serum was detected at all sampling points, but at 1 week of age. On 
      the contrary, there were animals PCR negative to both genogroups in serum at all 
      sampling times but at 15 weeks of age. During the study period, TTV1 and TTV2 nasal 
      shedding increased also over time and faecal excretion was intermittent and of low 
      percentage (<20%). In conclusion, the present study describes for the first time the 
      infection dynamics of TTV1 and TTV2 as well as the nasal and faecal excretion 
      throughout the life of pigs from conventional, multi-site farms. Moreover, results 
      indicate that both swine TTV genogroups are able to establish persistent infections 
      in a number of pigs.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped virus containing a single-stranded, 
      circular DNA genome of approximately 3.8kb. We completely synthesized the 3 808 
      nucleotides of the TTV (SANBAN isolate) genome, which contains a hairpin structure 
      and a GC-rich region. More than 100 overlapping oligonucleotides were chemically 
      synthesized and assembled by polymerase chain assembly reaction (PCA), and the 
      synthesis was completed with splicing by overlap extension (SOEing). This study 
      establishes the methodological basis of the chemical synthesis of a viral genome for 
      use as a live attenuated vaccine or gene therapy vector.

LID - 26655
AB  - Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs) are ubiquitous viruses which are highly prevalent in 
      several mammalian species. Human TTV's are epidemiologically associated with several 
      human disease conditions such as respiratory illnesses, auto-immune disorders and 
      hepatitis. Recently it was found that swine TTV's (TTSuVs) can act as primary 
      pathogens. The common occurrence of TTVs as environmental contaminants and the 
      increasing interest in the use of swine organs for xenotransplantation lend 
      importance to the question of whether TTV's can cross-infect across species. In this 
      study, we examined human and swine sera by swine or human TTV-specific PCRs, to 
      determine whether swine TTVs (TTSuV) DNA can be detected in humans and vice versa. 
      Surprisingly, both human and TTSuV DNA were present in a majority of the samples 
      tested. Transfection of human PBMC's with TTSuV1 genomic DNA resulted in productive 
      viral infection which was sustained for the three serial passages tested. 
      Lymphoproliferative responses in infected human PBMCs were diminished when compared 
      to the controls. Furthermore, mild to moderate antibody responses against the TTSuV1 
      ORF2 protein was detected in 16 of the 40 human sera by ELISA. Therefore, these 
      study findings provide initial and fundamental evidence for possible cross-species 
      transmission of TTVs.

AB  - Porcine torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) has been suggested as a co-factor for the 
      development of porcine circovirus-associated diseases. However, the pathogenic role 
      of TTSuV is still inconclusive, and the target cell and tissue tropism of this virus 
      are also ambiguous. In the present study, a multi-strained pooled probe-based in 
      situ hybridization was established to detect the nucleic acids of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 
      in the tissue. The strategy of using polymerase chain reaction-derived 
      digoxigenin-labeled multi-strained pooled probe, instead of single-strained probe or 
      oligonucleotide, was to overcome the fact of high sequence diversity among TTSuV 
      strains and simultaneous infection with distinct strains of TTSuV in the same 
      animal. The cell tropism and tissue distribution were evaluated by grading system 
      with tissues from major organs. Lymphoid tissues, including superficial inguinal, 
      mesenteric, and hilar lymph nodes, tonsil, intestinal lamina propria of mucosa and 
      Peyer's patches, and sometimes spleen, generally contained higher levels of positive 
      signals and are considered as the target sites for TTSuV. Morphologically, the 
      distribution of TTSuV-positive signals had a strong correlation with the T 
      lymphocyte zone. T lymphocytes are, thus, speculated as the major target cells for 
      TTSuV.

LID - 10.1002/jmv.24146 [doi]
AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) has been associated with non A-G hepatitis. The goal of this 
      study was to estimate the infection rates and genotypic characteristics of TTV in 
      the State of Qatar. A total of 644 blood samples representing different 
      nationalities: (i) Qatari (118) and (ii) non-Qatari (526) nationals (mostly from 
      Arab and South Eeast Asia countries) were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by 
      nested PCR. The majority (573) of the blood samples belonged to healthy blood 
      donors, whereas 54 and 53 of the blood samples belonged to patients infected with 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. The results 
      obtained showed that the TTV infection rates in the healthy blood donors, and those 
      infected with HBV or HCV patients were 81.4, 90.75 and 84.9%, respectively. 
      Significant association between TTV viremia and age, or nationality was observed. 
      Sequence analysis of PCR fragments amplified from the 5'-untranslated region 
      (5'-UTR) of all (531) TTV positive samples showed that 65.5% (348/531) of the PCR 
      fragment sequences were classified into main genogroup 3, followed by main 
      genogroups 5 (24%), 2 (5.8%), and 1 (4.7%). Genogroup 4 was not detected among the 
      our studied subjects. Phylogenetic and pairwise analyses using sequences from TTV 
      viremic samples also showed an overall close similarity to the main genogroup 3. In 
      conclusion, there was no significant difference in the rates of TTV detection among 
      Qataris and non-Qataris and several genotypes, mainly genotype 3, were isolated.

      tested exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples by semi-nested PCR assay. We detected 
      TTV DNA in 35% (7/20) of EBC samples collected from the mouth of one of the authors, 
      demonstrating that TTV DNA is excreted in exhaled breath with moderate frequency. 
      TTV DNA was detected also in oral EBC samples from 4 of 6 other authors, indicating 
      that TTV DNA excretion in exhaled breath is not an exception but rather a common 
      phenomenon. Furthermore, the same assay could amplify TTV DNA from room air 
      condensate (RAC) samples collected at distances of 20 and 40cm from a human face 
      with 40 (8/20) and 35% (7/20) positive rates, respectively. TTV transmission has 
      been reported to occur during infancy. These distances seem equivalent to that 
      between an infant and its household members while caring for the infant. Taken 
      together, it seems that exhaled breath is one of the possible transmission routes of 
      TTV. We also detected TTV DNA in 25% (10/40) of RAC samples collected at a distance 
      of more than 180cm from any human face, suggesting the risk of airborne infection 
      with TTV in a room.

AB  - An infectious etiology has been proposed for many human cancers, but rarely have 
      specific agents been identified. One difficulty has been the need to propagate 
      cancer cells in vitro to produce the infectious agent in detectable quantity. We 
      hypothesized that genome amplification from small numbers of cells could be adapted 
      to circumvent this difficulty. A patient with concomitant chronic lymphocytic 
      leukemia (CLL) and polycythemia vera (PV) requiring therapeutic phlebotomy donated a 
      large amount of phlebotomized blood to test this possibility. Using genome 
      amplification methods, we identified a new isolate (BIS8-17) of torque teno virus 
      (TTV) 10. The presence of blood isolate sequence 8-17 (BIS8-17) in the original 
      plasma was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), validating the approach, 
      since TTV is a known plasma virus. Subsequent PCR testing of plasmas from additional 
      patients showed that BIS8-17 had a similar incidence (~20%) in CLL (n = 48) or PV (n 
      = 10) compared with healthy controls (n = 52). CLL cells do not harbor BIS8-17; PCR 
      did not detect it in CLL peripheral blood genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (n = 
      20). CLL patient clinical outcome or prognostic markers (immunoglobulin heavy chain 
      variable region [IGHV ] mutation, CD38 or zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70 
      kDa [ZAP-70]) did not correlate with BIS8-17 infection. Although not causative to 
      our knowledge, this is the first reported isolation and detection of TTV in either 
      CLL or PV. TTV could serve as a covirus with another infectious agent or TTV variant 
      with rearranged genetic components that contribute to disease pathogenesis. These 
      results prove that this method identifies infectious agents and provides an 
      experimental methodology to test correlation with disease.

AB  - Viral infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has frequently been investigated as a possible candidate 
      and torque teno virus (TTV) has also been discussed in this context. Nevertheless, 
      mechanistic aspects remain unresolved. We report viral replication, as measured by 
      genome amplification, as well as quantitative PCR of two TTV-HD14 isolates isolated 
      from multiple sclerosis brain in a series of EBV-positive and -negative 
      lymphoblastoid and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Our results demonstrate the 
      replication of both transfected TTV genomes up to day 21 post transfection in all 
      the evaluated cell lines. Quantitative amplification indicates statistically 
      significant enhanced TTV replication in the EBV-positive cell lines, including the 
      EBV-converted BJAB line, in comparison to the EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell 
      line BJAB. This suggests a helper effect of EBV infections in the replication of 
      TTV. The present study provides information on a possible interaction of EBV and TTV 
      in the etiology and progression of multiple sclerosis.

      2 by inoculation.
PG  - 545
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-8-545 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Porcine torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a small icosahedral and 
      non-enveloped virus which contains a single-stranded (ssDNA), circular and negative 
      DNA genome and infects mainly vertebrates and is currently classified into the 
      'floating' genus Anellovirus of Circoviridae with two species. Viral DNA of both 
      porcine TTSuV species has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs 
      worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of 
      the same species has been documented in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, 
      there exists no information about histopathological lesions caused by infection with 
      porcine TTSuV2. METHODS: Porcine liver tissue homogenate with 1 ml of 6.91 × 107 
      genomic copies viral loads of porcine TTSuV2 that had positive result for torque 
      teno sus virus type 2 and negative result for torque teno sus virus type 1 and 
      porcine pseudorabies virus type 2 were used to inoculate specific pathogen-free 
      piglets by intramuscular route and humanely killed at 3,7,10,14,17,21 and 24 days 
      post inoculation (dpi), the control pigs were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of 
      sterile DMEM and humanely killed the end of the study for histopathological 
      examination routinely processed, respectively. RESULTS: All porcine TTSuV2 
      inoculated piglets were clinic asymptomatic but developed myocardial fibroklasts and 
      endocardium, interstitial pneumonia, membranous glomerular nephropathy, and modest 
      inflammatory cells infiltration in portal areas in the liver, foci of hemorrhage in 
      some pancreas islet, a tiny amount red blood cells in venule of muscularis mucosae 
      and outer longitudinal muscle, rarely red blood cells in the microvasculation and 
      infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and eosinophils) of tonsil and hilar 
      lymph nodes, infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes and necrosis or degeneration 
      and focal gliosis of lymphocytes in the paracortical zone after inoculation with 
      porcine TTSuV2-containing tissue homogenate. CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of these 
      presentations revealed that porcine TTSuV2 was readily transmitted to TTSuV-negative 
      swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in 
      specific pathogen-free piglets inoculated with porcine TTSuV2. Those results 
      indicated no markedly histopathological changes happened in those parenchymatous 
      organs, especially the digestive system and immune system when the specific 
      pathogen-free pigs were infected with porcine TTSuV2, hence, to some extent, it was 
      not remarkable pathological agent for domestic pigs at least. So, porcine TTSuV2 
      could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious etiology of swine. This study 
      indicated a directly related description of lesions responsible for TTSuV2 infection 
      in swine.

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) is the most abundant component of human virome. Virologists 
      have long ignored this orphan and highly divergent virus, in part because TTV cannot 
      be cultured and because it lacks serology reagents and animal models. Nevertheless, 
      it is almost endemic worldwide and is insensitive to current antiviral drugs, so its 
      monitoring is useful in various conditions. To date, TTV as a marker has proved 
      useful in at least two circumstances: to identify anthropogenic pollution and to 
      assess functional immune competence in immunosuppressed individuals. This review 
      summarizes recent findings about TTV and discusses the main hurdles in translating 
      them into clinical diagnostics.

TI  - Detection of swine torque teno virus in Italian pig herds.
PG  - 234-8
AB  - Anellovirus is a recently created, floating genus of viruses. Torque teno virus 
      (TTV), the type species in the genus, was first discovered in a human patient with a 
      post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. Recently, TTV genetically related 
      to but distinct from those discovered in humans have also been found in animals, 
      including pigs. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of swine TTV 
      in Italian pig herds and some risk factors possibly associated with this infection. 
      Serum samples from 179 healthy pigs from 10 farms located in north-central Italy 
      were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of swine TTV DNA. Viral 
      DNA was found in the sera of 43 pigs (24.0%), coming from eight of the 10 farms 
      examined. Prevalence was significantly higher in finishing herds (40.1%) than in 
      farrow-to-finish herds (11.0%) and did not depend on the size of the herd. Within 
      the finishing herds the prevalence was significantly higher in weaners (57.4%) than 
      in fatteners (22.9%), but this difference was not observed in farrow-to-finish 
      herds. No relationship was observed between the prevalence of swine TTV and the 
      implementation of some general hygiene practices and biosecurity procedures within 
      the herds.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been assigned to the floating genus Anellovirus. TTV 
      ssDNA genomes have a size of 3.6 to 3.8 kb and display up to 30% nucleotide 
      diversity. The pathogenic potential of TTV is under investigation. To address a 
      putative link of pathogenicity with the observed sequence variations, the 
      transcription profile of P/1C1 (genogroup 1) isolated from a patient diseased with a 
      non A-G hepatitis was analysed. Four mRNAs were identified, which encoded the seven 
      proteins ORF1, ORF1/1, ORF1/2, ORF2, ORF2/2, ORF3 and ORF4. Expression of the ORF1 
      protein and its splice variant ORF1/1 in cell culture was detected by an 
      ORF1-specific antiserum. Analysis of N-terminal tagged P/1C1-encoded proteins 
      revealed that ORF1, ORF1/1 and ORF1/2 were localised in the nucleoli, ORF3 and ORF4 
      resided in the nucleoplasm, ORF2/2 appeared either in the nucleoli or the whole 
      nucleus while ORF2 was the only protein seen in the cytoplasm.

AB  - Torque teno viruses [TTVs] are negative sense, single-stranded, DNA viruses, which 
      are distributed globally in several mammalian hosts such as humans, apes, sheep and 
      swine in a species-specific manner. While the pathogenic potential of TTVs is under 
      debate, recent experimental studies in gnotobiotic pigs indicate that swine TTVs, 
      TTSuV1 in particular, can act as a primary or co-infecting pathogen. Hence, 
      determining whether TTSuV1 can infect other mammals would eventually further our 
      understanding of viral pathogenesis, especially in coinfections. In this study, we 
      tested sera from horses, cattle, sheep, dogs and elk for the presence of TTSuV1 DNA 
      using a panel of TTSuV1-specific primers, and assessed the extent of sero-conversion 
      to TTSuV1 in the selected species. We found that TTSuV1 DNA was detected in 46.7% of 
      equines, 70% of canine, 100% of bovine, 40% of ovine and 93.3% of elk samples. 
      However, significant TTSuV1 specific antibody responses were detected only in the 
      bovine, ovine and equine samples but not the canine or elk samples, indicating that 
      these animals could support the replication of TTSuV1. This combined serological and 
      molecular epidemiological profile of TTSuV1 infection in five different species 
      indicates the host range of species-specific TTVs could be wider than initially 
      believed. Further studies are required to understand the health risks to these 
      animal species from TTSuV-1 infection.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is increasingly considered a universal marker of global 
      immune function. The virus is supposed to replicate in lymphocytes, but poor 
      information is available about fluctuations of viraemia after administration of 
      anti-lymphocyte agents. We studied TTV kinetics in a cohort of 70 kidney±pancreas 
      recipients receiving one of two different anti-T-cell induction immunosuppressants. 
      During the first 30 days after anti-T-cell antibody administration, we report 
      kinetics of TTV viraemia compatible with replication in T lymphocytes, and highly 
      dependent on the potency of the anti-T-cell drug administered.

TI  - Quantitative detection of porcine Torque teno virus in Porcine circovirus-2-negative 
      and Porcine circovirus-associated disease-affected pigs.
PG  - 261-4
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently identified virus that has a wide range of host 
      tropisms from humans to shrews. Human TTV and Torque teno mini virus are distributed 
      worldwide, and their high prevalence in human populations has been reported. Pigs 
      have their own species-specific TTV, and like human TTV, a high prevalence of 
      porcine TTV also has been reported. Despite its high prevalence, the role of 
      TTV-related disease or syndrome in humans and pigs has not been determined. In the 
      swine industry, TTV is thought to be one of the agents that aggravate clinical 
      manifestation of Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), a newly emerging, 
      economically devastating disease. The purpose of the current study was to quantify 
      TTV viral load in serum obtained from Porcine circovirus-2-negative pigs and 
      PCVAD-affected pigs with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays and 
      to compare TTV viral load between these groups. Results of this study indicate that 
      there are no statically remarkable differences in TTV viral load between the 2 
      groups, which indicates that TTV might not be an agent of aggravation in PCVAD.

LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.05.036 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a circular 
      single-stranded DNA genome, belonging to the family Anelloviridae. In swine, two 
      genetically distinct species have been identified, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) 
      and 2 (TTSuV2). The aim of the present work was to study the tissue distribution of 
      TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in pigs of different ages, including foetuses at the second and 
      last thirds of gestation, and animals at 5 days and 5, 15 and 24 weeks of age. 
      Investigated tissues included brain, lung, mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, 
      heart, liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow. Viral DNA from tissue extractions were 
      tested by a comparative PCR for the presence of TTSuVs. Overall, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 
      species were found in all tissues tested, with variations depending on age, and 
      following similar infection dynamics in all tissues, increasing progressively in 
      prevalence and virus load over time. The highest prevalence was found at 5 weeks of 
      age and maintained afterwards, and the highest loads of virus in the different 
      tissues were seen in the oldest animals (15 and 24 weeks of age). No animals were 
      negative to TTV, including foetuses. In conclusion, the present study indicated that 
      swine TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 can be found virtually in all body tissues of the pig. Both 
      swine TTV species were present in high levels in almost all older animals, while 
      viral negative tissues were only found in 5-week-old and 5-day-old pigs, and 
      foetuses.

TI  - Association of torque teno virus (TTV) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with liver 
      disease among patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C 
      virus.
PG  - 289-97

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) have been potentially 
      related to liver diseases. The aim of the study was to quantify TTV and TTMV in 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients to 
      study the relationship between the TTV and TTMV viral loads and the severity of 
      liver disease. We carried out a cross-sectional study in 245 patients coinfected 
      with HIV and HCV (HIV/HCV-group), 114 patients monoinfected with HIV (HIV-group), 
      and 100 healthy blood donors (Control-group). Plasma samples were tested for TTV and 
      TTMV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalences of 
      TTV and TTMV infections in the HIV/HCV-group and the HIV-group were significantly 
      higher than the Control-group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, TTV and TTMV coinfections 
      were found in 92.2 % (226/245) in the HIV/HCV-group, 84.2 % (96/114) in the 
      HIV-group, and 63 % (63/100 %) in the Control-group (p ≤ 0.05). HIV/HCV-coinfected 
      patients with HIV viral load ≥50 copies/mL and patients with severe activity grade 
      had the highest viral loads of TTV and TTMV (p ≤ 0.05). HIV/HCV-coinfected patients 
      with high TTV load (>2.78 log copies/μL) had increased odds of having advanced 
      fibrosis or severe necroinflammatory activity grade in the liver biopsy. Moreover, 
      HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with high TTMV load (>1.88 log copies/μL) had decreased 
      odds of having no/minimal fibrosis and no/mild activity grade, and increased odds of 
      having a high fibrosis progression rate. In conclusion, TTV and TTMV might play a 
      role in the development of liver disease in immunodeficiency patients, such as the 
      patients coinfected with HIV and HCV.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus--cause of viral liver disease following liver transplantation: a 
      case report.
PG  - 1378-9
LID - 10.1016/j.transproceed.2009.03.047 [doi]
AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV), a nonenveloped human virus of the Circoviridae family, is 
      hepatotropic, causing liver damage, cirrhosis, and, rarely, fulminant hepatitis. It 
      prevails in 10% to 75% of blood donors due to environmental differences, independent 
      of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HCV hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, alcoholic 
      cirrhosis, and in fulminant hepatitis non-A-G. Reports about the efficacy of 
      clinical alpha interferon are rare. In July 2007, a 65-year-old man who was 
      serologically negative for A-E viruses presented with acute liver failure due to a 
      ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm and underwent orthotopic liver transplantation 
      (OLT). Immunosuppression was based on cyclosporine and steroids. At postoperative 
      day 20, there was persistent hypertransaminasemia with otherwise normal liver 
      function. A percutaneous hepatic biopsy documented pattern suggestive of a viral 
      etiology. Multiple tests for hepatotropic viruses in the donor and the recipient 
      from the pre- and post-OLT periods remained negative. Only the TTV qualitative test, 
      assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient sera, was positive. 
      Immunosuppressive therapy was not changed; no antiviral therapy was undertaken. At 6 
      months posttransplantation, transaminase levels spontaneously normalized and the 
      clinical situation was unchanged. No complications were observed; the patient is in 
      good clinical condition. No graft rejection was observed. In histologically proven 
      non-A-E viral hepatitis, it is important to consider TTV as an incidental pathogenic 
      agent. It may be useful to extend virological tests to TTV among transplant 
      recipients and donors and to gain further knowledge about this virus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the sequence of ORF1 protein of Torque teno virus to prepare 
      for the future hybrid experiments. METHODS: The sequence of ORF1 protein of Torque 
      teno virus was analyzed by bioinformatics using some web tools. RESULTS: The most 
      likely cleavage site was between position 14aa and 15aa and signal peptide may be 
      position 1aa-14aa. Two possible transmembrane helices from inside to outside and 
      three possible transmembrane helices from outside to inside were found. The position 
      509 (NKTN) was the potential N-glycosylation site. The speculative molecular weight 
      of TTV ORF1 protein, which may be a kind of unstable protein was 88 705.7 Da. 
      1aa-91aa and 278aa-361aa were localized in non-regular secondary structure region. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TTV ORF1 protein may be a nuclear protein which contains two 
      non-regular secondary structure region. 265aa to 486aa and 510aa to 679aa may be the 
      two approciate fragments to construct the plasmids, which would be prepared for the 
      future hybrid experiments to study the functional positions of the protein and the 
      interactions between TTV and its hosts. Bioinformatics analysis would possibly make 
      it easier to study the protein's function.

LID - 10.1007/s00705-011-1169-7 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno midi virus and small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) are members of the genus 
      Gammatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. Cervical cancer is the second most 
      prevalent cancer after breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the 
      frequency of infection by these viruses in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women 
      from Isfahan, Iran. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from cervical 
      cancers (n = 42) and cervicitis cases (n = 79) were subjected to nested PCR to 
      identify TTMDV/SAV viral sequences. Of the 42 tumor cases, 22, 18 and 2 were 
      diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell 
      carcinoma, respectively. In total, 23 (55%) of the tumor samples were positive for 
      TTMDV/SAV. Of the 79 cervicitis cases, 38 (48%) were also positive for TTMDV/SAV. 
      This is the first report of TTMDV/SAV in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women.

TI  - Does Teno Torque Virus Induce Autoimmunity After Hematopoietic Stem Cell 
      Transplantation? A Case Report.
PG  - e194-7
LID - 10.1097/MPH.0000000000000194 [doi]
AB  - Teno Torque virus, member of the family of Anelloviridae, has been associated with 
      many autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, 
      and multiple sclerosis. Its viral load tends to be higher in the bone marrow and in 
      tissues with high turnover rate. We report here a case of an 11-month-old infant 
      affected by acute myeloid leukemia who underwent hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation, and after 6 months had autoimmune hepatitis and atopic dermatitis. 
      Extremely high-cytokine IP-10 and eotaxin levels were found in her sera, and 
      serological tests and RT-PCR for viruses showed positive results exclusively for 
      Teno Torque virus.

TI  - Full genome sequences of torque teno sus virus strains that coinfected a pig with 
      postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in Japan: implications for genetic 
      diversity.
PG  - 3067-74
LID - 10.1007/s00705-015-2593-x [doi]
AB  - We determined the complete genome sequences of torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) 
      detected in pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and in 
      healthy pigs in Japan. Unexpectedly, we found coinfection of a PMWS-affected pig in 
      Japan with one strain of TTSuV1, five strains of TTSuV2, and one strain of PCV2. 
      Full-genome sequencing of each of these strains, followed by phylogenetic analysis, 
      revealed broad genetic diversity in the TTSuV2 strains infecting the PMWS-affected 
      pig. These results suggest that the geographical bias in the available genetic 
      information about TTSuVs has a limited impact on the evaluation of their genetic 
      diversity.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of Torque Teno Virus genome from Pakistani isolate and 
      incidence of co-infection among HBV/HCV infected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque Teno Virus (TTV) was the first single stranded circular DNA virus 
      to be discovered that infects humans. Although there have been numerous reports 
      regarding the prevalence of TTV from other countries of South Asia, there is severe 
      lack of information regarding its prevalence in Pakistan. Thus the present study 
      compiles the first indigenous report to comprehensively illustrate the incidence of 
      the virus in uninfected and hepatitis infected population from Pakistan. Another aim 
      of the study was to present the sequence of full length TTV genome from a local 
      isolate and compare it with the already reported genome sequences from other parts 
      of the world. METHODS: TTV DNA was screened in the serum of 116, 100 and 40 HBV 
      infected, HCV infected and uninfected individuals respectively. Nearly full length 
      genome of TTV was cloned from a HBV patient. The genome sequence was subjected to 
      in-silico analysis using CLC Workbench, ClustalW, ClustalX and TreeView. Statistical 
      analysis was carried out in SPSS v17.0. RESULTS: Our results report that 89.7%, 
      90.0% and 92.5% of HBV, HCV patients and healthy control population were positive 
      for TTV infection. TTV genome of 3603 bp was also cloned from a local isolate and 
      given the identity of TPK01. The TTV genome sequence mentioned in this paper is 
      submitted in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under the accession number JN980171. Phylogenetic 
      analysis of TPK01 revealed that the Pakistani isolate has sequence similarities with 
      genotype 23 and 22 (Genogroup 2). CONCLUSION: The results of the current study 
      indicate that the high frequency of TTV viremia in Pakistan conforms to the reports 
      from other areas of the world, wherever screening of TTV DNA was performed against 
      5'-UTR of the genome. The high sequence diversity among TTV genome sequences and the 
      high frequency of prevalence makes it harder to study this virus in cellular 
      systems.

TI  - Detection of swine Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2 in boar sera and semen.
PG  - 966-71
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA virus 
      infecting swine and several other species. TTV is nowadays considered a 
      non-pathogenic virus in all species where it has been found. In the present study, 
      the prevalence of two distinct swine TTV genogroups in boar semen and sera was 
      determined by a nested PCR method. Furthermore, association between TTV infection 
      and semen qualitative and quantitative parameters was analyzed. TTV was detected in 
      74% of boar sera and 72% in semen. The prevalence of genogroup 1 in sera and semen 
      were 64% and 55%, respectively, while lower prevalence of genogroup 2 was observed 
      in both sera (38%) and semen (32%). Some significant associations of TTV infection 
      on semen characteristics in boar genetic lines were observed, but qualitative and 
      quantitative semen parameters obtained in studied boars fall into normal expected 
      ranges. Therefore, TTV semen infection was not evidenced to be harmful for the 
      studied qualitative and quantitative parameters of semen. The high rate of TTV in 
      semen suggests that sexual route might contribute to the transmission of the virus. 
      It is presently unknown if this potential vertical transmission of swine TTV implies 
      any effect on female reproductive tract. This study also represents the first 
      description of swine TTV presence in semen.

AB  - In the present study, the expression, generation and subcellular localization of 
      Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) proteins were characterized into two genetically 
      distinct TTSuV species (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2). Following transfection of three TTSuV1 
      and TTSuV2 full-length ORF (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3) expression constructs into porcine 
      kidney cells, alternative splice variants encoding new TTSuV protein isoforms were 
      identified for the first time. Proteins encoded from ORF1 and ORF3 were localized in 
      the nucleoli of porcine kidney cells and that of ORF2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus 
      excluding the nucleoli. The subcellular localization of the different protein 
      isoforms was not only similar between distinct TTSuV species but also to the ones 
      described in human Torque teno virus (TTV). Results of the present in vitro study 
      were not based on full-length viral clones but suggested that alternative splicing 
      strategy to generate TTSuV protein isoforms probably occurs in vivo. Obtained data 
      provide new information on molecular biology of TTSuV and anelloviruses, which until 
      now has been solely based on results obtained from human TTV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a small virus belongs to Anelloviridea 
      family. TTV is a disease orphan virus but it has often been associated with a 
      variety of pathologies and co-infections. TTV was recently identified as an 
      infectious agent that could potentially be involved in cases of acute enteritis. 
      OBJECTIVES: To ascertain the presence of TTV in stools from diarrheic and not 
      diarrheic people, and to investigate an association between infection, and patient 
      age and gender. STUDY DESIGN: Stool samples from people exhibiting signs of 
      enteritis (954) and from non-diarrheic individuals (76) were collected in the former 
      Chinook Health Region (CHR) in Southwestern Alberta, Canada from May 2008 to April 
      2009. Viral genetic material was extracted, and detection and quantification of TTV 
      were carried out by real-time PCR. The presence of other viral and bacterial enteric 
      pathogens was also investigated. RESULTS: More (P<0.001) diarrheic people (38.8%) 
      tested positive for TTV DNA than non-diarrheic individuals (18.4%). Furthermore, 
      viral load was greater (P<0.001) in stools from diarrheic (2.0×10(7)copies/g) than 
      non-diarrheic (2.0×10(3)copies/g) people. TTV DNA was detected most often in 
      diarrheic individuals that were 0-5 (57.3%) and greater than 81 (59.0%) years of 
      age. Combined across age, the prevalence of TTV was higher among men than women 
      (P=0.003). Co-infections with other enteric pathogens were observed. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This study revealed a significant association between TTV prevalence and viral load, 
      and enteritis. Also, TTV prevalence was significantly higher in the very young and 
      elderly suggesting that immunological status is important.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a group of viruses with small, circular DNA genomes. 
      Members of this family are thought to ubiquitously infect humans, although causal 
      disease associations are currently lacking. At present, there is no understanding of 
      how infection with this diverse group of viruses is so prevalent. Using a combined 
      computational and synthetic approach, we predict and identify miRNA-coding regions 
      in diverse human TTVs and provide evidence for TTV miRNA production in vivo. The TTV 
      miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer, and are 
      active in RISC. A TTV mutant defective for miRNA production replicates as well as 
      wild type virus genome; demonstrating that the TTV miRNA is dispensable for genome 
      replication in a cell culture model. We demonstrate that a recombinant TTV genome is 
      capable of expressing an exogenous miRNA, indicating the potential utility of TTV as 
      a small RNA vector. Gene expression profiling of host cells identifies N-myc (and 
      STAT) interactor (NMI) as a target of a TTV miRNA. NMI transcripts are directly 
      regulated through a binding site in the 3'UTR. SiRNA knockdown of NMI contributes to 
      a decreased response to interferon signaling. Consistent with this, we show that a 
      TTV miRNA mediates a decreased response to IFN and increased cellular proliferation 
      in the presence of IFN. Thus, we add Annelloviridae to the growing list of virus 
      families that encode miRNAs, and suggest that miRNA-mediated immune evasion can 
      contribute to the pervasiveness associated with some of these viruses.

AB  - The study describes a novel Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species, provisionally 
      named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), originally found in commercial pig sera 
      by applying the rolling-circle amplification technique. Full-length sequences of 
      TTSuVk2b were obtained, annotated and used in the phylogenetic analyses, which 
      revealed that TTSuVk2b is a novel Anellovirus species within the genus 
      Kappatorquevirus of the family Anelloviridae. Quantitative PCR techniques were 
      developed to determine total TTSuV DNA quantities as well as the prevalence and 
      viral DNA quantities of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b. The mean total TTSuV load in 
      seven commercial sera was determined at 6.3 log(10) DNA copies ml(-1) of serum, with 
      TTSuVk2b loads being the lowest at 4.5 log(10) DNA copies ml(-1) of serum. 
      Subsequently, prevalence and loads of TTSuVs were determined in pig sera from 17 
      countries. TTSuVk2b prevalence ranged from 0 to 100 % with viral loads from 3.3 to 
      4.6 log(10) copies ml(-1) of sera. TTSuVk2a, so far the only species in the genus 
      Kappatorquevirus, has been linked to an economically important swine disease, namely 
      post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Considering the grouping of 
      TTSuVk2b in the same genus as TTSuVk2a, TTSuVk2b prevalence and viral DNA load were 
      determined in PMWS-affected animals and healthy counterparts. This revealed that 
      TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b are not only genetically related, but also that their viral 
      loads in serum are elevated in PMWS animals compared with those of healthy pen 
      mates. In summary, the present work describes a novel TTSuV species including its 
      genetic characterization, epidemiological assessment and potential disease 
      association.

AB  - Anelloviridae family is comprised of small, non-enveloped viruses of various genome 
      lengths, high sequence diversity, sharing the same genome organization. Infections 
      and co-infections by different genotypes in humans are ubiquitous. Related viruses 
      were described in number of mammalian hosts, but very limited data are available 
      from the closest human relatives - great apes and non-human primates. Here we report 
      the 100% prevalence determined by semi-nested PCR from fecal samples of 16 captive 
      primate species. Only the Mandrillus sphinx, showed the prevalence only 8%. We 
      describe three new species of gorillas׳ and four new species of chimpanzees׳ 
      Betatorqueviruses and their co-infections in one individual. This study is also 
      first report and analysis of nearly full length TTMV genomes infecting gorillas. Our 
      attempts to sequence the complete genomes of anelloviruses from host feces 
      invariably failed. Broader usage of blood /tissue material is necessary to 
      understand the diversity and interspecies transmission of anelloviruses.

AB  - To investigate the detection rate and distribution of torque teno sus virus 1 
      (TTSuV1) in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) 
      positive/negative pigs, 2384 pathological tissues samples collected from 6 provinces 
      of Eastern China from 2010 to 2013 were amplified using previously published PRRSV 
      and TTSuV1 primers. The presence and viral load of TTSuV1 were investigated in a 
      wide range of samples from 5 PRRSV positive/negative 4-week-old pigs by real-time 
      TaqMan PCR. TTSuV1 was detected in 65.3% of 1115 PRRSV-positive samples, and 47.2% 
      of 1269 negative samples. Viral DNA was most commonly detected in the immune organs, 
      including spleen, lung, pancreas, and mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, followed 
      by serum, liver, kidney, trachea, anal swabs, nasal swabs and sex glands of 
      PRRSV-positive or negative pigs. TTSuV1 DNA loads in PRRSV-positive pigs increased 
      from 2 to 5 times in almost all the corresponding parts compared with PRRSV-negative 
      pigs. Statistical analysis showed that PRRSV may have a synergistic effect with 
      TTSuV1, and promote the replication and proliferation of TTSuV1.

TI  - Analysis of the entire genomes of torque teno midi virus variants in chimpanzees: 
      infrequent cross-species infection between humans and chimpanzees.
PG  - 347-358
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.007385-0 [doi]
AB  - Humans are frequently infected with three anelloviruses which have circular DNA 
      genomes of 3.6-3.9 kb [Torque teno virus (TTV)], 2.8-2.9 kb [Torque teno mini virus 
      (TTMV)] and 3.2 kb [a recently discovered anellovirus named Torque teno midi virus 
      (TTMDV)]. Unexpectedly, human TTMDV DNA was not detectable in any of 74 chimpanzees 
      tested, although all but one tested positive for both human TTV and TTMV DNA. Using 
      universal primers for anelloviruses, novel variants of TTMDV that are 
      phylogenetically clearly separate from human TTMDV were identified from chimpanzees, 
      and over the entire genome, three chimpanzee TTMDV variants differed by 17.9-20.3 % 
      from each other and by 40.4-43.6 % from all 18 reported human TTMDVs. A newly 
      developed PCR assay that uses chimpanzee TTMDV-specific primers revealed the high 
      prevalence of chimpanzee TTMDV in chimpanzees (63/74, 85 %) but low prevalence in 
      humans (1/100). While variants of TTV and TTMV from chimpanzees and humans were 
      phylogenetically interspersed, those of TTMDV were monophyletic for each species, 
      with sequence diversity of <33 and <20 % within the 18 human and three chimpanzee 
      TTMDV variants, respectively. Maximum within-group divergence values for TTV and 
      TTMV were 51 and 57 %, respectively; both of these values were substantially greater 
      than the maximum divergence among TTMDV variants (44 %), consistent with a later 
      evolutionary emergence of TTMDV. However, substantiation of this hypothesis will 
      require further analysis of genetic diversity using an expanded dataset of TTMDV 
      variants in humans and chimpanzees. Similarly, the underlying mechanism of observed 
      infrequent cross-species infection of TTMDV between humans and chimpanzees deserves 
      further analysis.

AB  - The expression profiles of nonstructural proteins (NSPs) in Torque teno sus virus 2 
      (TTSuV2) have not yet been characterized. Here, we determined the coding sequences 
      of the TTSuV2 NSPs ORF2, ORF2/2, and ORF2/2/3 by overlapping polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) and subsequent expression in bacterial and mammalian cells. We 
      generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2E5 and 6F8, from mice immunized with 
      mixed Escherichia coli expressing His-tagged ORF2 and ORF2/2. Enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis revealed that, 2E5 mAbs bound 
      to the consensus sequences of ORF2, ORF2/2, and ORF2/2/3, while 6F8 recognized the 
      common sequences of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed 
      that ORF2 was localized in the cytoplasm, ORF2/2, in the nucleus but not the 
      nucleolus, and ORF2/2/3, in the peri-nuclear region. To identify the expression 
      profiles of TTSuV NSPs, a circular TTSuV2_ZJ (GenBank: KF660540) genomic DNA clone 
      was constructed and transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells. Splicing mRNAs and the 
      expression and localization of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3 were identified by RT-PCR, 
      western blot analysis, and IFA, respectively. However, ORF2 was not detected either 
      at the RNA or protein level. Our study is the first to provide experimental evidence 
      of the existence of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3 at the protein level. Moreover, the mAbs 
      have potential applications in future research on TTSuV2 viral protein function and 
      diagnosis of related diseases.

TI  - Presence of Torque teno virus (TTV) in tap water in public schools from Southern 
      Brazil.
PG  - 41-5
LID - 10.1007/s12560-012-9096-7 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) was surveyed in tap water collected in schools from three 
      municipalities located in the south of Brazil. TTV genomes were found in 11.7 % 
      (4/34) of the samples. TTV DNA was detected in 10.5 % (2/19) of the samples 
      collected at the city of Caxias do Sul and in 25 % (2/8) of the samples from 
      Pelotas. Those cities have a low rate of sewage treatment. All samples from Santa 
      Cruz do Sul, which has nearly 92 % of its sewage treated, were negative. These 
      results suggest that the amount of sewage treated may have an effect on the 
      detection rates of TTV DNA in drinking water in a given urban area, showing a mild 
      negative correlation (r = -0.76), when comparing the percentage of sewage treatment 
      to the detection of TTV genomes. The detection rate of TTV was also compared with 
      Escherichia coli, showing a strong correlation (r = 0.97), indicating that TTV may 
      be a suitable marker of fecal contamination.

TI  - Dynamics of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) DNA loads in serum of 
      healthy and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) affected pigs.
PG  - 284-90
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.05.020 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are vertebrate infecting, small viruses with circular 
      single stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. In pigs, two different 
      TTV species have been described so far, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 
      (TTSuV2). TTSuVs have lately been linked to postweaning multisystemic wasting 
      syndrome (PMWS). In the present study, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 prevalence and DNA loads in 
      longitudinally collected serum samples of healthy and PMWS affected pigs from 
      Spanish conventional, multi-site farms were analyzed. Serum samples were taken at 1, 
      3, 7, 11 and around 15 weeks of age (age of PMWS outbreak) and viral DNA loads 
      determined by quantitative PCR. For both TTSuV species, percentage of viremic pigs 
      increased progressively over time, with the highest prevalence in animals of about 
      15 weeks of age. TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral DNA loads in healthy and TTSuV1 loads in 
      PMWS affected animals increased until 11 weeks of age declining afterwards. On the 
      contrary, TTSuV2 DNA loads in PMWS affected pigs increased throughout the sampling 
      period. It seems that TTSuV species differ in the in vivo infection dynamics in PMWS 
      affected animals.

TI  - Progression towards AIDS leads to increased Torque teno virus and Torque teno 
      minivirus titers in tissues of HIV infected individuals.
PG  - 1-7
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno minivirus (TTMV) are highly prevalent in the 
      general population and although no disease has been associated with these viruses 
      yet, co-infections with other pathological viruses are frequent. Both viruses are 
      extremely heterogeneous, especially for DNA viruses, and the role of the immune 
      system in controlling the infections has yet to be established. In this study the 
      TTV/TTMV viral loads in HIV positive tissues have been investigated for the first 
      time. The titers of both TTV and TTMV were compared in the bone marrow and spleen 
      tissues from three groups: HIV negative individuals, HIV positive individuals and 
      HIV positive individuals who had progressed to AIDS, leading to immunosuppression. 
      Limiting dilution PCR using primers situated in the UTR region of the genome were 
      used to semi-quantitate the virus, and TTV and TTMV were differentiated using 
      melting curve analysis of the PCR product. The AIDS group had significantly higher 
      titers compared with both the HIV positive and negative groups for both bone marrow 
      (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.006, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001) and spleen (AIDS 
      vs. HIV positive P = 0.022, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001). Analysis of TTV/TTMV 
      titer with CD4 T lymphocyte count showed a significant inverse correlation however 
      neither HCV co-infection or type of Anellovirus infection (single TTV or TTMV, or 
      mixed TTV/TTMV) showed any significant correlation with virus titer. The results 
      show a link between deterioration of the immune system and increased the viral loads 
      in studied tissues.

AB  - This study investigates the frequency of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in 150 
      blood donors and 77 patients requiring haemodialysis in southern Brazil. Plasma 
      samples were screened for TTV DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The 
      prevalences of TTV among blood donors and patients requiring haemodialysis were 
      73.3% and 68.8%, respectively. The presence of TTV was correlated with age in the 
      blood donors (p = 0.024). In haemodialysis patients, no association was found 
      between TTV infection and the demographic parameters (age, sex and education), the 
      duration of haemodialysis or a history of blood transfusion. This study is the first 
      to evaluate the prevalence of TTV infection in Brazilian patients requiring 
      haemodialysis.

TI  - Identification and genomic characterization of a novel human torque teno virus of 
      3.2 kb.
PG  - 1939-44
AB  - In the process of searching for the recently described small anelloviruses 1 and 2 
      (SAVs) with the genomic DNA length of 2.2 or 2.6 kb in human sera, we isolated a 
      novel virus with its genomic organization resembling those of torque teno virus 
      (TTV) of 3.8-3.9 kb and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) of 2.8-2.9 kb. The entire 
      genomic sequence of three isolates (MD1-032, MD1-073 and MD2-013), which comprised 
      3242-3253 bases and exhibited 76-99 % identities with the SAVs within the 
      overlapping sequence, was determined. Although the MD1-032, MD1-073 and MD2-013 
      isolates differed by 10-28 % from each other over the entire genome, they segregated 
      into the same cluster and were phylogenetically distinguishable from all reported 
      TTVs and TTMVs. These results suggest that SAVs are deletion mutants of the novel 
      virus with intermediate genomic length between those of TTV and TTMV and that the 
      novel virus can be classified into a third group of the genus Anellovirus.

AB  - Infection with the Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is believed to be common yet 
      limited information is available on the epidemiology of TTSuV. The objectives of 
      this study were to develop novel and improve existing diagnostic methods for TTSuV 
      infection and to investigate the prevalence of TTSuV species 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 
      (TTSuV2) in the USA. Three hundred and four blood or fetal thoracic fluid samples 
      were collected from pigs on 40 US farms in 12 States. Samples were collected from 
      fetuses and in pre-suckle neonates (n=73), suckling pigs (1-20 days of age; n=27), 
      nursery pigs (21-55 days of age; n=60), finisher pigs (8-25 weeks of age; n=90) and 
      adults (>25 weeks of age; n=54). Samples were tested by a new quantitative 
      differential real-time PCR for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 DNA and by ELISA for detection of 
      anti-TTSuV2-antibodies. The prevalence of TTSuV1 DNA ranged from 8.2% (fetuses and 
      neonates) to 81% (finisher pigs) and the prevalence of TTSuV2 DNA ranged from 3.7% 
      (suckling pigs) to 67% (finisher pigs). Evidence of fetal TTSuV infection was 
      minimal. Mixed infection of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was seen in 6.7% of the nursery pigs, 
      52.2% of the finisher pigs, and 22.2% of the mature pigs. The prevalence of TTSuV1 
      was higher than that of TTSuV2. Anti-TTSuV2 antibodies were not detected in the 
      fetuses and neonates and the seroprevalence of TTSuV2 was between 3.8% and 100% in 
      growing pigs. The results of this study indicate that vertical transmission may not 
      be a main route of TTSuV transmission in pigs in the USA.

TI  - Swine torque teno virus detection in pig commercial vaccines, enzymes for laboratory 
      use and human drugs containing components of porcine origin.
PG  - 648-653

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are vertebrate infecting, single-stranded circular DNA 
      viruses. Two genetically distinct TTV genogroups (TTV1 and TTV2) infect swine 
      worldwide with high prevalence. Currently, swine TTVs are considered non-pathogenic, 
      although TTV2 has been linked to post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, a 
      porcine circovirus disease. On the other hand, pig materials are an important source 
      of components used in porcine vaccine manufacturing, human drugs and commercial 
      enzyme products. However, there is little information about the possible existence 
      of extraneous viruses in products containing porcine-derived components. In the 
      present study, 26 commercial swine vaccines, seven human drugs and three enzyme 
      products from porcine origin were tested for the presence of TTV1 and TTV2 genomes 
      by PCR. Four vaccines against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae were positive for TTV2 by 
      PCR. Three M. hyopneumoniae, one porcine parvovirus and one porcine reproductive and 
      respiratory syndrome virus vaccines were PCR positive for TTV1. One human drug 
      contained TTV1 DNA as well as a trypsin enzyme; a porcine-derived elastase product 
      was positive for both TTV genogroups. These results show that swine TTVs are 
      contaminants not only of swine vaccines but also of human drugs containing porcine 
      components and enzymes for laboratory use.

AB  - In this study, 40 pigs with respiratory and wasting disorders from Cuban swine herds 
      were screened by PCR for the presence of TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PCV-2, PPV and CSFV in 
      spleen samples. The variability of the porcine TTSuV sequences obtained was 
      investigated by phylogenetic analysis. This study showed for the first time that 
      TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were present in Cuban swine herds. The investigation revealed the 
      following infection rates: TTSuV1 40%, TTSuV2 37.5%, PCV-2 70%, PPV 37.5% and CSFV 
      in 52.5%. The presence of two or more of these viruses at different rates in the 
      same spleen samples was revealed. Also, a higher genetic diversity of TTSuV2 
      sequences was observed regarding TTSuV1 sequences.

AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the presence of Torque teno sus virus 
      types 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) in a longitudinally (14 to 150 days of age) 
      collected paired pooled sera (pSE) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pPBMCs) 
      using nested polymerase chain reaction. The detection rate of TTSuV1 in pSE 
      increased from 14 to 90 days of age, but a progressive decline was observed from 120 
      to 150 days of age, while in pPBMC, a high value was maintained till the end of 
      growing-finishing period. On the contrary, except in PBMCs at 30 days of age, high 
      detection rates of TTSuV2 were found in both pSE and pPBMCs in all sampling ages. 
      The detection rate of TTSuVs between pSE and pPBMCs was positively correlated at all 
      sampling ages except for TTSuV1 at 150 days of age. This is the first study showing 
      the presence of TTSuVs in PBMCs from pigs and describing the in vivo infection 
      dynamics of TTSuV in paired sera and PBMCs during the entire growing and finishing 
      periods of pigs reared in conventional farms.

TI  - Serological profile of torque teno sus virus species 1 (TTSuV1) in pigs and 
      antigenic relationships between two TTSuV1 genotypes (1a and 1b), between two 
      species (TTSuV1 and -2), and between porcine and human anelloviruses.
PG  - 10628-39
LID - 10.1128/JVI.00176-12 [doi]
AB  - The family Anelloviridae includes human and animal torque teno viruses (TTVs) with 
      extensive genetic diversity. The antigenic diversity among anelloviruses has never 
      been assessed. Using torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) as a model, we describe here the 
      first investigation of the antigenic relationships among different anelloviruses. 
      Using a TTSuV genotype 1a (TTSuV1a) or TTSuV1b enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) based on the respective putative ORF1 capsid antigen and TTSuV1-specific 
      real-time PCR, the combined serological and virological profile of TTSuV1 infection 
      in pigs was determined and compared with that of TTSuV2. TTSuV1 is likely not 
      associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), because both the 
      viral loads and antibody levels were not different between affected and unaffected 
      pigs and because there was no synergistic effect of concurrent PCV2/TTSuV1 
      infections. We did observe a higher correlation of IgG antibody levels between 
      anti-TTSuV1a and -TTSuV1b than between anti-TTSuV1a or -1b and anti-TTSuV2 
      antibodies in these sera, implying potential antigenic cross-reactivity. To confirm 
      this, rabbit antisera against the putative capsid proteins of TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b, or 
      TTSuV2 were generated, and the antigenic relationships among these TTSuVs were 
      analyzed by an ELISA and by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using PK-15 cells 
      transfected with one of the three TTSuV ORF1 constructs. The results demonstrate 
      antigenic cross-reactivity between the two genotypes TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b but not 
      between the two species TTSuV1a or -1b and TTSuV2. Furthermore, an anti-genogroup 1 
      human TTV antiserum did not react with any of the three TTSuV antigens. These 
      results have important implications for an understanding of the diversity of 
      anelloviruses as well as for the classification and vaccine development of TTSuVs.

TI  - Genetic relationship of Torque Teno virus (TTV) between humans and camels in United 
      Arab Emirates (UAE).
PG  - 188-91
AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) species-cross infection has been documented. However, the 
      genetic relationship between human and animal TTV remains uncertain. In this study, 
      genotypic characterization of TTV in different Camel specimens from the United Arab 
      Emirates (UAE) was undertaken for comparison with human UAE TTV. A total of 56 
      specimens: 34 sera, 14 raw, and 8 pasteurized milk samples were tested for TTV. The 
      results showed that the rate of infection was, 38.2% (13/34), 35.7% (5/14), and 100% 
      (8/8), for the samples of sera, raw, and pasteurized milk respectively. The 
      5'untranslated region (5'UTR) of 23 clones that were generated from PCR products 
      amplified from Camel samples (three sera, three raw, and two pasteurized milk 
      samples) were subjected to sequence analysis. The camel TTV clones were classified 
      as genotype 11 (47.8%), group 5 (43.5%), and SENV-H or genotype 16 (8.7%) which are 
      among the predominant genotypes found in humans in the UAE. Phylogenetic analysis of 
      representative sequences revealed that the similarity between isolates from camels 
      and humans is 92%-97% for the same genotypes. The data lead to the conclusion that 
      camels and humans share a common source of TTV infection in the UAE.

TI  - Detection of Torque teno virus in Epstein-Barr virus positive and negative lymph 
      nodes of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma.
PG  - 731-5
AB  - The age-specific incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is bimodal with peaks occurring 
      among young adults (15 - 34 years old) and people older than 45 years. Epstein-Barr 
      virus (EBV) is associated with only one-third of HL cases. This study sought to 
      determine if Torque teno virus (TTV) might be independently associated with HL. The 
      presence of EBV was appraised by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in 
      lymph node biopsies from 46 patients (3 - 81 years old) with HL. TTV DNA was 
      assessed by PCR amplification. EBV was detected in 22 (48%) patients. TTV DNA was 
      detected in 24/46 (52%) patients, as well as in 12/20 (60%) control patients with 
      lymphoid unspecific hyperplasia. TTV DNA was not significantly more frequent in EBV 
      negative (54%) than in EBV positive (50%) nodes. However, it was observed that the 
      group of young adults (15 - 34 years, n = 19) showed the lowest EBV frequency (21%) 
      but the highest TTV occurrence (60%). This may suggest an involvement of TTV 
      infection in the pathogenesis of HL in young adults. Further large population-based 
      studies are required to confirm our findings.

TI  - Porcine Torque teno virus: determination of viral genomic loads by 
      genogroup-specific multiplex rt-PCR, detection of frequent multiple infections with 
      genogroups 1 or 2, and establishment of viral full-length sequences.
PG  - 202-12
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2009.12.005 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded 
      DNA genome. TTV is currently classified in the unassigned genus Anellovirus, and 
      distinct TTVs of tentative species-status infect a wide range of vertebrates. In 
      domestic pigs and wild boars, porcine TTV occurs in two genogroups, TTV1 and TTV2, 
      which are currently detected using only conventional PCR assays. To allow 
      high-throughput testing, the present study describes development of a multiplex 
      real-time (rt)-PCR assay for efficient simultaneous detection of TTV1 and TTV2. To 
      demonstrate usefulness of this rt-PCR assay for large-scale testing, 203 serum 
      samples from domestic pigs were screened for TTV infection. The detected rates of 
      single TTV1, single TTV2, and double TTV1/TTV2 infections were 32, 17, and 32% and 
      represent the first report on the occurrence of porcine TTV in Germany. In addition, 
      100 wild boar lung samples were tested that confirmed high prevalences of TTV 
      infection. Moreover, establishment of genogroup-specific rt-PCR standards allowed 
      the determination of mean viral genomic loads in sera from TTV-infected swine to 
      about 10(4.5)/ml, respectively. To verify the specificity of the rt-PCR assay, 
      conventional PCR assays that amplify genogroup-specific, size-distinguishable 
      products from the TTV untranslated regions were designed. In total, 50 clones 
      derived from 24 PCR products obtained from 19 TTV1 and TTV2 single- or 
      double-infected animals were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences 
      demonstrated the frequent occurrence of multiple infections with distinct porcine 
      TTVs of the same genogroup. Moreover, two porcine TTV full-length sequences were 
      established, one for each genogroup.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) has a non-enveloped, single-stranded, 
      negative-sense circular DNA genome, and it is widely distributed in pigs. Open 
      reading frame 1 (ORF1) of TTSuV1 can be transcribed into mRNA and then translated 
      into protein; however, its promoter has not yet been identified. We used a 
      dual-luciferase reporter system, involving pGL3-Basic and pRL-TK, to identify the 
      promoter of TTSuV1 ORF1. Our results revealed that the sequence between nucleotides 
      196 and 525 promoted the transcription of the firefly luciferase gene. The core 
      sequence of the promoter was between nucleotides 250 and 400. A comparison of the 
      identified TTSuV1 ORF1 promoter with that from cytomegalovirus (CMV) suggested that 
      the two promoters were similar in strength. Our findings provide new information 
      regarding the molecular biology of TTSuV1 and have revealed a new promoter that can 
      be used in plasmids for numerous applications.

PG  - 2008-13
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a novel hepatitis virus which is considered to be 
      transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Wastewater samples were collected monthly from 
      eight wastewater treatment plants in Japan for 1 year, from July 2003 to June 2004, 
      and tested for the presence of TTV by TaqMan PCR. TTV was detected in 97% (93/96) of 
      influent samples, implying that TTV is epidemic in Japan. TTV was also isolated in 
      18% (17/96) of secondary effluent samples before chlorination and in 24% (23/95) of 
      final effluent samples after chlorination. There was no significant difference 
      between the concentration of total coliform in TTV-positive final effluents and that 
      in TTV-negative final effluents, which indicates that total coliform cannot be used 
      as an indicator of TTV. No TTV was detected in 24 effluents for reuse from two 
      wastewater treatment plants using sand filtration and ozonation.

AB  - Sera from 15 patients coinfected with TTV and HIV-1, collected before and at two 
      times after introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), were 
      tested for TTV load and the presence of the five highly divergent TTV phylogenetic 
      groups. Seven patients showed a 1-5 log TTV load decrease during HAART, while the 
      others did not show significant variations. A decrease in the number of coinfecting 
      TTV genogroups was detected in 12 of 15 patients, with the mean number of TTV 
      genogroups/patient decreasing from 2.33 before HAART to 1.47 at the last collect. 
      All five genogroups were less frequently found after introduction of HAART. Three 
      hundred sixty-seven TTV clones from four different genogroups, derived from two 
      patients, were sequenced. Noticeable fluctuations in TTV subpopulation frequencies 
      were observed in both patients analyzed. In conclusion, HAART tends to reduce the 
      number of TTV genotypes/genogroups and may affect the balance between different TTV 
      isolates coinfecting single individuals.

AB  - The aim of this work is to identify antigenic regions within the ORF1 protein of 
      Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno virus sus 2 (TTSuV2) that could be 
      used as antigens to detect virus-specific antibodies following infection in pigs. 
      Protein sequences of TTSuV ORF1 genes were analysed to predict linear antigenic 
      epitopes. Synthesized peptides were analysed for serological reactivity with swine 
      sera. Such an antigenic region was identified at the C terminus of the ORF1 protein 
      of both viruses and showed serological reactivity with 78 % (TTSuV1) and 88 % 
      (TTSuV2) of swine sera. An ELISA with an immunodominant peptide as antigen was used 
      to examine the sera of piglets, aged 4-20 weeks, and adults. Results indicated that 
      TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-specific antibodies were detectable at 4 weeks. Antibody titres 
      increased from week 10 and peaked at week 20. A relatively high antibody titre 
      persisted to adulthood.

TI  - Analysis of the entire genomes of fifteen torque teno midi virus variants 
      classifiable into a third group of genus Anellovirus.
PG  - 1961-75
AB  - Recently, we identified a novel human virus with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, 
      tentatively designated as torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a genomic 
      organization resembling those of torque teno virus (TTV) of 3.8-3.9 kb and torque 
      teno mini virus (TTMV) of 2.8-2.9 kb. To investigate the extent of genomic 
      variability of TTMDV genomes, the full-length sequence was determined for 15 TTMDV 
      isolates obtained from viremic individuals in Japan. The 15 TTMDV isolates comprised 
      3175-3230 bases and shared 67.0-90.3% identities with each other, and were only 
      68.4-73.0% identical to the 3 reported TTMDV isolates over the entire genome. TTMDV 
      possessed a genomic organization with four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) with 
      characteristic sequence motifs and stem and loop structures with high GC content, 
      similar to TTV and TTMV. The total of 18 TTMDV genomes differed by up to 60.7% from 
      each other in the amino acid sequence of ORF1 (658-677 amino acids), but segregated 
      phylogenetically into the same cluster, which was distantly related to the TTVs and 
      TTMVs. These results indicate that TTMDV with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, has 
      an extremely high degree of genomic variability, and is classifiable into a third 
      group in the genus Anellovirus.

LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2010.12.008 [doi]
AB  - In the present study, two isolates (SH-F1 and SH-F2) of Torque teno felis virus 
      (feline TTV) were detected in 16 (12.5%) serum samples collected from cats in China. 
      Their full length genomes were cloned and sequenced. The results showed that they 
      were 2063bp in length and contained three open reading frames (ORFs) (ORF1: 
      nt438-1748, ORF2: nt268-585 and ORF3: nt268-581, 1461-1842). Phylogenetic analysis 
      showed that they were clustered with the strain of Japan (Fc-TTV4, AB076003) and the 
      strain of France (PRA4, EF538878). Sequence analysis indicated that SH-F1 had high 
      (97.5% and 93.3%) identity with the strain of Japan and the strain of France, and 
      SH-F2 shared 94.5% and 92.1% homology with them, respectively. In conclusion, we 
      demonstrated that feline TTV is present in China.

PG  - 347-50

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) was first isolated from a human hepatitis patient in 1997. 
      TTV was also identified in several animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, cats and 
      dogs. In this study, we analysed the prevalence of swine TTV genogroups 1 (TTV1) and 
      2 (TTV2) in Japanese swine populations with suspected post-weaning multisystemic 
      wasting syndrome and porcine respiratory disease by using a nested polymerase chain 
      reaction method. Of 153 serum samples from 16 different herds in Japan, TTV1 was 
      detected in 46 samples (30%), TTV2 in 47 samples (31%) and both in 15 samples (10%). 
      There was no significant difference in the detection rate among geographical 
      regions. The overall prevalence rate of TTV genogroups was significantly lower in < 
      or = 30-day-old pigs (11%) compared to that in older age groups (54-82%). These 
      results suggest that swine TTV may be widespread in post-weaning pigs and could play 
      aetiological roles in pig diseases in Japan. This is the first report on the 
      prevalence of swine TTV in Japan.

AB  - Simultaneous Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) 
      infections have been reported around the world, generally linked to severe 
      infections. In the present study, 257 swine plasma samples from 31 swine herds 
      located in Brazil, were PCR screened for PCV-2 and TTSuV-1/2 and correlated with 
      clinical data. PCV-2 was detected in 25%, followed by 38.1% and 42.4% of TTSuV-1 and 
      TTSuV-2, respectively. Co-infections of two or three viruses were found in 32.3% of 
      samples. PCV-2 was more frequently detected in the growing (p=0.030) and finishing 
      phases (p=0.0005) while TTSuV-2 in the nursery (p=0.009). Only TTSuV-1 was 
      statistically associated to clinical disease (multiple signs), in combination or not 
      with PCV-2 or TTSuV-2 (p=0.015). PCV-2/TTSuV co-infections were more frequently 
      related to weight gain reduction in comparison to mono-infections (p=0.049) and 
      no-infections (p=0.027), and also in animals with (p=0.011) or without (p=0.037) 
      clinical signs, being the nursery the most affected phase (p=0.025). Our results 
      uphold the pathogenic potential of TTSuV in naturally infected pigs and the 
      clinical/economical impact of this agent, especially in co-infections. Studies 
      addressing the physiopathological mechanisms of simultaneous infections are needed.

AB  - Diversity of TTV1 was assessed in the head and neck region in patients with 
      potentially malignant (oral lichen planus, oral leukoplakia) and malignant lesions 
      (oral and laryngeal squamous cell cancers) and was compared to that found in the 
      uterine cervix (cervical atypia and cervical cancer) by directly sequencing the 
      NG061-063 segment of ORF1. These sequences were classified by the formerly used 
      genogroup-genotype system as well as by the newly accepted species classification by 
      aligning with the corresponding region of the type sequences of the 29 TTV species. 
      All sequences obtained during the study clustered together with the TTV1 type 
      sequence; to express diversity within TTV1, genotypes and subtypes of the former 
      classification were used.The commonest subtypes were 2c followed by 2b, 1a and 1b. 
      Subtypes 2b and 2c were evenly distributed among cervical samples; subtype 1a was 
      more frequent in patients with cervical atypia or cancer. Subtypes 2c was more 
      frequent than 2b in head and neck lesions. In conclusion, genotype and even subtype 
      distribution may be important in association with diseases, therefore using this 
      classification for characterization of intraspecies diversity of TTV1 is proposed.

AB  - In this study we detail the detection and genetic analysis of a novel porcine 
      boca-like virus (PBo-likeV) in archival sera and tissue samples from pigs from farms 
      in Great Britain. We also investigate the distribution of porcine circovirus type 2 
      (PCV2) genotypes and Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) genogroups 1 and 2 in combination 
      with this novel PBo-likeV. PBo-likeV was detected in over 70% of all tissues 
      investigated. Over 24% of all tissues recovered from PMWS-affected animals had all 
      viruses present and 25% of tissues recovered from non-PMWS-affected pigs were 
      positive for all 4 viruses.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether porcine genogroup 1 torque teno virus (g1-TTV) can 
      infect and cause disease in gnotobiotic swine. SAMPLE POPULATION: 20 conventional 
      baby pigs and 46 gnotobiotic baby pigs. PROCEDURES: Porcine g1-TTV was transmitted 
      from conventional swine to gnotobiotic pigs via pooled leukocyte-rich plasmas (n=18) 
      that had positive results for g1-TTV DNA. Bone marrow-liver homogenates that had 
      positive results for torque teno virus (TTV) were used in 4 serial passages in 
      gnotobiotic pigs (2 pigs/passage). A pathogenesis experiment was conducted with in 
      vivo passages of g1-TTV in various groups of gnotobiotic pigs. RESULTS: All g1-TTV 
      inoculated pigs had no clinical signs but developed interstitial pneumonia, 
      transient thymic atrophy, membranous glomerulonephropathy, and modest lymphocytic to 
      histiocytic infiltrates in the liver after inoculation with the TTV-containing 
      tissue homogenate; these changes were not detected in uninoculated control pigs or 
      pigs injected with tissue homogenate devoid of TTV DNAs. In situ hybridization was 
      used to identify g1-TTV DNAs in bone marrow mononuclear cells. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Analysis of these data revealed that porcine g1-TTV was readily 
      transmitted to TTV-naïve swine and that infection was associated with characteristic 
      pathologic changes in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with g1-TTV. Thus, g1-TTV could be 
      an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious agent of swine. This indicated a 
      directly associated induction of lesions attributable to TTV infection in swine for 
      a virus of the genus Anellovirus.

AB  - The pathogenic role of Torque teno sus viruses 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), and their 
      capacity to induce lesions are controversial. TTSuVs have been linked to porcine 
      circovirus diseases (PCVDs) and described as cause of mild respiratory lesions in 
      gnotobiotic pigs; moreover, an increased TTSuV prevalence has been found in porcine 
      respiratory disease complex (PRDC) affected pigs. In the present study, TTSuV1 and 
      TTSuV2 loads and their prevalence were evaluated in formalin-fixed, 
      paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung samples displaying different types of inflammatory 
      lesions. Such measurements were made by means of a real time quantitative PCR 
      technique to detect these viruses. The technique was optimised for its use on FFPE 
      tissues comparing results with frozen lung tissues. Selection criteria included 
      negativity against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and 
      respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) and swine 
      influenza virus (SIV). Results from the present study demonstrated that both TTSuVs 
      were present in lung. However, TTSuV2 had higher viral load and prevalence in all 
      the studied groups when compared to TTSuV1. TTSuV2 mean load was also higher in 
      lungs with viral background (interstitial pneumonia and broncho-interstitial 
      pneumonia) when compared to normal lungs or to those with bacterial background 
      (catarrhal-purulent bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis and fibrinous-necrotizing 
      pleuropneumonia). This result suggests a possible role of TTSuV2 in the pathogenic 
      mechanism of inflammatory lesions of lungs compatible with viral infection.

AB  - The role of swine torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) as co-factors in disease 
      syndromes involving porcine circovirus strain 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and 
      respiratory disease syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been a debatable subject. In this 
      study, the prevalence of TTSuVs in Iowa, the leading pork producing state in the 
      U.S., was estimated by a duplex PCR. The PCR is capable of simultaneously detecting 
      both teno sus viruses 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and 2). Based on an analysis of 300 random 
      samples representing six major geographical regions of the state, the overall 
      prevalence rates for TTSuV1 and 2 were 47.34% and 24.67% respectively while the 
      combined prevalence rate was 52.33%. The epidemiological association of TTSuV1 and 2 
      with the common etiological agents of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) 
      namely porcine PRRSV, PCV2, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and swine influenza virus (SIV) 
      was estimated in lung tissue derived from 45 pigs showing clinical signs of PRDC. 
      Notably, 86.67% of the PRDC-suspect samples were positive for TTSuV1 in comparison 
      to the baseline population prevalence rate of 47.34%. However, the prevalence of 
      TTSuV2 (26.67%) was not significantly different. TTSuV1 was detected in 80.00%, 
      81.81%, 75.00% and 77.78% of the PRRSV, SIV, M. hyopneumoniae and PCV2 positive 
      PRDC-suspect samples respectively. Our results indicate that TTSuV1 is strongly 
      associated with clinical PRDC and support the hypothesis that TTSuVs might function 
      as co-factors in PRDC. Further studies to define their possible role in the 
      pathogenesis of swine respiratory diseases are warranted.

TI  - One-year monthly monitoring of Torque teno virus (TTV) in river water in Italy.
PG  - 191-5
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is prevalent worldwide in general populations but at present 
      is not related with any specific pathology. Its presence in faeces and its 
      remarkable environmental stability suggest the possibility of using it as an 
      indicator of faecal contamination in the environment. To evaluate the waterborne 
      spread of TTV and its possible relationship with human pathogen enteric viruses, 
      water samples were collected monthly for a year (May 2004-April 2005) from a river 
      receiving the effluent of the treatment plant of the city of Pisa, concentrated and 
      assayed with bimolecular tests (PCR, RT-PCR). TTV was detected in three samples 
      (25%) while 16% of samples were positive for enteroviruses, 33% for rotaviruses, 8% 
      for noroviruses genotype 1 and 25% for noroviruses genotype 2. Only two TTV samples 
      (June and January) were also positive for rotavirus and norovirus, respectively. The 
      detection of TTV in water confirmed its possible faecal-oral route of transmission 
      but data are still insufficient to draw conclusions about the role of TTV as a viral 
      indicator.

TI  - Molecular detection of bovine and porcine Torque teno virus in plasma and feces.
PG  - 271-6
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is frequently detected in humans, livestock and some 
      companion animals. Very little is known about presence of TTV in Canadian livestock 
      and the goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of TTV in swine and cattle 
      using molecular tools. TTV DNA was detected and confirmed by sequencing in the 
      plasma of 90.5% and in the feces of 60.3% of the animals tested in a single swine 
      herd as well as 80.9% and 1.1% in the plasma of individuals from general Quebec 
      swine and cattle populations, respectively. The impact of the TTV presence in 
      livestock population for the agri-food chain should be further investigated.

AB  - This work aimed to detect and study natural co-infection of Circoviridae torque teno 
      virus (TTV) and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) in the swine reproductive apparatus. 
      Semen and organs from 17 boars were tested by nested and real-time PCR. PCV2 was 
      amplified from semen (47%), lymph nodes (84.6%) and testicles (35.3%). TTV2 was 
      amplified from 16/17 testis and 13/13 lymph nodes. TTV1 DNA was detected in fewer 
      testicle samples (2/17), which were also TTV2 positive. Analyzed ovaries, follicular 
      fluid and uteri of 83 culled sows showed TTV2, TTV1 and PCV2 from 49.3%, 30.1% and 
      6.0% of the sows, respectively. Sperm analysis indicated insignificant differences 
      between PCV2 and TTVs positive and negative boars. The most frequent pathologic 
      lesion in sows was endometritis (28.9%), but this was unassociated with PCV2 or TTVs 
      detection. These findings question the importance of PCV2 and TTV2 natural 
      co-infection in the pathology of porcine reproductive failures.

TI  - CO-INFECTION OF ADENOVIRUS, NOROVIRUS AND TORQUE TENO VIRUS IN STOOLS OF PATIENTS 
      WITH ACUTE GASTROENTERITIS.
PG  - 1326-36
AB  - Up to now, there has been no report of co-infection of torque teno virus (TTV) with 
      other enteric viruses playing a role in the pathogenesis of viral acute 
      gastroenteritis (AGE). We investigated the proportion, epidemiological and clinical 
      features of concurrent infections of adenovirus (ADV), norovirus (NV) and TTV in 
      stools of 155 patients with AGE attending Wei-Gong Memorial Hospital, Miaoli City, 
      Taiwan. The presence of the three viruses were determined using PCR-based assays. 
      Some 55% of the patients were infected with at least 1 enteric virus, among whom 18% 
      were co-infected, NV and TTV being the most common (62%). Rate of co-infectious in 
      AGE patients is correlated statistically significantly (p < 0.05) with age, fever 
      and drinking of spring water. Furthermore, AGE children with co- infection have a 
      higher hospitalization rate (69%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first 
      report of ADV, NV and TTV triple co-infection in children (2) with AGE. This study 
      also revealed that TTV co-infection promoted the pathogenicity of other infectious 
      agents.

PG  - 361-377
LID - 10.1007/s13760-018-0976-y [doi]
AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes demyelination of white matter of central nervous 
      system and neuro-degeneration due to inflammation. Different types of MS, as well as 
      disease progression, come with different pathology and pathophysiology. The 
      objective of this study was to evaluate the possible association between different 
      micro-organisms and the relapse or progression of MS. Studies indexed in 
      Medline/PMC, Scopus and Web of Science published without time and language 
      limitation until March 2017 were identified through the search terms "infection" or 
      "infectious" and "multiple sclerosis". A total of 20878 abstracts were identified 
      through the initial search terms. Selection of articles and assessment of their 
      quality was done based on Cochrane library guidelines. Full texts were reviewed for 
      33 articles out of which 14 articles met the criteria for inclusion. Different 
      micro-organisms are known to play roles in the pathogenesis of MS and its relapse; 
      including Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), Epstein-Barr 
      virus (EBV), Chlamydia pneumoniae and Torque teno virus (TTV). But in this review 
      only HHV-6, C. pneumoniae and TTV have been considered to play a role in disease 
      progression in some studies and not all of them. This review concluded that some 
      micro-organisms such as HHV-6, C. pneumoniae and TTV have been considered as 
      cofactors to make MS a progressive type. It should be considered that these findings 
      do not necessarily rule out the role of other pathogens in MS progression but may 
      represent population differences or different sensitivity of the technique used.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether commercial Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae bacterins sold 
      for use in swine contain porcine torque teno virus (TTV). SAMPLE POPULATION: 22 
      commercially available M hyopneumoniae bacterins. PROCEDURES: Direct and nested PCR 
      assays for genogroup-specific TTV DNAs were performed on serials of M hyopneumoniae 
      bacterins by use of published and custom-designed primer pairs at 3 laboratories in 
      North America and Europe. RESULTS: Of the 22 bacterins tested by use of direct and 
      nested PCR assays, 7 of 9 from the United States, 2 of 5 from Canada, and 4 of 8 
      from Europe contained genogroup 1- and genogroup 2-TTV DNAs. In some bacterins, the 
      TTV DNAs were readily detected by use of direct PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: Analysis of these data indicated that many of the commercially available 
      M hyopneumoniae bacterins were contaminated with TTV DNA. It is possible that some 
      of these bacterins could inadvertently transmit porcine TTV infection to TTV-naïve 
      swine.

TI  - Expression of all six human Torque teno virus (TTV) proteins in bacteria and in 
      insect cells, and analysis of their IgG responses.
PG  - 182-9
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2008.09.012 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped human virus with a circular ( 
      approximately 3800 nt) ssDNA genome. TTV transcription results in three viral mRNAs 
      and six proteins, the function or antigenicity of which are unknown. The six open 
      reading frames of TTV genotype 6 were expressed in bacteria and insect cells. 
      Expression of the ORF1/1-encoded protein was inefficient, while expression of the 
      others was successful, with ORF1 and ORF1/2 as arginine-rich region depleted. All 
      six recombinant TTV proteins were antigenic. Of healthy adults, 11/25 (44%) showed 
      strong IgG reactivity with one or more proteins. Four subjects, two of whom were 
      genotype-6-DNA positive, were followed. One of the latter showed concurrently a 
      strong IgG response against the ORF1 protein. The other showed appearance of IgG 
      against the ORF2 protein concomitantly with resolution of the genotype-6 viremia. 
      The genotype-6 sequences remained unaltered for years, suggesting that some 
      mechanisms other than amino acid substitutions play a role in TTV immune evasion.

TI  - Short communication: Detection of human Torque teno virus in the milk of water 
      buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis).
PG  - 5928-32
LID - 10.3168/jds.2009-2265 [doi]
AB  - Forty-four raw milk and 15 serum samples from 44 healthy water buffaloes reared in 
      Caserta, southern Italy, the most important region in Europe for buffalo breeding, 
      were examined to evaluate the presence of Torque teno viruses (TTV) using molecular 
      tools. Furthermore, 8 pooled pasteurized milk samples (from dairy factories having 
      excellent sanitary conditions) and 6 Mozzarella cheese samples were also tested. 
      Four of the cheese samples were commercial Mozzarella cheese; the remaining 2 were 
      prepared with TTV-containing milk. Human TTV were detected and confirmed by 
      sequencing in 7 samples of milk (approximately 16%). No TTV were found in serum, 
      pooled pasteurized milk, or Mozzarella cheese samples. The samples of Mozzarella 
      cheese prepared with TTV-containing milk did not show any presence of TTV, which 
      provides evidence that standard methodological procedures to prepare Mozzarella 
      cheese seem to affect viral structure, making this food fit for human consumption. 
      The 7 TTV species from water buffaloes were identified as genotypes corresponding to 
      the tth31 (3 cases), sle 1981, sle 2031, and NLC030 (2 cases each) human isolates. 
      Although cross-species infection may occur, detection of TTV DNA in milk but not in 
      serum led us to believe that its presence could be due to human contamination rather 
      than a true infection. Finally, the mode of transmission of TTV has not been 
      determined. Contaminated of the food chain with TTV may be a potential risk for 
      human health, representing one of the multiple routes of infection.

TI  - Evaluation of pepper mild mottle virus, human picobirnavirus and Torque teno virus 
      as indicators of fecal contamination in river water.
PG  - 1358-68
LID - 10.1016/j.watres.2010.10.021 [doi]
AB  - A reliable indicator is needed to predict and reduce the risk of infection 
      associated with fecal contamination of surface water. Since Pepper mild mottle virus 
      (PMMoV), human picobirnaviruses (hPBV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) have been 
      detected at substantial levels in human feces, we explored whether detection of 
      nucleic acids of these viruses is a suitable indicator of fecal contamination in 
      river water. From September 2008 to December 2009, water samples (n = 111) were 
      collected from the Ruhr and Rhine rivers and from the influents and effluents of a 
      wastewater plant (n = 12). Quantitative real time (RT-) PCR was used to determine 
      the abundance of PMMoV, hPBV, and TTV in comparison to human adenoviruses (HAdV) and 
      human polyomaviruses (HPyV) that are frequently detected in surface water and were 
      previously proposed as indicators. While PMMoV was detected in all river water 
      samples, the other viruses were detected less frequently. The concentration of the 
      studied viruses in positive river water ranged from 5 × 10(1) to 1.07 × 10(6) genome 
      equivalents per liter (gen.equ./l). All wastewater samples were positive for PMMoV, 
      HAdV and HPyV, while TTV and hPBV were detected in 6/12 and 3/12 of samples, 
      respectively. To determine if PMMoV is specific to human-derived fecal waste, fecal 
      samples from human (n = 20) and animal (n = 53) were also tested. In contrast to the 
      ubiquity of PMMoV in human feces (19/20) the virus was only detected at low 
      concentration in a minority of the animal fecal samples tested (7/15 from chicken, 
      1/10 from Geese and 1/6 from cows). Therefore, in this setting TTV and hPBV do not 
      seem to be suitable indicators of fecal contamination in water. Whereas, the high 
      excretion level and dissemination of PMMoV in human sewage and river water suggest 
      that PMMoV could be a promising indicator of fecal pollution in surface water.

LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2010.08.013 [doi]
AB  - Thirteen genomes of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) were obtained to 
      examine the diversity and evolution of swine TTVs. Despite the low nucleotide 
      identity reported, the genomic organization and transcriptional profiles of TTVs are 
      similar. The nucleotide diversity for TTSuV1 was higher than TTSuV2, and the pattern 
      of mutation among the ORFs was also different. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses 
      support the proposed division of TTV into two species. TTSuV1 showed high levels of 
      variability (>30%), with three different types (the third described for the first 
      time) that may display a geographical structure. In contrast, TTSuV2 showed lower 
      levels of variability (<15%), and no different types could be described. Larger 
      values for the ratios of synonymous (dS) to non-synonymous (dN) base substitutions 
      (dS/dN) were reported for the ORFs pointing to a certain level of selective 
      constraint in TTV genomes.

AB  - To test requirement for apoptin in the replication of chicken anemia virus (CAV), an 
      apoptin-knockout clone, pCAV/Ap(-), was constructed. DNA replication was completely 
      abolished in cells transfected with replicative form of CAV/Ap(-). A reverse mutant 
      competent in apoptin production regained the full level of DNA replication. DNA 
      replication and virus-like particle (VLP) production of CAV/Ap(-) was fully 
      complemented by supplementation of the wild-type apoptin. The virus yield of a point 
      mutant, CAV/ApT(108)I, was 1/40 that of the wild type, even though its DNA 
      replication level was full. The infectious titer of CAV was fully complemented by 
      supplementing apoptin. Progeny virus was free from reverse mutation for T(108)I. To 
      localize the domain within apoptin molecule inevitable for CAV replication, 
      apoptin-mutant expressing plasmids, pAp1, pAp2, pAp3, and pAp4, were constructed by 
      deleting amino acids 10-36, 31-59, 59-88 and 80-112, respectively. While Ap1 and Ap2 
      were preferentially localized in nuclei, Ap3 and Ap4 were mainly present in 
      cytoplasm. Although complementation capacity of Ap3 and Ap4 was 1/10 of the wild 
      type, neither of them completely lost its activity. VP3 of TTV did fully complement 
      the DNA replication and VLP of CAV/Ap(-). These data suggest that apoptin is 
      inevitable not only for DNA replication but also VLP of CAV. The common feature of 
      apoptin and TTV-VP3 presented another evidence for close relatedness of CAV and TTV.

TI  - First description of Adenovirus, Enterovirus, Rotavirus and Torque teno virus in 
      water samples collected from the Arroio Dilúvio, Porto Alegre, Brazil.

AB  - Adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV), genogroup A rotaviruses (GARV) and Torque teno 
      virus (TTV) are non-enveloped viral agents excreted in feces and so may contaminate 
      water bodies. In the present study, the molecular detection of these viruses was 
      performed in samples of surface water collected from the Arroio Dilúvio, a 
      waterstream that crosses the city of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, receiving great 
      volumes of non-treated sewage from a large urban area. Sampling was performed during 
      2009, in three different occasions (January, April and September). The highest 
      detection rate was observed for EV (64.28%), followed by TTV (28.57%) and AdV 
      (21.43%). Rotaviruses were not detected. More than on kind of tested virus was 
      detected in five (35. 71%) of 14 samples. January was the month with the highest 
      viral detection rate, being all samples, collected in this month, positive for at 
      least one group of tested virus. The correlation between the detection of these 
      different viral agents and environmental factors is discussed. To the knowledge of 
      the authors, this is the first description of viral genomes in water samples taken 
      from the Arroio Dilúvio, Porto Alegre (Brazil).

TI  - TT viruses in animals.
PG  - 35-52
AB  - Infection with TT virus (Torque teno virus, TTV), a small, nonenveloped virus with a 
      circular, single-stranded DNA genome classified in the floating genus Anellovirus, 
      is not restricted to humans. Using highly conserved primers derived from the 
      untranslated region of the human TTV genome, a variety of TTV-like viruses have been 
      found circulating in nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees, macaques, and tamarins. 
      TTV variants in nonhuman primates are species-specific, although some genetic groups 
      of human and chimpanzee TTVs cluster to make human/chimpanzee clades. TTVs from 
      macaques and tamarins are increasingly divergent from TTV variants infecting humans 
      and chimpanzees. TTV-like mini virus (TTMV) infections have also been detected in 
      chimpanzees, with genotypes distinct but interspersed with human TTMV genotypes. 
      Pets are also naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and several isolates 
      have been found in cats and dogs. In addition, other mammals such as tupaias and 
      pigs have species-specific TTVs: swine TTVs are found among pigs worldwide. The 
      genomic organization and proposed transcriptional profiles of TTVs infecting 
      nonhuman primate and other mammalian species are similar to those of human TTVs, and 
      co-evolution of TTVs with their hosts has been suggested. To date, TTVs infecting 
      nonhuman primates and other mammalian species have been under-examined. It is likely 
      that essentially all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs.

TI  - Detection and follow-up of torque teno midi virus ("small anelloviruses") in 
      nasopharyngeal aspirates and three other human body fluids in children.
PG  - 1537-41
LID - 10.1007/s00705-011-1021-0 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno midi virus/small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the family 
      Anelloviridae. It has a single-stranded, circular, negative-sense DNA genome. Its 
      pathogenic role in human disease remains to be confirmed. In this study, viral 
      shedding, molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTMDV/SAV were studied in 
      human body fluids. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with acute 
      respiratory disease were tested by PCR/nested PCR for TTMDV/SAV in two seasons 
      (2005/2006, 2006/2007). Two years later, additional urine, stool, and serum samples 
      and nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from eight symptomless children for 
      follow-up investigation. Forty-three (46.7%) of the 92 nasopharyngeal aspirates 
      collected contained TTMDV/SAV. High genetic diversity was observed; however, 
      identical sequences were also detected in two patients. The mean age of the infected 
      children was 3 years (1 months-8 years), and 58% of them were female. Co-infection 
      with RSV was detected in 23% of the samples. In a follow-up study, nasopharyngeal 
      aspirates and serum of six (75%), stool samples of four (50%) and urine samples of 
      two (25%) of the eight children were anellovirus-positive. None of the anellovirus 
      sequences were identical in the two collection periods, but identical sequences were 
      detected in different body fluids collected at the same time from the same child. 
      TTMDV/SAVs shedding was detected in four human body fluids. As a consequence, it is 
      possible that generalized infection and fecal/uro-oral transmission of TTMDV/SAV 
      occur. TTMDV/SAVs are frequently present in nasopharyngeal aspirates, although the 
      variants may only be transient agents. Further research is needed to investigate the 
      pathogenesis and pathogenic role of TTMDV/SAV.

PG  - 1343-1347
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.80794-0 [doi]
AB  - Multiply primed rolling-circle amplification is a novel technology that uses 
      bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase to amplify circular DNA molecules, without the 
      need for prior knowledge of their sequences. In an attempt to detect Torque teno 
      virus (TTV), rolling-circle amplification was used to amplify DNA extracted from 
      eight human and four pig serum samples. All samples gave high molecular weight (>30 
      kb) amplification products. By restriction endonuclease digestion, these products 
      generated DNA fragments whose sizes were consistent with those of human TTV (3.8 kb) 
      and swine TTV (Sd-TTV; 2.9 kb) genomes. Two TTV isolates derived from a single AIDS 
      patient, as well as two Sd-TTV isolates derived from a single pig, were 
      characterized by complete nucleotide sequencing. One of the Sd-TTV isolates showed 
      very low (43-45 %) nucleotide sequence similarity to the other Sd-TTV isolate and to 
      the prototype isolate Sd-TTV31, and could be considered the prototype of a novel 
      genogroup.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae comprises torque teno viruses (TTVs) diverse in genome 
      structure and organization. The isolation of a large number of TTV genomes (TTV 
      Heidelberg [TTV-HD]) of 26 TTV types is reported. Several isolates from the same 
      type indicate sequence variation within open reading frame 1 (ORF1), resulting in 
      considerably modified open reading frames. We demonstrate in vitro replication of 12 
      full-length genomes of TTV-HD in 293TT cells. Propagation of virus was achieved by 
      several rounds of infections using supernatant and frozen whole cells of initially 
      infected cells. Replication of virus was measured by PCR amplification and 
      transcription analyses. Subgenomic molecules (μTTV), arising early during 
      propagation and ranging in size from 401 to 913 bases, were cloned and 
      characterized. Propagation of these μTTV in in vitro cultures was demonstrated in 
      the absence of full-length genomes.

TI  - Studies of porcine circovirus type 2, porcine boca-like virus and torque teno virus 
      indicate the presence of multiple viral infections in postweaning multisystemic 
      wasting syndrome pigs.
PG  - 59-64

AB  - In a previous study, using random amplification and large-scale sequencing 
      technology, we identified a novel porcine parvovirus belonging to the genus 
      Bocavirus in the background of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) in Swedish pigs 
      with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In addition to bocavirus we 
      demonstrated the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2 in these 
      cases of PMWS, indicating the simultaneous presence of several viruses in this 
      disease complex. In the present study, 34 PMWS-affected animals and 24 pigs without 
      PMWS were screened by PCR for the presence of PCV-2, TTV-1, TTV-2 and porcine 
      boca-like virus (Pbo-likeV). The studies revealed the following infection rates in 
      the PMWS-affected pigs: PCV-2 100%, TTV-1 77%, TTV-2 94% and Pbo-likeV 88%. In 
      comparison, the pigs without PMWS had the following rates: PCV-2 80%, TTV-1 79%, 
      TTV-2 83% and Pbo-likeV 46%. The sequence identity between the different Swedish 
      Pbo-likeV sequences ranged between 98% and 100%. By checking co-infection, it was 
      found that 71% of the PMWS-affected pigs harbor simultaneously all these viruses. As 
      a contrast, in the group without PMWS only 33% of the animals were positive 
      simultaneously for these viruses. These observations indicate a multiple viral 
      infection in PMWS-affected pigs. It has to be studied further if the clinical 
      manifestation of PMWS might be due to synergistic effects of different viruses 
      acting together.

PG  - 927-33
LID - 10.1007/s00705-012-1249-3 [doi]
AB  - To evaluate the effect of natural infection with TTSuV1 on the antibody response to 
      vaccination with PRRS vaccine and clinical signs when co-infected with virulent 
      PRRSV, 15 4-week-old TTSuV1-positive piglets and 20 TTSuV1-negative piglets were 
      selected by PCR from two pig farms in Jiangsu province. TTSuV1-negative pigs were 
      divided into four groups, and TTSuV1-positive pigs were divided into three groups. 
      Experimental pigs were vaccinated with a PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) at 6 weeks 
      of age and subsequently challenged with a virulent strain of PRRSV at 10 weeks of 
      age. A TTSuV1-negative control group and an unvaccinated PRRS MLV control group were 
      tested at the same time. The levels of antibody/cytokine and protective efficiency 
      against PRRS MLV vaccine were evaluated. TTSuV1-infected/PRRSV-vaccinated pigs had 
      lower levels of PRRSV antibody, as well as IFN-γ, IL-10 and T lymphocyte 
      proliferation, than the TTSuV1-uninfected/PRRSV-vaccinated group (P < 0.05, except 
      IL-10) after vaccination at only one time point. TTSuV1-infected/PRRS 
      MLV-vaccinated/PRRSV-challenged pigs had more severe clinical signs (P > 0.05), more 
      macroscopic lung lesions (P < 0.05) and lower levels of PRRSV antibody (P < 0.05 at 
      7 to 14 days post-PRRSV-challenge) than 
      TTSuV1-uninfected/PRRSV-vaccinated/PRRSV-challenged pigs. These data indicate that 
      TTSuV1 natural infection has an adverse effect on the development of host immune 
      responses, suppresses immunization by the PRRS MLV vaccine, and exacerbates PRRS to 
      a certain extent in pigs.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV) were detected in the pig population in the Czech 
      Republic by a nested PCR technique. The prevalence of individual TTSuV was found to 
      be 42.9% (TTSuV1) and 46.7% (TTSuV2). The prevalence for TTSuV 1 and TTSuV2 was 
      determined to be 52.7% and 60.6% in piglets at weaning, 90.9% and 63.6% in gilts, 
      and 75% and 87.5% in sows, respectively. Both virus species were detected in 12% of 
      newborn piglets, which suggests possible transplacental transmission. Sequencing of 
      several virus strains showed that the sequenced TTSuV strains belong to two 
      different species of viruses. The average similarity on the nucleotide levels 
      between these two species was 43.3%.

TI  - Cloning and expression of N22 region of Torque Teno virus (TTV) genome and use of 
      peptide in developing immunoassay for TTV antibodies.
PG  - 96
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-11-96 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is a DNA virus with high rate of prevalence 
      globally. Since its discovery in 1997, several studies have questioned the role of 
      this virus in causing disease. However, it still remains an enigma. Although methods 
      are available for detection of TTV infection, there is still a need for simple, 
      rapid and reliable method for screening of this virus in human population. Present 
      investigation describes the cloning and expression of N22 region of TTV-genome and 
      the use of expressed peptide in development of immunoassay to detect anti-TTV 
      antibodies in serum. Since TTV genotype-1 is more common in India, the serum 
      positive for genotype-1 was used as source of N22 for expression purpose. METHODS: 
      Full length N22 region of ORF1 from TTV genotype-1 was amplified and cloned in 
      pGEM®-T Easy vector. After cloning, the amplicon was transformed and expressed as a 
      fusion protein containing hexa-histidine tag in pET-28a(+) vector using BL21 E. coli 
      cells as host. Expression was conducted both in LB medium as well as ZYP-5052 
      auto-induction medium. The expressed peptide was purified using metal-chelate 
      affinity chromatography and used as antigen in developing a blot immunoassay. 
      RESULTS: Analysis of translated product by SDS-PAGE and western blotting 
      demonstrated the presence of 25 kDa polypeptide produced after expression. 
      Solubility studies showed the polypeptide to be associated with insoluble fraction. 
      The use of this peptide as antigen in blot assay produced prominent spot on membrane 
      treated with sera from TTV-infected patients. Analysis of sera from 75 patients with 
      liver and renal diseases demonstrated a successful implication of N22 polypeptide 
      based immunoassay in screening sera for anti-TTV antibodies. Comparison of the 
      immunoassay developed using expressed N22 peptide with established PCR method for 
      TTV-DNA detection showed good coherence between TTV-DNA and presence of anti-TTV 
      antibodies in the sera analysed. CONCLUSIONS: This concludes that TTV N22 region may 
      be expressed and safely used as antigen for blot assay to detect anti-TTV antibodies 
      in sera.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small DNA viruses whose replication is 
      closely linked to immune status. A growing number of publications underlined the 
      potential of TTV viral load as an indicator of immunosuppression. OBJECTIVES: To 
      demonstrate the analytical performance of the first standardized RUO (Research Use 
      Only) assay to detect and quantify human TTV DNA in whole blood and plasma. STUDY 
      DESIGN: We established analytical performances for TTV load measurement in various 
      populations. The TTV kinetics were followed in kidney recipients. TTV viral load was 
      analyzed on whole blood samples from 42 kidney recipients follow-up, 53 kidney 
      deceased donors and 31 healthy volunteers. RESULTS: The qPCR TTV assay detects the 
      most prevalent human TTV genotypes and does not cross react with other viruses. 
      Limit of detection was 2.2 log(10) copies/mL in whole blood and plasma, linearity 
      and precision were demonstrated over the range 1.61 to 10.61 log(10) copies/mL in 
      whole blood. Prevalence of TTV DNA in blood differed significantly among groups: 45% 
      in healthy volunteers, 74% in donors and 83% in kidney recipients. In kidney 
      recipients, early TTV kinetics were comparable to those previously observed with 
      in-house assays in other transplant settings: viral load increased from an average 
      of 4.3 log(10) to 7.9 log(10) copies/mL within the first 75 days post 
      transplantation. CONCLUSION: This TTV assay showed high analytical sensitivity, 
      specificity, linearity and precision. It is a useful standardized tool to further 
      evaluate TTV load as a biomarker of immune status that could improve individual 
      treatment strategy.

AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to develop and to optimize molecular tools to 
      detect the presence of Torque teno virus (TTV) in swine and cattle. A novel 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a TaqMan probe was developed to 
      detect both genogroups of TTV strains. METHODS AND RESULTS: Oligonucleotide primers 
      and hybridization probes were designed based on sequence analysis of the noncoding 
      region, a highly conserved part of the genome. The real-time PCR assay specifically 
      detected bovine and porcine TTV DNA without cross-amplification of other common 
      pathogens. The assay was compared with conventional PCR and nested-PCR assays for 
      the detection of porcine genogroups 1 and 2 and bovine TTV on plasma and faecal 
      samples, and the assay was found faster, more reliable and reduced the risk of false 
      positive results. CONCLUSIONS: The real-time PCR assay provided better detection 
      results for the two TTV genogroups in both swine and cattle compared to the 
      conventional PCR assays. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This new TaqMan PCR 
      assay will be a useful tool for the detection of animal TTV strains, to evaluate the 
      viral load from animal host and finally to identify the presence of these viruses in 
      the agri-food continuum.

TI  - History of discoveries and pathogenicity of TT viruses.
PG  - 1-20
AB  - Since 1997, groups of novel nonenveloped DNA viruses with a circular, 
      single-stranded (negative sense) DNA genome of 3.6-3.9 kb, 3.2 kb, or 2.8-2.9 kb in 
      size have been discovered and designated Torque teno virus (TTV), Torque teno midi 
      virus (TTMDV), and Torque teno mini virus (TTMV), respectively, in the floating 
      genus Anellovirus. These three anelloviruses frequently and ubiquitously infect 
      humans, and the infections are characterized by lifelong viremia and great genetic 
      variability. Although TTV infection has been epidemiologically suggested to be 
      associated with many diseases including liver diseases, respiratory disorders, 
      hematological disorders, and cancer, there is no direct causal evidence for links 
      between TTV infection and specific clinical diseases. The pathogenetic role of TTMV 
      and TTMDV infections remains unknown. The changing ratio of the three anelloviruses 
      to each other over time, relative viral load, or combination of different 
      genotype(s) of each anellovirus may be associated with the pathogenicity or the 
      disease-inducing potential of these three human anelloviruses. To clarify their 
      disease association, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems for accurately 
      detecting, differentiating, and quantitating all of the genotypes and/or genogroups 
      of TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV should be established and standardized, as should methods to 
      detect past infections and immunological responses to anellovirus infections.

AB  - MS is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized 
      by demyelination, axonal damage and neurologic disability. The primary cause of this 
      CNS disease remains elusive. Here we will address our current understanding of the 
      role of viruses as potential environmental triggers for MS. Virus infections can act 
      peripherally (outside the CNS) or within the CNS. The association of viral 
      infections with demyelinating disease, in both animals and humans, will be 
      discussed, as will the potential contributions of peripheral infection with Torque 
      Teno virus, infection outside of and/or within the CNS with Epstein-Barr virus and 
      infection within the CNS with Human Herpesvirus 6 to MS. An experimental animal 
      model, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible strains of 
      mice is an example of viral infections of the CNS as a prerequisite for 
      demyelination. Finally, the proposition that multiple virus infections are required, 
      which first prime the immune system and then trigger the disease, as a model where 
      infections outside of the CNS lead to inflammatory changes within the CNS, for the 
      development of a MS-like disease is explored.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus type 1 (TTSuV1) ORF1 is considered to encode the viral capsid 
      (Cap) protein, which is crucial for the induction of TTSuV1-specific antibodies and 
      protective immunity in the host. Eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against 
      the Cap protein were generated and biologically characterized. The immunoreactivity 
      of the Cap protein expressed in transfected 293T cells for these mAbs was determined 
      with an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. The antigen epitopes of the Cap protein 
      were mapped using these mAbs and truncated Cap proteins expressed in Escherichia 
      coli. Fine epitope mapping was then performed with a panel of synthesized 
      polypeptides. All the mAbs reacted with the Cap protein C fragment expressed in E. 
      coli. One antigenic epitope of the Cap protein, which reacted with seven mAbs, had 
      the polypeptide sequence (536)HPKYAGQGGGYTT(548), whereas another epitope recognized 
      by the 1E9 mAb had the polypeptide sequence (549)EIGHQGITAASLR(561). It is 
      interesting that the two new epitopes are adjacent, but mutually independent. This 
      study should facilitate further investigation of the antigenic differences and 
      enable the differential diagnosis of the virus.

TI  - A multiplex PCR assay able to simultaneously detect Torque teno virus isolates from 
      phylogenetic groups 1 to 5.
PG  - 853-60
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular, single-stranded DNA virus that chronically 
      infects healthy individuals of all ages worldwide. TTV has an extreme genetic 
      heterogeneity which is reflected in its current classification into five main 
      phylogenetic groups (1-5). Using specific PCR assays, it has been shown that many 
      individuals are co-infected with TTV isolates belonging to different phylogenetic 
      groups. Here, a multiplex PCR assay was developed, using five recombinant plasmids. 
      Each plasmid carried an insert of different size issued from a TTV isolate belonging 
      to a different group. The assay was able to simultaneously amplify DNAs of TTV 
      isolates belonging to all five phylogenetic groups. Multiplex PCR was then tested 
      satisfactorily on DNAs extracted from 55 serum samples (47 health care workers and 8 
      AIDS patients). All individuals but nine were infected with at least one TTV 
      isolate. Co-infection with multiple isolates was found in 29/47 (62%) health care 
      workers and in 8/8 (100%) AIDS patients. A number of discrepancies were observed 
      when results obtained with three thermostable DNA polymerases were compared. For 
      example, four TTV phylogenetic groups were detected in a particular serum sample by 
      using one of the three DNA polymerases, whereas the other two enzymes were able to 
      detect only three TTV groups. However, none of the three enzymes used could be 
      broadly considered to be more efficient than the others. Despite its limitations, 
      the assay described here constitutes a suitable tool to visualize the degree of 
      co-infection of a given population, avoiding time-consuming experiments.

TI  - Multiple infection of porcine Torque teno virus in a single pig and characterization 
      of the full-length genomic sequences of four U.S. prototype PTTV strains: 
      implication for genotyping of PTTV.
PG  - 289-97
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2009.10.031 [doi]
AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (PTTV) was recently shown to partially contribute to the 
      experimental induction of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and 
      postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in pigs in the United States. We report 
      here the identification of four distinct full-length genomic sequences of PTTV 
      strains from a single pig in Virginia. Detailed analyses of the genomic 
      organization, the degree of variability and the characteristics of conserved 
      nucleotide and amino acid motifs of PTTV were conducted. The results showed that 
      these four prototype U.S. strains of PTTV identified from the same pig represent 
      distinct genotypes or subtypes and a revised classification system for PPTV is 
      subsequently proposed. This is the first study documenting multiple PTTV infections 
      with distinct genotypes or subtypes in a single pig. The identification of novel 
      PTTV strains from pigs in the United States also pave the way for future disease 
      characterization and genotyping of PTTV.

TI  - High-throughput sequencing exclusively identified a novel Torque teno virus genotype 
      in serum of a patient with fatal fever.
PG  - 112-8
LID - 10.1007/s12250-014-3424-z [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) has been found to be prevalent world-wide in healthy 
      populations and in patients with various diseases, but its etiological role has not 
      yet been determined. Using high-throughput unbiased sequencing to screen for viruses 
      in the serum of a patient with persistent high fever who died of suspected viral 
      infection and prolonged weakness, we identified the complete genome sequence of a 
      TTV (isolate Hebei-1). The genome of TTV-Hebei-1 is 3649 bp in length, encoding four 
      putative open reading frames, and it has a G+C content of 49%. Genomic comparison 
      and a BLASTN search revealed that the assembled genome of TTV-Hebei-1 represented a 
      novel isolate, with a genome sequence that was highly heterologous to the sequences 
      of other reported TTV strains. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the complete 
      genome sequence showed that TTV-Hebei-1 and an uncharacterized Taiwanese strain, 
      TW53A37, constitute a new TTV genotype. The patient was strongly suspected of 
      carrying a viral infection and died eventually without any other possible causes 
      being apparent. No virus other than the novel TTV was identified in his serum 
      sample. Although a direct causal link between the novel TTV genotype infection and 
      the patient's disease could not be confirmed, the findings suggest that surveillance 
      of this novel TTV genotype is necessary and that its role in disease deserves to be 
      explored.

TI  - Preliminary study of Porcine circovirus type 2 and Torque teno sus virus coinfection 
      frequencies in Brazilian pig herds.
PG  - 174-9
AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is emergent in swine herds. Recent studies have shown 
      an increased frequency of TTSuV2 in Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-associated 
      diseases (PCVAD), which are endemic in many swine-producing countries, including 
      Brazil. Coinfection with several other viral and bacterial agents results in an 
      increased incidence of more severe PCVAD. Given the limited information on TTSuV and 
      PCV2 coinfection, especially in Brazilian swine herds, this study made a preliminary 
      estimation of the occurrence of coinfection in swine herds by testing samples from 
      different categories. Between 2008 and 2009, 111 samples of feces and 23 serum 
      samples from 5 swine herds were tested for PCV2 and TTSuVs and the results analyzed 
      for associations between these agents. No significant differences in coinfection 
      frequency were observed for PCV2 + TTSuV1 or for PCV2 + TTSuV2 between nursery 
      piglets (P = 0.730), growing pigs (P = 0.331), or sows (P = 0.472). However, a 
      significant difference was observed for PCV2 + TTSuV1 + TTSuV2 between nursery 
      piglets and growing pigs (P = 0.004; Fisher's exact test). Phylogenetic studies 
      agreed with the grouping of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 into 2 different clades, with no 
      distinct pattern of clustering of these isolates with the animal categories.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), infecting domestic swine and wild boar, 
      is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. which has been 
      classified into the genera Iotatorquevirus (TTSuV1) and Kappatorquevirus (TTSuV2) of 
      the family Anelloviridae. A molecular study was conducted to detect evidence of a 
      phylogenic relationship between these two porcine TTSuV genogroups from the sera of 
      244 infected pigs located in 21 subordinate prefectures and/or cities of Sichuan. 
      RESULTS: Both genogroups of TTSuV were detected in pig sera collected from all 21 
      regions examined. Of the 244 samples, virus from either genogroup was detected in 
      203 (83.2%), while 44 animals (18.0%) were co-infected with viruses of both 
      genogroups. Moreover, TTSuV2 (186/244, 76.2%) was more prevalent than TTSuV1 
      (61/244, 25%). There was statistically significant difference between the prevalence 
      of genogroups 1 infection alone (9.4%, 23/244) and 2 alone (64.8%, 158/244), and 
      between the prevalence of genogroups 2 (76.2%, 186/244) and both genogroups 
      co-infection (18.0%, 44/244). The untranslated region of the swine TTSuV genome was 
      found to be an adequate molecular marker of the virus for detection and 
      surveillance. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both genogroups 1 and 2 could be 
      further divided into two subtypes, subtype a and b. TTSuV1 subtype b and the two 
      TTSuV2 subtypes are more prevalent in Sichuan Province. CONCLUSIONS: Our study 
      presents detailed geographical evidence of TTSuV infection in China.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are considered non-pathogenic viruses, although 
      lately they have been linked to porcine circovirus diseases, mainly with post 
      weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). These associations point out a 
      possible pathogenic role of TTSuVs or, alternatively, that TTSuV replication is 
      up-regulated under disease conditions. In order to further explore the association 
      of TTSuVs with disease occurrence, TTSuVs prevalence and viral load were assessed 
      before and after an experimental infection with a highly pathogenic classical swine 
      fever (CSF) virus (CSFV) isolate. Serum samples from 56 animals were analyzed by 
      means of a real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 before and after 
      (between 6 and 13 days post-inoculation) the CSFV challenge. Based on the 
      post-infection clinical evolution and immune response against CSFV, the animals were 
      divided into two groups: group I, with protecting immunity against CSFV and no 
      clinical signs at the day of necropsy, and group II, with no detectable immune 
      response against CSFV and moderate to severe clinical signs. TTSuVs qPCR results 
      indicated that TTSuV2 and not TTSuV1 load in serum increased significantly after 
      challenge with CSFV in the group of pigs with clinical signs, specifically in those 
      with a moderate course of the disease. Therefore, this study emphasizes the 
      different behaviour of both TTSuVs, as already found in the PMWS background, and 
      further supports the association of TTSuV2 with disease occurrence.

TI  - Viral metagenomic analysis of bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus) in Uganda identifies 
      novel variants of Porcine parvovirus 4 and Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2.
PG  - 192

AB  - BACKGROUND: As a result of rapidly growing human populations, intensification of 
      livestock production and increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal 
      agriculture, the interface between wildlife, livestock and humans is expanding, with 
      potential impacts on both domestic animal and human health. Wild animals serve as 
      reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of 
      domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used 
      metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from 
      bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move 
      between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. RESULTS: Application of 454 
      pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine 
      parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like 
      virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the 
      bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing 
      revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum 
      samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses 
      present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in 
      a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in 
      bushpigs.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV1-2), members of the newly established family 
      Anelloviridae are considered non-pathogenic emerging viral agents of Suidae species. 
      However, the genetic diversity, phylogeny and evolutionary processes responsible for 
      the emergence and spread of TTSuVs in wild boars remain poorly understood. Here we 
      implemented phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses to address key questions on the 
      genetic diversity, evolutionary scenario and spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging 
      TTSuVs in wild boars of the Western region (Transylvania) of Romania. High levels of 
      genetic diversity of wild boar origin TTSuV1-2 have been found as well as a new 
      TTSuV1 genotype and several new subtypes. Phylogenies suggest that several wild boar 
      viral strains in both TTSuV species are likely to have emerged from a well-defined 
      ancestor approximately 40 (TTSuV1) and 18 (TTSuV2) years ago and showed independent 
      evolutionary trajectories. Bayesian phylogeography showed an intense flow of viral 
      strains throughout the Transylvanian counties possibly related to wild host 
      migrations, facilitating the rapid spread of TTSuVs. The intra-genotype and inter- 
      and intrahost level recombination, intense spatio-temporal viral flow and the 
      positively selected sites found in the ORF2 genes should be considered important 
      driving forces shaping TTSuVs evolution. The first reported rates of nucleotide 
      substitution for porcine anelloviruses, estimated to be 5.29-5.51 × 10(-4)subs 
      site(-1)year(-1), are in line with those measured previously for mammalian ssDNA 
      viruses and RNA viruses. These high evolutionary rates of TTSuVs, independent of 
      recombination, are reflections of adaptive evolution, an important factor in the 
      emergence of novel viral variants which may explain their ability to emerge in 
      Suidae hosts.

TI  - Clinical outcome of frequent exposure to Torque Teno virus (TTV) through blood 
      transfusion in thalassemia patients with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      infection.
PG  - 365-71
AB  - As a consequence of the high prevalence of TorqueTeno virus (TTV) in blood donors, 
      thalassemia patients frequently acquire various genotypes of this virus through 
      therapeutic blood transfusions. At present, the clinical consequences of TTV 
      infection remain indeterminate for these patients. Here, several hundred thalassemia 
      patients were tested for the presence of TTV and its genotypes using a combination 
      of PCR and clone-based DNA sequencing. Approximately 10% (12/118) of the patients 
      aged 2-20 years remained negative for TTV including eight genotypes of SENV. 
      Ferritin, aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) and alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) levels 
      were invariably lower in TTV-negative patients (P = 0.02, <0.01, and 0.06, 
      respectively) than in TTV-positive patients. Patients with TTV-HCV co-infection 
      showed elevated ferritin and ALT levels compared with patients with TTV infection 
      alone (P < 0.02 and P < 0.01). AST and ALT levels were within the normal range for 
      all TTV-negative patients, whereas abnormal levels of AST and ALT were seen in a 
      significant proportion of TTV-positive patients (30.7% and 33.6%, respectively) and 
      patients with TTV-HCV co-infections (70.0% and 56.6%, respectively). Only 
      TTV-positive patients (28.0%) and patients with TTV-HCV co-infections (36.3%) had 
      hyper-ferritin levels (> or =3,000 ng/ml). The genotype(s) of TTV responsible for 
      the liver dysfunction could not be determined. However, high levels of AST and ALT 
      were found to be correlated with detection of a higher number of TTV genotypes in 
      the patients. The data suggests that frequent and persistent TTV infection through 
      blood transfusion is associated with hepatic dysfunction and/or damage in 
      transfusion dependent thalassemia patients.

TI  - Expression of the putative ORF1 capsid protein of Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) 
      and development of Western blot and ELISA serodiagnostic assays: correlation between 
      TTSuV2 viral load and IgG antibody level in pigs.

AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV) has a single-stranded circular DNA genome and is 
      currently classified into a new genus Iotatorquevirus with two species in a newly 
      established family Anelloviridae. Viral DNA of both porcine TTV species (TTSuV1 and 
      TTSuV2) has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and 
      multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species 
      has been documented in the United States and in Europe. However, the prevalence of 
      specific TTSuV antibodies in pigs remains unknown. In this study, the putative ORF1 
      capsid protein from TTSuV2 isolate PTTV2c-VA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The 
      purified recombinant ORF1 protein was used as the antigen for the development of 
      Western blot and indirect ELISA to detect TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies in pig 
      sera. The results revealed a relatively high rate of seropositivity to TTSuV2 in 
      conventional pigs from different sources but not in gnotobiotic pigs. Overall, pigs 
      with undetectable TTSuV2 viral load were more likely to have a lower anti-TTSuV2 
      antibody level. An analysis of 10 conventional pigs during a 2-month period showed 
      that decreased viral loads or presumed virus clearance were associated with elevated 
      anti-ORF1 IgG antibody levels. Interestingly, porcine circovirus associated disease 
      (PCVAD)-affected pigs had a significantly lower level of TTSuV2 antibody than 
      PCVAD-unaffected pigs (p<0.01). This is the first study to establish essential 
      serodiagnostic tools for investigation of TTSuV seroprevalence and infection 
      dynamics, which will help elucidate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV infection 
      in pigs.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are widespread in humans, swine as well as in several 
      other animal species. In market ready swine, the reported prevalence ranges between 
      11% and 100%. Through a national retail sampling plan from the Canadian Integrated 
      Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) program, 283 and 599 
      liver and pork chop samples, respectively, were collected over a 12-month period 
      from commercial establishments in 5 selected geographical regions of Canada to 
      assess the presence of Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) in these products. TTSuVs 
      were detected in 97.9% of pork chops with viral loads ranging between 1×10(4) and 
      9.9×10(5) genomic copies (gc)/g and 98.6% of liver samples with viral loads ranging 
      from 1×10(5) to 9.9×10(6) gc/g. A selection of 20 positive samples (10 pork chop and 
      10 liver) from the 5 geographical regions were further tested for the production, of 
      a 305bp fragment for TTSuV1 and a 253bp fragment for TTSuV2 in the non-coding 
      region. TTSuV1 was present in all 10 liver and 10 pork chops samples while TTSuV2 
      was detected in 10 liver and 9 pork chop samples. Two different TTSuV1 sequences 
      were simultaneously detected from 5 of 20 samples and 2 different TTSuV2 sequences 
      were detected from 6 of 19 samples. The omnipresence of TTSuVs in commercial pork 
      samples may allow its use as a viral indicator to monitor the effectiveness of 
      cleaning and disinfecting process in slaughtering, cutting, slicing and packaging 
      facilities.

TI  - Apoptosis-inducing proteins in chicken anemia virus and TT virus.
PG  - 131-49
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) share several genomic similarities with the chicken 
      anemia virus (CAV). CAV encodes the protein apoptin that specifically induces 
      apoptosis in (human) tumor cells. Functional studies reveal that apoptin induces 
      apoptosis in a very broad range of (human) tumor cells. A putative TTV open reading 
      frame (ORF) in TTV genotype 1, named TTV apoptosis inducing protein (TAIP), it 
      induces, like apoptin, p53-independent apoptosis in various human hepatocarcinoma 
      cell lines to a similar level as apoptin. In comparison to apoptin, TAIP action is 
      less pronounced in several analyzed human non-hepatocarcinoma-derived cell lines. 
      Detailed sequence analysis has revealed that the TAIP ORF is conserved within a 
      limited group of the heterogeneous TTV population. However, its N-terminal half, 
      N-TAIP, is rather well conserved in a much broader set of TTV isolates. The 
      similarities between apoptin and TAIP, and their relevance for the development and 
      treatment of diseases is discussed.

PG  - 95-101
AB  - TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) represent the first described human 
      circoviruses. They do not show significant sequence homology with any other animal 
      circovirus identified to date. They are both detected with high prevalences in 
      various body fluids. The spread mode may include the parenteral way, the 
      transmission by saliva droplets and the fecal-oral route. Genetic variability within 
      a viral group is high and the co-infection by distinct viral strains is common in a 
      given individual. The description of several messenger RNAs obtained after multiple 
      splicing revealed a specific transcription profile. Despite apparent asymptomatic 
      infections, the possible association of variants of TTV and TLMV with a given 
      pathology cannot be formally ruled out.

TI  - Non-A to E hepatitis.
PG  - 529-34
AB  - PURPOSE OF THE REVIEW: The list of possible hepatotropic viruses continues to grow 
      with the discovery of the GB virus-C, the TT virus and the SEN virus. There is 
      emerging data on the biology of these newly discovered :In spite of continuing 
      research into the pathogenicity of the GB virus-C and the TT virus, definite 
      evidence linking them to acute or chronic liver disease is lacking. The SEN virus 
      was reported in 2000, and although there seems to be an association between virus 
      and transfusion-related hepatitis, more data are awaited before definite conclusions 
      can be drawn. The effect of GB virus-C, the TT virus and the SEN virus co-infection 
      on other viral and non-viral hepatitides has also been studied in some detail. 
      Again, there is no definite evidence so far that these viruses modify other liver 
      diseases. SUMMARY: At the present time, diagnostic testing for these viruses does 
      not seem to be warranted outside of clinical studies. The discovery of these 
      viruses, however, paves the way for further research into novel viral agents that 
      infect humans, other among hosts.

TI  - Analysis of synonymous codon usage patterns in torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1).
PG  - 145-54
LID - 10.1007/s00705-012-1480-y [doi]
AB  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) is a novel virus that has been found widely 
      distributed in the swine population in recent years. Analysis of codon usage can 
      reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon 
      usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available 
      complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide 
      content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we 
      found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C 
      nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and 
      these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a 
      variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias 
      and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by 
      the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons 
      (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that 
      the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly 
      and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation analysis 
      and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in 
      determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the 
      evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results 
      suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of 
      interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from 
      this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage 
      pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage 
      by this virus.

AB  - Recent studies on the torque teno virus (TTV), genus Anellovirus, have allowed 
      formulating the hypothesis that TTV may trigger autoimmune rheumatic diseases or 
      have some pathogenic role in them. OBJECTIVES: To determine the frequency of TTV 
      infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the genetic diversity 
      of TTV, the correlation between TTV infection and SLE clinical manifestations, and 
      SLE clinical course and serological profile. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serum samples 
      were obtained from 46 SLE patients treated at the University-Affiliated Hospital of 
      Campo Grande (NHU/FAMED/UFMS), Brazil. For controls, serum samples were obtained 
      from 46 healthy volunteer blood donors. Viral DNA was extracted from samples using 
      the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and amplified using nested 
      PCR. RESULTS: Positivity for TTV was found in 17 (37%) of SLE patients and in only 
      seven (15.2%) of the controls (z test, P = 0.03). There was no correlation between 
      TTV infection, SLE clinical manifestations, SLE clinical course, and the serological 
      profile of the patients evaluated. CONCLUSION: Further studies on the presence of 
      TTV in SLE patients are required.

TI  - Antigenic diversity and seroprevalences of Torque teno viruses in children and 
      adults by ORF2-based immunoassays.
PG  - 409-417
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.046862-0 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) circulate widely among humans, causing persistent 
      viraemia in healthy individuals. Numerous TTV isolates with high genetic variability 
      have been identified and segregated into 29 species of five major phylogenetic 
      groups. To date, the diversity of TTV sequences, challenges in protein expression 
      and the subsequent lack of serological assays have hampered TTV seroprevalence 
      studies. Moreover, the antigenic relationships of different TTVs and their specific 
      seroprevalences in humans remain unknown. For five TTV strains--belonging to 
      different species of four genogroups--we developed, using recombinant glutathione 
      S-transferase (GST)-fused TTV ORF2 proteins, glutathione-GST capture enzyme 
      immunoassays (EIAs) detecting antibodies towards conformational epitopes. We then 
      analysed serum samples from 178 healthy adults and 108 children; IgG reactivities 
      were observed either towards a single strain or towards multiple strains, which 
      pointed to antigenic distinction of TTV species. The overall seroprevalence for the 
      five TTVs peaked at 43 % (18 of 42) in children 2-4 years of age, subsequently 
      declined, and again reached 42 % (74 of 178) among adults. TTV6 species-specific IgG 
      predominated in children, whereas that for TTV13 predominated in adults. During a 3 
      year follow-up of the same children, both species-specific seroconversions and 
      seroreversions occurred. This is the first EIA-based study of different TTVs, 
      providing a new approach for seroepidemiology and diagnosis of TTV infections. Our 
      data suggest that different TTVs in humans may differ in antiviral antibody 
      profiles, infection patterns and epidemiology.

AB  - The host cells and the events in the cells during Torque teno (TT) virus infection 
      are at present unknown. Replicating TT virus DNA has been detected in liver, in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and in bone marrow. By alternative 
      splicing this small virus generates three mRNA species, from which by alternative 
      translation initiation at least six proteins are produced. The functions of the 
      proteins are not yet fully understood. However, functions associated with, e.g., DNA 
      replication, immunomodulation, and apoptosis have been suggested to reside in the 
      multifunctional proteins of anelloviruses.

TI  - TT viruses: oncogenic or tumor-suppressive properties?
PG  - 109-16
AB  - Torque teno (TT) viruses have been more frequently reported in malignant biopsies 
      when compared to normal control tissue. The possible contribution of TT virus 
      infection to human carcinogenesis or the potential oncolytic functions of these 
      virus infections are being discussed based on available experimental evidence. The 
      data could suggest an involvement of TT virus infections as an indirect carcinogen 
      by modulating T cell immune responses. Significant oncolytic functions, potentially 
      mediated by the inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB transcription factor or by 
      apoptin-like gene activities, are emerging to be less likely.

TI  - Simultaneous infection with distinct strains of torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in 
      healthy slaughter-age pigs.
PG  - 183-6

AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infection in 
      healthy slaughter-age pigs and to compare the similarities of the untranslated 
      region (UTR) nucleotide (nt) sequences obtained from different biological samples of 
      the same animals. Fifty-eight pigs were evaluated by PCR assay for the presence of 
      TTSuV in paired samples of liver and serum (Group 1, n = 27) and lung and serum 
      (Group 2, n = 31). All the pigs were positive for TTSuV infection in the organs 
      sampled and 94.8 % (n = 55) presented with viraemia. The nt sequence similarities 
      between the Groups 1 and 2 varied from 91.7 % to 96.6 % (TTSuV1) and 91 % to 95 % 
      (TTSuV2). In Group 1, the nt sequence similarities were 93 % (TTSuV1) and 95.4 % 
      (TTSuV2). In Group 2, the nt sequence similarities were 95 % (TTSuV1) and 91 % 
      (TTSuV2). These results revealed the simultaneous infection with distinct strains of 
      TTSuV1 and 2 in healthy pigs at slaughter age.

TI  - Searching for foreign antigens as possible triggering factors of autoimmunity: 
      Torque Teno virus DNA prevalence is elevated in sera of patients with bullous 
      pemphigoid.
PG  - 446-54
LID - 10.1111/j.1600-0625.2007.00663.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The Torque Teno virus (TTV), a member of virus genus Anellovirus has been 
      shown to be commonly present in humans, yet without detectable pathogenicity. Recent 
      studies imply that TTV may contribute to provoke autoimmune progresses in systemic 
      lupus erythematosus and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. We aimed to study the 
      presence of TTV in a group of patients with autoimmune bullous diseases with a 
      further goal to identify long-lasting foreign antigen, such as TTV as possible 
      triggers of skin-specific autoimmunity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed in silico 
      research to study similarities between known TTV sequences and antigens of bullous 
      pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Basic 
      Local Alignment Search Tool results showed matching regions for the major BP 
      antigens BP180 and BP230, PV antigen desmoglein 3 and DH antigen transglutaminase 3 
      and disclosed overlapping, antigen-predicted sequences only for BP180 regions. We 
      also assessed the prevalence of TTV in these disorders and compared them with the 
      results from two healthy blood donor groups (group 1: sex- and age-matched for the 
      general bullous group, n = 95; group 2: sex- and age-matched for BP, n = 50). 
      Furthermore, we assayed lymphocytes from four TTV DNA and BP180 NC16A blot-positive 
      BP patients and three controls in a standard lymphocyte transformation test with a 
      TTV peptide from the conserved ORF(Open Reading Frame)1/N22 region. RESULTS: We 
      found that the detection rate of TTV was comparable with that in healthy controls in 
      the group of PV (19/33); whereas detection rates in DH showed a slight, but not 
      significant tendency for elevation (17/20). Contrary, the TTV prevalence in BP 
      patients was significantly elevated (group 1: 36/40 vs group 2: 31/50, P < 0.032). 
      Lymphocytes from all four virus-positive BP patients heavily reacted to TTV peptide 
      while two of the three healthy controls have shown not to recognize the viral 
      sequences. Only the TTV carrier healthy control had a minor reaction at lowest 
      peptide concentration. The combined in silico, polymerse chain reaction and in vitro 
      cell assay data of the present study indicate that a TTV persistence may contribute 
      to the pathogenesis of BP.

TI  - Prevalence and genotyping of group 3 torque teno viruses detected in health care 
      workers in Hungary.
PG  - 39-45
LID - 10.1007/s11262-009-0369-7 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are classified into the Anellovirus genus of the 
      Circoviridae family. In addition to TTV isolates, TTV genogroup 3 also includes the 
      8 virus strains known as SENV-A to H. In this study, the prevalence of TTV group 3 
      viruses and that of SENV-D and H in particular were determined among the staff of a 
      hospital in Budapest. Viruses were genotyped using type-specific PCR primers and by 
      cloning and sequencing of PCR products. Frequency of infection with TTV group 3 was 
      high among both the hospital staff and the control group. Prevalence of SENV-H was 
      similar in the two groups, but SENV-D infection was significantly more common in the 
      study group than in controls. Sequencing of PCR products showed that viruses closely 
      related to isolate TUS01 are common in Hungary. Several sequences could not be 
      genotyped and may represent a previously undescribed genotype within the genogroup. 
      TTV group 3 sequences detected in the serum samples of a symptomless health care 
      worker were followed-up for 15 years. Some strains persisted for up to 10 years, 
      while others caused transient infections and could be detected in only one of the 
      samples. Results showed that TTV infection, superinfection, and viral clearance 
      often occur over the years without apparent symptoms.

TI  - Three new emerging subgroups of Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) and co-infection of 
      TTSuVs with porcine circovirus type 2 in China.
PG  - 189

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are non-enveloped viruses and have 
      single-stranded, negative sense circular DNA genomes and are widely distributed in 
      pigs. But till now, the prevalence of TTSuVs with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) 
      in pig herds of China is not very clear; and the genetic variation among different 
      TTSuVs isolate is very large and need to divide the subgroups. In this study, the 
      co-infection with TTSuVs and porcine circovrius (PCV) in the pig population of China 
      was investigated and the subgroups of all TTSuVs genomes in Genbank were divided. 
      RESULTS: Results showed that the rate of co-infection with TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 reached 
      75% in PCV2-positive samples. Also Two TTSuV1 and four TTSuV2 isolates genome 
      sequences were obtained, and the similarity of all TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomic 
      sequences in GenBank were compared. Phylogenetic trees indicated that both the 
      TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 sequences could be divided into four genotypes. Interestingly, the 
      sub-genotypes TTSuV1d, TTSuV2c and TTSuV2d exist only in the pig population of 
      China. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that co-infection with TTSuVs and PCVs 
      is very common in the pig population of China, in which the viruses maybe contribute 
      to clinical diseases cooperatively. In addition, three new subgroups of TTSuVs 
      emerged in China for the first time and a high level of variation among different 
      isolates of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was indicated by their genetic diversity.

TI  - Retrospective study on swine Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2 infection from 
      1985 to 2005 in Spain.
PG  - 199-207
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2008.08.002 [doi]
AB  - A retrospective study to detect evidence of swine Torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 
      1 and 2 infection in sera of pigs from the Spanish livestock between years 1985 and 
      2005 was carried out by means of PCR. Also, the molecular evolution of TTV 
      genogroups 1 and 2 during the 20-year period studied using a 250-base sequence of 
      the non-coding region of the viral genome was assessed. Both TTV genogroup genomes 
      were found in pig sera from the first year of study. Taking into account the whole 
      study period, 113 out of 162 animals (69.8%) were infected with one or the other 
      genogroup, while 38 out of 162 pigs (23.5%) were co-infected with both genogroups. 
      Moreover, TTV genogroup 2 (90 out of 162, 55.6%) was significantly more prevalent 
      than genogroup 1 (54 out of 162, 33.3%). The non-coding region of swine TTV genome 
      sequenced showed its adequacy as a molecular marker in swine TTV. This study 
      represents the earliest evidence of TTV infection in pigs to date, 14 years before 
      the initial description of this virus. Moreover, this is also the earliest evidence 
      of TTV infection in any species.

TI  - Transfusion transmitted virus: A review on its molecular characteristics and role in 
      medicine.
PG  - 5122-34
AB  - The present review gives an updated overview of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), 
      a novel agent, in relation to its molecular characteristics, epidemiological 
      features, modes of transmission, tissue tropism, pathogenesis, role in various 
      diseases and its eradication from the body. TTV, a DNA virus, is a single stranded, 
      non-enveloped, 3.8 kb long DNA virus with a small and covalently closed circular 
      genome comprising 3852 bases. It was tentatively designated Circinoviridae virus. 
      TTV genome sequence is heterogeneous and reveals the existence of six different 
      genotypes and several subtypes. TTV has been reported to transmit not only via 
      parenteral routes, but also via alternate routes. This virus has been detected in 
      different non-human primates as well. At present, TTV is detected by polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) with no other available diagnostic assays. It shows its 
      presence globally and was detected in high percent populations of healthy persons as 
      well as in various disease groups. Initially it was supposed to have strong 
      association with liver disease; however, there is little evidence to show its liver 
      tropism and contribution in causing liver diseases. It shows high prevalence in 
      hemodialysis patients, pointing towards its significance in renal diseases. In 
      addition, TTV is associated with several infectious and non-infectious diseases. 
      Though, its exact pathogenesis is not yet clear, TTV virus possibly resides and 
      multiplies in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). 
      Recently, attempts have been made to eradicate this virus with interferon treatment. 
      More information is still needed to extricate various mysteries related to TTV.

TI  - Potential implication of new torque teno mini viruses in parapneumonic empyema in 
      children.
PG  - 470-9
LID - 10.1183/09031936.00107212 [doi]
AB  - An unexplained increase in the incidence of parapneumonic empyema (PPE) in pneumonia 
      cases has been reported in recent years. The present study investigated the genetic 
      and biological specifications of new isolates of torque teno mini virus (TTMV) 
      detected in pleural effusion samples from children hospitalised for severe pneumonia 
      with PPE. A pathogen discovery protocol was applied in undiagnosed pleural effusion 
      samples and led to the identification of three new isolates of TTMV (TTMV-LY). 
      Isolated TTMV-LY genomes were transfected into A549 and human embryonic kidney 293T 
      cells and viral replication was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and 
      full-length genome amplification. A549 cells were further infected with released 
      TTMV-LY virions and the induced-innate immune response was measured by multiplex 
      immunoassays. Genetic analyses of the three TTMV-LY genomes revealed a classic 
      genomic organisation but a weak identity (<64%) with known sequences. We 
      demonstrated the in vitro replication of TTMV-LY in alveolar epithelial cells and 
      the effective release of infectious viral particles. We also showed a selective 
      production of inflammatory mediators in response to TTMV infection. This study 
      reports the description of replicative TTMV-LY isolated from parapneumonic effusions 
      of children hospitalised with PPE, suggesting a potential role of the virus in the 
      pathogenesis of pneumonia.

AB  - AIMS: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a human DNA virus chronically infecting most 
      healthy individuals worldwide and can be transmitted by faecal-oral route. The 
      occurrence of TTV was evaluated in the streams crossing the city of Manaus 
      (Brazilian Amazon) over a 1-year period, four times a year. METHODS AND RESULTS: 
      Fifty-two water samples were collected from 13 different locations. Viruses were 
      concentrated from two litres of water by adsorption to negative membrane filters 
      followed by ultrafiltration. TTV DNA was detected by PCR assays designed to detect 
      all five TTV genomic groups. By conventional PCR, 19/52 (37%) samples were positive. 
      By real-time PCR, TTV DNA could be detected in 48/52 (92%) samples. Viral loads 
      ranged from 1300 to 746 000 genome equivalent per 100 ml of river water. Eleven 
      distinct nucleotide sequences were obtained. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the wide 
      distribution and diversity of TTV among Manaus urban micro basins. SIGNIFICANCE AND 
      IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The data presented here may contribute to substantiate TTV as a 
      sensitive indicator of human contamination.

      reaction. High seroprevalence rate of TTSuVs was observed in both PMWS-suspected 
      pigs (100%) and PCV2-vaccinated normal pigs (90.7%). The seroprevalence rate of 
      TTSuV2 was significantly higher in the PMWS-suspected pigs than in PCV2-vaccinated 
      normal pigs (97.4% versus 81.4%, P<0.05), whereas no such difference was observed 
      for TTSuV1 between the 2 groups of pigs. In both pig groups, the seroprevalence rate 
      of TTSuV2 was significantly higher than that of TTSuV1 (P<0.01-0.05). These results 
      show that TTSuVs are highly seroprevalent in both PMWS-suspected pigs and 
      PCV2-vaccinated normal pigs with TTSuV2 being more seroprevalent in the former than 
      in the latter.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is responsible for the infection of pig herds around 
      the world. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of natural infection by 
      both species of TTSuV in suckling piglets from major pig-producing regions of 
      Brazil. Faecal samples (n = 135) from 1 to 3-week-old suckling piglets from the 
      Southern, Southeast and Midwest regions of Brazil were analysed by PCR assay to 
      detect TTSuV1 and 2. TTSuV1 and 2 DNA was identified in 65 (48.1 %) and 23 (17 %) of 
      piglet faecal samples, respectively. Co-infection by both species of TTSuV was 
      detected in 17 (12.6 %) samples. Detection of TTSuV1 was significantly higher than 
      that of TTSuV2 in the three Brazilian regions together (p < 0.05). Based on age of 
      animals, TTSuV1 infection was statistically higher than TTSuV2 in each age group (p 
      < 0.05). For all of the age groups together, no statistical difference was detected 
      in the number of TTSuV1 and 2 positive results (p > 0.05). These findings revealed 
      that TTSuV infection has disseminated in pig herds from different geographic 
      Brazilian regions, and the presence of TTSuV in suckling piglet faecal samples 
      suggested the early infection by the virus and the potential of these animals in 
      spreading the virus.

      each farm were given a commercial vaccine against PCV2 (vaccinated group), and the 
      remaining piglets were used as a control group (non-vaccinated group). An early 
      onset and a chronic viremic state of TTSuV genogroups were present regardless of the 
      PCV2 infection, and there were no significant differences in the dynamics of TTSuV 
      genogroups.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV, family Anelloviridae) cause long lasting and 
      persistent infection in pigs under subclinical scenarios, and are potentially linked 
      to several economically important swine diseases. Currently, little is known about 
      swine immune response against TTSuV infections. In this study, an ELISA assay was 
      developed based on the ORF1-A recombinant protein of two known TTSuVs, namely TTSuV1 
      (genus Iotatorquevirus) and TTSuV2 (genus Kappatorquevirus). The assay was used to 
      study the development of the humoral immune response against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in 
      longitudinally sampled clinically healthy pigs and their dams. Anti ORF1-A IgG was 
      found in serum of pigs and sows for both TTSuVs. From 15 sows, 15 (100%) and 13 
      (83%) had anti ORF1-A IgG against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. Pig 
      sero-prevalences at the first sampling (4 weeks of age) were 65% (24/37) and 5% 
      (2/37) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. For TTSuV1, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG 
      prevalence was observed at weeks 21 and 25, with 68% (25/37) sero-positive pigs. 
      Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results at week 21 revealed that 26 out of 32 (81%) pigs 
      were positive for TTSuV1. In the case of TTSuV2, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG 
      prevalence was observed at week 21, with 84% (31/37) pigs being sero-positive. At 
      the same week, 92% (34/37) of pigs were qPCR positive. In summary, anti ORF1-A IgGs 
      were detected in both sows and piglets at different ages, indicating that these 
      animals could mount a humoral immune response against both TTSuVs. However, the high 
      percentage of viremic pigs in presence of anti ORF1-A IgG suggests that these 
      antibodies are not able to remove TTSuVs from circulation.

TI  - Classification of TTV and related viruses (anelloviruses).
PG  - 21-33
AB  - Ten years after the identification of the first partial sequences of Torque teno 
      virus (TTV), more than 200 full-length related genomes have been characterized in 
      humans and in several animal species. As suspected in the earlier stages of their 
      description, a considerable genetic variability characterizes TTV and related 
      viruses, the current members of the floating genus Anellovirous. Since information 
      related to anelloviruses diversity is in constant evolution, the challenge in their 
      taxonomic classification is to take into account all pertinent parameters, along 
      with the taxonomic situation of other viruses having circular single-stranded DNA 
      genomes. Past, present and future phylogenetic and taxonomic considerations are 
      exposed.

      disease.
PG  - 91-107
AB  - A role for the ubiquitous Torque teno (TT) viruses in the pathogenesis of disease 
      has not been resolved. In vivo and in vitro intragenomic rearrangement of TT virus 
      genomes has been demonstrated. Replication in cell culture of a subviral molecule 
      (411 bp) occurs through oligomerisation of RNA transcripts. Although the functions 
      of the respective TT viral genes, as well as the newly formed genes in the 
      rearranged subviral molecules, are largely unknown, certain similarities to genes of 
      plant viruses of the family Geminiviridae will be described. A degree of similarity 
      to certain cellular genes poses the question as to a role of molecular mimicry in 
      the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and diabetes.

TI  - First description of swine Torque teno virus (TTV) and detection of a new genogroup 
      in Hungary: short communication.
PG  - 547-53
LID - 10.1556/AVet.56.2008.4.12 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) belongs to the floating genus of Anellovirus. It was 
      discovered in a human patient, and later it was also found in animals including 
      pigs. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and estimate the 
      prevalence of swine TTV in Hungarian pig herds for the first time, and to 
      characterise the viruses found. Serum samples of 82 adult swine from 13 piggeries 
      and 44 weaned pigs from one large herd were tested by PCR for the presence of TTV 
      DNA. Viral DNA was found in 30% of the adult swine and 73% of the weaned pigs 
      tested. Liver and intestine of weaned pigs were also tested and found to be infected 
      at a lower rate. The TTV sequences found in sera and intestines were similar and 
      could be clustered as swine genogroup 1. However, the sequences derived from one 
      liver were remarkably different from all other known genogroups and seemed to 
      represent a new genogroup.

TI  - TT virus. A review of the literature.
PG  - 167-77
AB  - In 1997, a new DNA virus was cloned by a Japanese team and designated TT virus 
      (TTV). This virus seemed to be associated with non-A, non-G post-transfusion 
      hepatitis. It was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was presumed to be 
      human Circoviridae. The virus is heterogenous; 16 different genotypes are currently 
      registered, and it can be classified as a "swarm" of at least 5 different viruses. 
      Depending on the PCR technique used, the prevalence of infection ranges from 1.9 to 
      36% among blood donors, from 11.5 to 71% in hemodialysis patients, from 47 to 82% 
      among patients with non-A, non-B or non-C fulminant hepatic failure, and the most 
      elevated percentage is found in hemophiliacs. Epidemiological studies have 
      established that the routes of TTV infection might be parenteral, oral-fecal, and 
      possibly salivary. Mother-to-infant transmission is controversial. TTV may play a 
      role in the pathogenesis of non-A, non-B or non-C fulminant hepatic failure. 
      Patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TTV have a significantly 
      higher histological grade score than patients with isolated HCV infection. Treatment 
      with interferon seems to decrease TT viremia, according to results obtained outside 
      the context of clinical trials. TTV seems to be a light pathogenic virus. Its 
      widespread presence in the blood of infected subjects contrasts with the apparent 
      absence of pathological symptoms. PCR standardization is needed to clearly establish 
      its real prevalence worldwide.

TI  - Globalisation and global trade influence molecular viral population genetics of 
      Torque Teno Sus Viruses 1 and 2 in pigs.
PG  - 81-7
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.10.026 [doi]
AB  - Globalisation, in terms of the rapid and free movement of people, animals and food, 
      has created a new paradigm, increasing the range and rate of distribution of many 
      pathogens. In the present study, Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) have been used as 
      a model to evaluate the effects of global trade on viral heterogeneity, and how the 
      movement of live pigs can affect the distribution and composition of virus 
      populations. Seventeen countries from different parts of the world have been 
      screened for TTSuV1 and TTSuvV2. High levels of genetic diversity have been found as 
      well as two new TTSuV subtypes. A small fraction of this diversity (<5%) was related 
      with spatial structure; however the majority (>50%) was best explained by the 
      exchange of live pigs among countries, pointing to the direct relationship between 
      the movement of hosts and the diversity of their accompanying viruses. Taking TTSuVs 
      as sentinels, this study revealed that the distribution and diversity of comensal 
      microflora in live animals subjected to global trade is shaped by the commercial 
      movements among countries. In the case of TTSuVs, it appears that commercial 
      movements of animals are eroding the genetic composition of the virus populations 
      that may have been present in pig herds since their domestication.

AB  - While recent findings suggest that swine TTVs (TTSuVs) can act as primary or 
      co-infecting pathogens, very little is known about viral immunity. To determine 
      whether TTSuVs downregulate key host immune responses to facilitate their own 
      survival, a swine macrophage cell line, 3D4/31, was used to over-express recombinant 
      TTSuV1 viral particles or the ORF3 protein. Immune gene expression profiles were 
      assessed by a quantitative PCR panel consisting of 22 immune genes, in cell samples 
      collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48h post-transfection. Despite the upregulation of IFN-β 
      and TLR9, interferon stimulated innate genes and pro-inflammatory genes were not 
      upregulated in virally infected cells. The adaptive immune genes, IL-4 and IL-13, 
      were significantly downregulated at 6h post-transfection. The ORF3 protein did not 
      appear do not have a major immuno-suppressive effect, nor did it stimulate 
      anti-viral immunity. Data from this study warrants further investigation into the 
      mechanisms of TTV related immuno-pathogenesis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether genogroup 1 porcine torque teno virus (g1-TTV) can 
      potentiate clinical disease associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). SAMPLE 
      POPULATION: 33 gnotobiotic baby pigs. PROCEDURES: Pigs were allocated into 7 groups: 
      group A, 5 uninoculated control pigs from 3 litters; group B, 4 pigs oronasally 
      inoculated with PCV2 alone; group C, 4 pigs inoculated IP with first-passage g1-TTV 
      alone; group D, 4 pigs inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV alone; group E, 6 
      pigs inoculated IP with first-passage g1-TTV and then oronasally inoculated with 
      PCV2 7 days later; group F, 6 pigs inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV and then 
      inoculated oronasally with PCV2 7 days later; and group G, 4 pigs inoculated 
      oro-nasally with PCV2 and then inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV 7 days 
      later. RESULTS: 6 of 12 pigs inoculated with g1-TTV prior to PCV2 developed acute 
      onset of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). None of the pigs 
      inoculated with g1-TTV alone or PCV2 alone or that were challenge exposed to g1-TTV 
      after establishment of infection with PCV2 developed clinical illness. Uninoculated 
      control pigs remained healthy. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These data 
      implicated g1-TTV as another viral infection that facilitates PCV2-induced PMWS. 
      This raises the possibility that torque teno viruses in swine may contribute to 
      disease expression currently associated with only a single infectious agent.

AB  - The prevalence of DNA viruses in water from the Tamagawa River, Japan was 
      quantitatively surveyed for 6months, from April to September 2003. A total of 18 
      river water samples were subjected to virus concentration method using an 
      electronegative membrane, followed by DNA extraction and direct quantitative 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for DNA viruses. Adenoviruses of 
      serotypes 40 and 41 were detected most frequently in the river water samples tested 
      (61.1%), at a concentration ranging from 3.16x10(3) to 1.38x10(5) copies/l, followed 
      by JC polyomaviruses (11.1%) and torque teno viruses (5.6%). No sample was positive 
      for BK polyomaviruses. In addition, for selective detection of virus particles, 
      adenoviruses 40 and 41 were tested with qPCR combined with an immunomagnetic 
      separation technique; they were detected in only 16.7% of the samples, showing a 
      concentration ranging from 7.42x10(2) to 4.24x10(4) copies/l. This study is 
      significant since it is the first study to demonstrate the prevalence of 
      polyomaviruses in water samples in Japan and to use immunomagnetic separation qPCR 
      to detect adenovirus particles in aquatic environments.

TI  - New hepatitis viruses.
PG  - 214-6
AB  - Three new hepatitis viruses are reviewed; Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), Hepatitis G Virus 
      (HGV), and Transfusion Transmitted Virus (TTV). Only HEV has been clearly associated 
      with liver damage. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and tends to occur in 
      poor socio-economic conditions. Acute disease is diagnosed by the presence of 
      anti-HEV IgM antibodies in the serum. Hepatitis G virus and TTV are transmitted 
      parenterally. HGV is the same agent as GBV-C. Although it is hepatotropic, and high 
      levels of viremia may occur, pathogenicity to the liver has not been proven. TTV may 
      also be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. It is abundant in liver tissue but, 
      like HGV, pathogenicity has not been proven.

AB  - Torque Teno viruses (TTVs) are small DNA viruses which are ubiquitous in nature. 
      Recent reports indicate that swine torque teno viruses (TTSuVs) can act as primary 
      pathogens or play a role in exacerbating co-infections. However, very little is 
      known about the TTSuV host-viral interaction or how they so successfully establish 
      chronic infections in the host. To determine whether the major viral proteins can 
      modulate host immunity, recombinant TTSuV1 ORF1 and 2 proteins were expressed in a 
      swine macrophage cell line (3D4/31). The differential expression of a panel of 
      innate, adaptive, regulatory and inflammatory immune genes was studied by 
      quantitative PCR; using cDNA samples collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48h 
      post-transfection. The ORF1 protein induced an early anti-viral response. However, 
      at 6h post-transfection it also upregulated IL-10, PD-1 and SOCS-1, the suppressors 
      of T cell mediated immunity. An ensuing diminishment of the early protective 
      response was noted. The TTSuV1 ORF2 protein suppressed IFN-β and IL-13 responses but 
      did not significantly influence anti-viral immunity otherwise. These findings 
      indicate that the TTSuV1 ORF1 protein plays a significant but dual role in viral 
      immunity.

TI  - [The TT virus: review of the literature].
PG  - 355-65
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To review the literature on the TT virus. METHODS: The literature review 
      was based on articles identified through MEDLINE between Jan. 1, 1997, and August 
      15, 1999. RESULTS: In 1997, a new DNA virus, designated TTV, was isolated and seemed 
      to be associated with non A-G post-transfusion hepatitis. The virus was identified 
      using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because serology was not routinely 
      available. At least 16 genotypes were identified. Depending on the PCR technique 
      used, the prevalence of infection ranged from 17% to 71% in a group of sera tested. 
      The prevalence rate ranged from 1.2% to 62% among blood donors, from 0.5% to 83% 
      among hemophiliacs and from 1% to 71% in cases of chronic hepatitis. The current 
      hypothesis is that routes of infection were parenteral and orofecal. The 
      pathogenesis of this virus, if it really exists, is not yet clearly established. It 
      has been postulated that some interaction may exist between the TT virus and the 
      hepatitis C virus. The use of interferon seems to decrease the TT viremia, according 
      to results obtained outside the context of clinical trials. CONCLUSION: The 
      pathogenesis of the TT virus needs to be rapidly established for transmission 
      prevention and therapeutic intervention.

TI  - Enteric transmission of transfusion-transmitted virus.
PG  - 1201-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To detect the virus in the feces and sera of patients in an outbreak of 
      enterically transmitted non-A, non-E hepatitis, and this review covers the 
      epidemiologic features and experimental infection of this novel virus. DATA SOURCES: 
      Data sources come from our own work on this subject, published and unpublished. 
      STUDY SELECTION: Mainly our own work is included, and related literature is 
      collected. RESULTS: In an outbreak of enterically transmitted non-A-E hepatitis 
      among students, a total of 381 cases (60.7%) were documented. Viral fragments 
      identical to transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) were detected in both serum and 
      stool samples. Asymptomatic virus carriers among the staff had positive serum 
      (32.1%) and feces (24.6%), clearly a potential source of infection. This viral 
      infection prevalence in 2 remote villages in northern and southern China was 9.2% 
      and 10.6%, respectively, suggesting that China is an endemic area. In this study, 
      groups of 3 Rhesus monkeys were infected via oral or intravenous inoculation with 
      patient feces. Two additional monkeys were infected by passage. The virus was 
      detected in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), liver, spleen and small 
      intestine, while the virus positive single strand, which might be a replicative 
      intermediate, was only in liver, intestine and PBMC of all animals. CONCLUSIONS: 
      This nonenveloped DNA virus might be transmitted both by blood and enteric routes. 
      Considering its wide distribution and high prevalence, we suppose that nonparenteral 
      transmission is more important.

      quantitation and differential detection of species- or type-specific porcine Torque 
      teno viruses.
PG  - 140-6
LID - 10.1016/j.jviromet.2010.09.018 [doi]
AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV), a single-stranded circular DNA virus, has been 
      incriminated in swine diseases recently. Multiple infection with porcine TTV species 
      1 (PTTV1) and species 2 (PTTV2), each consisting of two types (PTTV1a and 1b) or 
      subtypes (PTTV2b and 2c), in a single pig had been reported by our group previously. 
      The present study described three novel assays for quantitation and differential 
      detection of porcine TTV. First, we developed two SYBR green-based real-time PCR 
      assays to quantify viral loads of two porcine TTV species, respectively. The PTTV1- 
      and PTTV2-specific real-time PCR primer sequences were selected to target conserved 
      regions identified by multiple alignments of ten available porcine TTV full-length 
      genomes. Furthermore, by coupling the two singleplex PCR assays, a duplex real-time 
      PCR assay followed by melting curve analysis was established for simultaneous 
      detection and differentiation of PTTV1 and PTTV2. In addition, a type-specific 
      duplex nested PCR was also developed to simultaneously detect and distinguish 
      between the two types, PTTV1a and 1b, in PTTV1 species. These assays provide rapid 
      and practical tools for molecular diagnosis of species- or type-specific porcine 
      TTV.

AB  - Although torque teno viruses are frequently detected in humans and animals the 
      pathogenicity and virulence of these viruses are currently unknown, and little 
      information on the dynamics of infection is available. In this study, 24 pigs were 
      monitored from 2 weeks of age to slaughter to determine the natural infection 
      dynamics of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species 1 (TTSuV1) and species 2 (TTSuV2). 
      Plasma and fecal material were collected at 2, 8 and 18 weeks of age and between 22 
      and 29 weeks of age, while organs and tissues were collected at slaughter. Both 
      viruses were found to disseminate very quickly within the herd. At 8 weeks, TTSuV2 
      and TTSuV1 were observed at rates of 88% and 58%, respectively, and peak excretion 
      occurred at 18 weeks. Furthermore, TTSuV DNA was detected in the plasma of between 
      96% and 100% of the animals, and viremia was maintained at a viral load between 5 × 
      10(4) and 5 × 10(6)copies/mL until slaughter. All tested organs and tissues 
      contained TTSuVs in amounts ranging from 10(3) to 10(8)copies/g; the highest 
      concentration of viruses was found in the liver. This study did not demonstrate any 
      association with disease, despite the high prevalence of TTSuVs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anellovirus species Torque teno virus (TTV), Torque teno mini virus 
      (TTMV), and Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) and flavivirus GBV-C are highly prevalent 
      and genetically diverse chronic human viral infections that have not yet been 
      associated with disease. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine if these commensal 
      viruses are transmitted by blood transfusions, we genetically analyzed viral species 
      in cryopreserved samples from blood donors and corresponding pre- and 
      posttransfusion samples from recipients enrolled in the Transfusion-Transmitted 
      Viruses Study cohort. RESULTS: All 24 individuals in 12 donor-recipient pairs were 
      infected with TTV, while 16 were infected with TTMV, 15 with TTMDV, and four with 
      GBV-C. None of the 12 informative cases of TTV transfusion or eight cases of TTMV 
      transfusion, where the donor and recipient viruses could be genetically 
      differentiated, resulted in detectable transmissions in which the donor viruses were 
      detected in the recipient by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction 
      products. Of the five informative cases of TTMDV transfusion, including two cases of 
      transfusion into TTMDV-negative recipients, one case of superinfection was seen with 
      both the recipient and the donor viral variants detected in the transfusion 
      recipient for at least 11 days posttransfusion. Three donor-recipient pairs were 
      informative for GBV-C transmission with only one transfusion into a GBV-C-negative 
      recipient resulting in a transiently detected infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission 
      of the common commensal anelloviruses and GBV-C during transfusion was detected in 2 
      of 12 already infected or uninfected recipients. Underestimation of the true rate of 
      viral transmission may be due to limitations in detecting donor viral variants 
      present as minority variants in the already infected transfusion recipients.

TI  - Probable transfusion-transmitted Zika virus in Brazil.
PG  - 1684-8
LID - 10.1111/trf.13681 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emerging arthropod-borne flavivirus transmitted 
      by Aedes mosquitoes. Recent commentaries regarding ZIKV routes of transmission 
      describe a potential transmission by transfusion. Herein, we report a probable case 
      of transfusion-transmitted ZIKV infection through a platelet transfusion that was 
      detected from postdonation information. CASE REPORT: A blood donor made a voluntary 
      telephone report to the blood donor facility 3 days after donation and informed the 
      facility of a febrile illness (fever, malaise, and headaches). Due to the ongoing 
      dengue epidemic, the initial clinical investigation included dengue among other 
      possible diagnoses. The serology and molecular laboratory results excluded dengue 
      infection. However, stored samples from the donation were positive for ZIKV on 
      reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis. A retrospective 
      investigation demonstrated that the platelet concentrate, which was part of a pool, 
      had been transfused after a liver transplantation. A physician had evaluated the 
      patient 4 days after surgery. Laboratory investigation showed enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay results that were negative for dengue immunoglobulin M 
      antibodies; however, the results were positive for hemagglutination inhibition 
      antibodies against flavivirus. ZIKV RT-PCR and virus isolation analyses in cell 
      cultures from recipient serum were both positive. The sequencing confirmed ZIKV in 
      the donor and patient samples. Ten partial nucleotide sequences from the ZIKV strain 
      that were detected in the donor were aligned and compared with the ZIKV genome 
      detected in the recipient, revealing a 99.8% homology between the two strains. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This is a case of probable transmission of ZIKV through blood 
      transfusion. The patient had been transfused with the blood product from an infected 
      donor, most likely in the incubation period after ZIKV infection but prior to 
      clinical disease onset. This report emphasizes the importance of postdonation 
      information and recipient investigations during outbreaks of potentially blood-borne 
      infections.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infection is common worldwide in both healthy and 
      diseased swine and a relationship between this virus and a particular disease in 
      pigs has not been established. This work aimed to investigate the presence of TTSuV1 
      and TTSuVk2a in Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-infected and non-infected domestic 
      pigs and free-living wild boars from Uruguay. Our data evidenced a high frequency of 
      detection and a wide circulation of TTSuV among pig herds and wild boar populations. 
      Furthermore, TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a co-infection was more frequent than single infections 
      in domestic pigs. In addition, we thoroughly characterized at the molecular level 
      TTSuV strains by extensive sequence data analysis. Our findings revealed an 
      extremely high genetic heterogeneity among Uruguayan isolates. On the basis of 
      detailed analyses, we proposed a more comprehensive criterion of TTSuV 
      classification which would contribute to shedding light over the genetic diversity 
      of these viruses worldwide. On the other hand, data obtained suggested that neither 
      TTSuV1 nor TTSuVk2a frequency of infection or viral loads have any correlation with 
      PCV2 infection, health status or age. The role of TTSuV during co-infection with 
      other pathogens and the age-related dynamics of TTSuV infection are currently under 
      debate. Therefore, taking into account the controversial epidemiological data 
      regarding these viruses and their ubiquitous infection, a likely role as components 
      of the host microbiota should be brought into discussion.

AB  - The cause of acute encephalitis/meningoencephalitis in pediatric patients remains 
      often unexplained despite extensive investigations for large panel of pathogens. To 
      explore a possible viral implication, we investigated the virome of cerebrospinal 
      fluid specimens of 70 febrile pediatric inpatients with clinical compatible 
      encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Using viral metagenomics, we detected and 
      genetically characterized three novel human Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) species 
      (TTMV-G1-3). Phylogenetically, TTMV-G1-3 clustered in three novel monophyletic 
      lineages within genus Betatorquevirus of the Anelloviridae family. TTMV-G1-3 were 
      highly prevalent in diseased children, but absent in the healthy cohort which may 
      indicate an association of TTMV species with febrile illness. With 2/3 detected 
      malaria co-infection, it remains unclear if these novel anellovirus species are 
      causative agents or increase disease severity by interaction with malaria parasites. 
      The presence of the viruses 28 days after initiating antimalarial and/or antibiotic 
      treatment suggests a still active viral infection likely as effect of parasitic 
      and/or bacterial co-infection that may have initiated a modulated immune system 
      environment for viral replication or a defective virus clearance. This study 
      increases the current knowledge on the genetic diversity of TTMV and strengthens 
      that human anelloviruses can be considered as biomarkers for strong perturbations of 
      the immune system in certain pathological conditions.

AB  - In the present study, Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) was detected from different 
      tissues, stool and serum samples of 25 sick pigs. The total prevalence of TTSuV1 and 
      TTSuV2 were 64% (16/25) and 28% (7/25), 24% (6/25) were co-infected with both TTSuV1 
      and TTSuV2. The prevalence of TTSuV infection in spleen is a slightly higher, with 
      positive rates of 52% (13/25) for TTSuV1 and 24% (6/25) for TTSuV2. Phylogenetic 
      analysis of TTSuV1 showed that 21 isolates were distributed into two clusters 
      (genotype TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), with genotype TTSuV1b was the dominant genotype. 
      Phylogenetic analysis of TTSuV2 showed that the nine isolates shared 80.9-99.2% 
      nucleotide homology with each other, and were distributed in different genotypes 
      (TTSuV2a-TTSuV2f). TTSuV2d was the most prevalent genotype in this study, which 
      contained five Spanish strains and nine Chinese strains, and shared 94.2-96.8% 
      homology.

TI  - Possible pathogenic nature of the recently discovered TT virus: does it play a role 
      in autoimmune rheumatic diseases?
PG  - 5-9
AB  - Pathogenesis of viral origin has long been suggested in autoimmune rheumatic 
      diseases. Beside the well-defined virus induced transient or chronic rheumatic 
      diseases often resembling systemic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid 
      arthritis, viruses can contribute to disease pathogenesis by several different 
      pathomechanisms. TT virus is a recently discovered virus of extremely high genetic 
      diversity which commonly infects humans. Despite accumulated evidence on the 
      biological characteristics of TTV, its pathogenicity is still in question; many 
      consider TTV as a harmless endosymbiont. The recent paper overviews the biology of 
      TT virus and investigates the hypothesis that TTV might have a causative role in 
      human diseases with special attention to the possibility that TTV might trigger 
      autoimmunity in rheumatic disorders.

TI  - In vivo and in vitro intragenomic rearrangement of TT viruses.
PG  - 9346-56
AB  - The in vitro replication of the Torque teno virus (TT virus) tth8 full-length genome 
      and particle formation in a Hodgkin's lymphoma-derived cell line after transfection 
      with cloned viral DNA were demonstrated. Analyses of the transcription patterns of 
      tth8 and tth7 TT virus isolates in a number of lymphoma and T-cell leukemia cell 
      lines indicated differential additional splicing events and intragenomic 
      rearrangement generating open reading frames which could not be deducted from the 
      genomic sequence. We also demonstrated the presence of rearranged TT virus genomes 
      in vivo in sera taken from pregnant mothers whose children later developed childhood 
      leukemia, as well as sera from control mothers. Control experiments using religated 
      cloned genomic tth8 DNA mixed with cellular DNA did not result in such subviral 
      molecules. These subviral isolates ranged from 172 bp to full-length TT virus 
      genomes. Possible in vivo selection for specific rearranged molecules was indicated 
      by the presence of one isolate (561 bp) in 11 serum samples. It remains to be 
      clarified whether selected rearranged subviral components resulting from specific TT 
      virus types may contribute to the initiation of disease. These data demonstrate new 
      features of TT viruses suggesting possible similarities to plant viruses of the 
      family Geminiviridae, as well as raise questions about the documented plurality and 
      diversity of anelloviruses.

TI  - Are hepatitis G virus and TT virus involved in cryptogenic chronic liver disease?
PG  - 53-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hepatitis G virus can cause chronic infection in man but the role of 
      this agent in chronic liver disease is poorly understood. Little is known about the 
      relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver 
      disease. AIM: To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT 
      virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease. PATIENTS: A total of 23 
      subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom all 
      known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with hepatitis C 
      virus-related chronic liver disease. METHODS: Evaluation of anti-hepatitis G virus 
      by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase chain reaction with 
      primers from the 5' NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by nested polymerase chain 
      reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. Hepatitis G virus-RNA was 
      detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 
      40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker 
      of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, 
      mostly mutually exclusive) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic 
      hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26. 1% vs 40% 
      p=ns). T virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with 
      hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, 
      including stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G 
      virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage [chronic hepatitis with 
      fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with hepatitis C 
      virus liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is 
      widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk 
      factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that 
      observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic 
      role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with 
      cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of 
      parenteral exposure.

AB  - Although several studies suggest a virus or (endogenous) retrovirus involvement at 
      the time of onset of schizophrenia, the unequivocal identification of one or more 
      infectious agents, by means of an undirected catch-all technique, has never been 
      conducted. In this study VIDISCA, a virus discovery method, was used in combination 
      with Roche-454 high-throughput sequencing as a tool to determine the possible 
      presence of viruses (known or unknown) in blood of first-onset drugs-naïve 
      schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms. Two viruses (the 
      Anellovirus Torque Teno virus and GB virus C) were detected. Both viruses are 
      commonly found in healthy individuals and no clear link with disease was ever 
      established. Viruses from the family Anelloviridae were also identified in the 
      control population (4.8%). Besides, one patient sample was positive for human 
      endogenous retroviruses type K (HML-2) RNA but no specific predominant strain was 
      detected, instead 119 different variants were found. In conclusion, these findings 
      indicate no evidence for viral or endogenous retroviral involvement in sera at the 
      time of onset of schizophrenia.

AB  - Recent studies have established that the human urine contains a complex microbiome, 
      including a virome about which little is known. Following immunosuppression in 
      kidney transplant patients, BK polyomavirus (BKV) has been shown to induce 
      nephropathy (BKVN), decreasing graft survival. In this study we investigated the 
      urine virome profile of BKV+ and BKV- kidney transplant recipients. Virus-like 
      particles were stained to confirm the presence of VLP in the urine samples. 
      Metagenomic DNA was purified, and the virome profile was analyzed using metagenomic 
      shotgun sequencing. While the BK virus was predominant in the BKV+ group, it was 
      also found in the BKV- group patients. Additional viruses were also detected in all 
      patients, notably including JC virus (JCV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) and 
      interestingly, we detected multiple subtypes of the BKV, JCV and TTV. Analysis of 
      the BKV subtypes showed that nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the VP1, VP2 
      and Large T Antigen proteins, suggesting potential functional effects for enhanced 
      pathogenicity. Our results demonstrate a complex urinary virome in kidney transplant 
      patients with multiple viruses with several distinct subtypes warranting further 
      analysis of virus subtypes in immunosuppressed hosts.

TI  - Molecular properties, biology, and clinical implications of TT virus, a recently 
      identified widespread infectious agent of humans.
PG  - 98-113
AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first described in 1997 by representational difference analysis 
      of sera from non-A to non-G posttransfusion hepatitis patients and hence intensively 
      investigated as a possible addition to the list of hepatitis-inducing viruses. The 
      TTV genome is a covalently closed single-stranded DNA of approximately 3.8 kb with a 
      number of characteristics typical of animal circoviruses, especially the chicken 
      anemia virus. TTV is genetically highly heterogeneous, which has led investigators 
      to group isolates into numerous genotypes and subtypes and has limited the 
      sensitivity of many PCR assays used for virus detection. The most remarkable feature 
      of TTV is the extraordinarily high prevalence of chronic viremia in apparently 
      healthy people, up to nearly 100% in some countries. The original hypothesis that it 
      might be an important cause of cryptogenic hepatitis has not been borne out, 
      although the possibility that it may produce liver damage under specific 
      circumstances has not been excluded. The virus has not yet been etiologically linked 
      to any other human disease. Thus, TTV should be considered an orphan virus.

TI  - Recently discovered blood-borne viruses.
PG  - 98-122
AB  - In recent years, molecular biology advances have enabled many investigators to 
      discover a number of viruses that have been difficult to characterise by cell 
      culture techniques. Two blood-borne viruses have been identified. These are GB virus 
      C (GBV-C) and TT virus (TTV). GBV-C was discovered in 1995. It is a flavivirus-like 
      enveloped particle measuring 50-100 nm in diameter with a density of 1.08-1.13 
      g/cm3. The genome of GBV-C is a single-stranded, positive strand ribonucleic acid of 
      approximately 8600 nucleotides. The TTV was discovered in 1997. It is a circular 
      single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid virus, non-enveloped of approximately 3900 
      nucleotides. It has a density of 1.31-1.34 g/cm3 and a particle size of 30-50 nm. 
      Both viruses are distributed widely throughout the world. Most GBV-C infections are 
      asymptomatic, transient and self-limiting. To date, solid evidence for any 
      association of TTV with disease has not been demonstrated.

AB  - The study describes a novel rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay to detect 
      members of the family Anelloviridae from swine and human serum samples. The RCA was 
      carried out using short anellovirus (AV)-specific primers based on a highly 
      conserved region among available AV full-length genomes. Then, RCA products were 
      used as templates to amplify full-length genomes with an AV-specific PCR. 
      Amplification products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and full-length 
      genomes were isolated based on the known size. With this novel AV-RCA/PCR approach 
      it was possible to detect Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 
      2 (TTSuV2) in swine and many species of Torque teno virus (TTV) in human sera, which 
      were previously tested negative by conventional PCRs.

AB  - Two species of the DNA virus Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, have 
      become widely distributed in pig-farming countries in recent years. In this study, 
      we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available 
      TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and 
      TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. 
      Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of 
      codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently 
      occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis 
      (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different 
      quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional 
      constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In 
      addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative 
      synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between 
      geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison 
      of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the 
      codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1. However the similarity 
      was low for each virus and its host. These conclusions provide important insight 
      into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV2, as well as better understangding 
      of the molecular evolution of TTSuV2 genomes.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology and genotyping of TT virus isolated from Saudi blood donors 
      and hepatitis patients.
PG  - 444-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: In Saudi Arabia, the epidemiology and clinical significance of Torque 
      Teno virus (TTV) infection alone and in patients with hepatitis virus infections 
      have not been determined in a single study. In this paper, we molecularly 
      investigated the rate and genotypes of TTV infection among Saudi Arabian blood 
      donors and patients with viral hepatitis. The effect of TTV coinfection on viral 
      hepatitis was also examined. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the sera 
      of 200 healthy blood volunteers, 45 hepatitis B virus patients, 100 hepatitis C 
      virus patients, 19 hepatitis G virus patients, and 56 non-A-G hepatitis patients. 
      TTV DNA was amplified using primers derived from the ORF1 and 5'UTR regions. The 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was determined for each specimen. Sequencing of 
      ORF1 amplicons was carried out to investigate TTV genotypes. RESULTS: Using primers 
      derived from ORF1 and 5'UTR, TTV DNA was detected in 5.5% and 50.5%, respectively, 
      of healthy blood donors, in 2.2% and 88.8% in hepatitis B patients, in 2.0% and 70% 
      of hepatitis C patients, in 15.8% and 100% of hepatitis G patients, in 5.4% and 
      12.5% of non-A-G hepatitis patients and in 4.8% and 56.4% overall. No detrimental 
      effect of TTV coinfection in viral hepatitis patients was noted. An overall 
      prevalence of 4.8% and 56.4% was established. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that 
      the most common genotype of TTV among Saudis is 2c. CONCLUSION: The rate of TTV 
      infection among Saudi Arabians seems to be lower than that stated in previous 
      reports on Saudi Arabia and in some other countries. The virus does not seem to 
      worsen the status of those who are suffering from viral hepatitis infection.

TI  - First time molecular detection and phylogenetic relationships of torque teno sus 
      virus 1 and 2 in domestic pigs in Uganda: further evidence for a global 
      distribution.
PG  - 39
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-9-39 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) are small, 
      single-stranded circular DNA viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae family. 
      Available studies clearly show that both viruses are widely distributed in the pig 
      populations in America, Europe and Asia, although the impact of the infection is 
      still unclear. Currently, the situation in domestic pig populations on the African 
      continent is not known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the 
      possible presence of the two viruses in domestic pigs in Uganda, and describe the 
      phylogenetic relationships to those in the rest of the world. RESULTS: Ninety-five 
      serum samples from six districts in Uganda were used, and PCR using TTSuV1 and 2 
      specific primers for the UTR region was run for viral nucleic acid detection. The 
      positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses performed in order to 
      compare the Ugandan sequences with sequences from other parts of the world. The 
      prevalence of TTSuV1 and 2 in the selected domestic pigs were estimated at 16.8% and 
      48.4% respectively, with co-infection found in 13.7%. The sequence identity was 
      90-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV1; and 63-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV2 
      sequences. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV1 and 2 in 
      domestic pigs in Uganda. These results highlight the importance of screening for 
      emerging viruses given the globalisation of human activities.

TI  - Kinetics of Alphatorquevirus plasma DNAemia at late times after allogeneic

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) plasma DNA load has been consistently shown to be a 
      surrogate biomarker of immunosuppression in solid organ transplant recipients. It is 
      uncertain whether it may behave similarly in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplant recipients (allo-HSCT). Here, we characterized the dynamics of TTV 
      DNAemia in patients undergoing T-cell replete allo-SCT at late times after 
      transplantation (> day + 100). This retrospective single-center observational study 
      included 33 allo-HSCT patients. Plasma TTV DNA loads were quantified by real-time 
      PCR before initiating the conditioning regimen and at different time points after 
      transplant. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were measured by flow cytometry. 
      Overall, TTV DNA load increased steadily after engraftment, reaching a peak by 
      day + 90; afterwards, it remained relatively constant until day + 210. TTV DNA loads 
      measured within days + 120 and + 210 correlated inversely with paired ALC, while 
      both parameters did correlate directly within days + 20 and + 60. The median TTV DNA 
      area under a curve between days + 90 and + 210 [(AUC)(90-210)] was significantly 
      higher in patients who received corticosteroids within this time frame for treatment 
      of graft versus host disease (either acute, chronic or both) than in controls 
      (P = 0.025). In summary, TTV DNA load may mirror the degree of immunosuppression at 
      late times after allo-HSCT.

TI  - [Does the TT virus affect T-cell subgroups in patients undergoing hemodialysis?].
PG  - 831-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently many publications have appeared about the new DNA virus, called 
      transfusion transmitted virus (TT virus), first described in 1997. These are mainly 
      about the virus epidemiology, gene sequences and the distribution of different 
      genotypes. In spite of the fact that the prevalence of this type of infection can 
      reach 40 percent rate in polytransfused patients, such as in hemodialysis patients, 
      the real pathogenetic effect of the virus has not yet been known. AIMS: The aim of 
      the authors was to examine the activation and distribution of mononuclear cells in 
      peripheral blood and to analyse the possible changes in Th1/Th2 immune regulatory 
      mechanism through the soluble and intracellular cytokine profile beside the 
      biochemical parameters of hepatic lesions in TT virus positive (n = 32) and negative 
      (n = 17) hemodialysed patients. Healthy blood donors were the control group (n = 
      20). METHOD: Semi-nested PCR was used to detect the DNA of TT virus. For the surface 
      antigen (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, CD3/HLA-DR, CD3/CD69) and intracellular cytokine 
      analysis the authors applied flow cytometric method. RESULTS: The authors did not 
      find any differences in the liver specific biochemical parameters between TT virus 
      positive and negative hemodialysed and the healthy control group. The number of 
      total T, T helper and total B cells were decreased. The percentage of CD8+, 
      CD3+/HLA-DR+, CD3+/CD69+ and CD56+ cells were increased significantly in both 
      hemodialysed population independently the presence or absence of TT virus. The 
      soluble and intracellular cytokines showed significant growth of the Th1/Th2 cells 
      ratio in hemodialysed patients, which has not been modified by the virus. 
      CONCLUSIONS: From these results the authors assume that the TT virus does not cause 
      any significant changes in the immune regulation, although it could play some role 
      in the pathogenesis of hepatitis by local reaction.

TI  - [TT virus--characteristics, occurrence and routes of transmission].
PG  - 91-9
AB  - Recent discovery of a novel DNA virus from the serum of a Japanese patient (T.T.) 
      has prompted further studies directed on possible role of TT virus in the 
      development of cryptogenic hepatitis. The TT is an unenveloped and circular DNA 
      virus. TTV possesses single stranded DNA genome and comprises 3537 to 3853 
      nucleotides. TTV is similar to the Circoviridae and possesses three open reading 
      frames. Phylogenetic analysis revealed up to 30% nucleotide sequence divergence in 
      the 16 virus genotypes. TTV infection can be detected by polymerase chain reactions, 
      in situ hybridization and by specific antibodies to TTV. TTV DNA has been identified 
      in the serum of patients with cryptogenic hepatitis, hepatitis B and C, 
      hepatocellular carcinoma as well as in healthy individuals. TTV has been found also 
      in the peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow cells, liver biopsies as well as in 
      feces and breast milk. Some animals including cattle, sheep, pigs and chicken 
      appeared to have TTV viremia. Recent detection of TTV in nonblood products, such as 
      saliva and feces suggest in addition to parenteral also nonparenteral routes of TTV 
      transmissions including sexual and fecal-oral.

TI  - Application of cation-coated filter method to detection of noroviruses, 
      enteroviruses, adenoviruses, and torque teno viruses in the Tamagawa River in Japan.
PG  - 2403-11
AB  - The occurrence of human enteric viruses in surface water in the Tamagawa River, 
      Japan, was surveyed for 1 year, from April 2003 to March 2004. Sixty-four samples 
      were collected from six sites along the river, and 500 ml of the sample was 
      concentrated using the cation-coated filter method, which was developed in our 
      previous study. This method showed recovery yields of 56% +/- 32% (n = 37) for 
      surface water samples inoculated with polioviruses. More than one kind of tested 
      virus was detected in 43 (67%) of 64 samples by TaqMan PCR. Noroviruses and 
      adenoviruses were detected in a high positive ratio; 34 (53%), 28 (44%), and 29 
      (45%) of 64 samples were positive for norovirus genotype 1 and genotype 2 and 
      adenoviruses, respectively. The mean concentrations of norovirus genotype 1 or 
      genotype 2 determined by real-time PCR were 0.087 and 0.61 genome/ml, respectively, 
      showing much higher values in winter (0.21 genome/ml for genotype 1 and 2.3 
      genomes/ml for genotype 2). Enteroviruses were detected by both direct PCR (6 of 64 
      samples; 9%) and cell culture PCR (2 of 64 samples; 3%). Torque teno viruses, 
      emerging hepatitis viruses, were also isolated in three samples (5%). The 
      concentration of total coliforms and the presence of F-specific phages showed a high 
      correlation with the presence of viruses, which suggested that the simultaneous use 
      of total coliforms and F-specific phages as indicators of surface water may work to 
      monitor viral contamination.

      analysis of near-full-length genome sequences.
PG  - 571-582
LID - 10.1007/s00705-020-04538-1 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV), torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and torque teno midi virus 
      (TTMDV) are members of the family Anelloviridae that are known to infect humans. 
      Although no pathogenic roles have been associated with anelloviruses, their high 
      prevalence and perceived ubiquitousness have provoked scientific interest in 
      understanding their molecular and biological characteristics. We used nested PCR to 
      determine the prevalence of anelloviruses among 130 human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV)-infected patients and 130 healthy blood donors, and analyzed three 
      near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates from HIV-infected and non-HIV 
      infected Nigerians. Statistical analysis showed that the rate of TTV infection was 
      significantly higher in the HIV-infected group (65%) than in the blood donor group 
      (26%) (p < 0.05, χ(2) = 40.3). TTMV and TTMDV infections were very high in both 
      groups, ranging between 88 and 95%. No significant association was found between TTV 
      infection and age, sex, CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load or alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT) level. Near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates 
      FL100, FL08 and BD67 determined by next-generation sequencing were 3.6 kb, 3.2 kb 
      and 2.9 kb, respectively, in size. Their GenBank accession numbers are MK820644, 
      MK820645, MK820646, respectively. These isolates shared 59% sequence identity across 
      the whole genome and clustered in two different phylogenetic groups. Our study 
      established for the first time the circulation of TTV, TTMV and TTMDV in the 
      Nigerian population, with a disproportionately higher prevalence of TTV in 
      HIV-infected patients. The near-complete TTV genome sequences from Nigeria are 
      similar to the sequences KT163879 and KT163916 (3748 and 3190 respectively), 
      obtained from the plasma of HIV-infected subjects from the United States, and 
      EU305675 (2919), identified in human plasma samples from France.

TI  - The prevalence of SEN virus infection in blood donors in Iran.
PG  - 423-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: SEN virus is a blood-borne, single-stranded, nonenveloped DNA virus. Two 
      of its strains (D and H), appear to be associated with non-A-to-E hepatitis more 
      frequently than the others, although it is not clear whether this observation has 
      any significance. The prevalence of SEN virus in otherwise healthy individuals, 
      including blood donors, differs markedly by geographic region. In this study, an 
      investigation to evaluate the prevalence of SEN virus strains among blood donors in 
      Tehran was carried out. METHODS: Sera of 260 blood donors who were negative for 
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and third-generation hepatitis C virus antibody 
      (anti-HCV) were tested for SEN virus-D and -H DNA. DNA was extracted from plasma of 
      260 blood donors and amplified by semi- nested polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: 
      SEN virus-D viremia was detected in four (1.5%) of the 260 blood donors (95% 
      confidence interval (CI), 0.0 - 3%). SEN virus-H viremia was detected in 47 (18.08%) 
      of the 260 blood donors (95% CI, 13.4 - 22.8%). Both SEN virus-D and SEN virus-H 
      viremia were detected in nine (3.4%) of the 260 blood donors (95% CI, 1.2 - 5.7%). 
      SEN virus-D or SEN virus-H viremia was identified in 60 (23.08%) of the 260 blood 
      donors (95% CI, 18.08 - 28.08%). CONCLUSION: Out of the 260 blood donors, 60 (23%) 
      were infected by SEN virus-D/H. The prevalence of SEN virus-H is more than SEN 
      virus-D. Our results also showed that the high prevalence of SEN virus in healthy 
      blood donors with no history of blood transfusion may attribute to the transmission 
      modes other than parenteral transmission.

TI  - Full or near full length nucleotide sequences of TT virus variants (Types SANBAN and 
      YONBAN) and the TT virus-like mini virus.
PG  - 119-23
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a common virus and consists of many genotypes and variants. In 
      addition, there exists a virus which both differs greatly from and retains a 
      considerable resemblance to TTV, such as the TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) as we 
      reported previously. Here we report the near full length genomic sequences of 4 
      isolates of a new variant of TTV (designated YONBAN) along with the full length 
      sequences of 2 isolates of the TTV-SANBAN lineage and 7 isolates of the TLMV species 
      derived from human sera. The TTV-YONBAN sequences showed only about 50% identity at 
      the nucleotide level to those of the prototype TTV (TA278) and to SANBAN, and even 
      less to TLMV. Moreover, the ORF1 of YONBAN lacked the ATG initiation codon which is 
      shared by all the TTV and TLMV isolates so far identified in humans; instead, YONBAN 
      had a Kozak's rule-compatible ACG codon as the candidate initiation site for the 
      ORF1 translation. Nevertheless, the overall genetic structure and the conserved 
      amino acid motifs within the ORF1 and the ORF2 were well shared among the prototype 
      TTV strains, the SANBAN and YONBAN variants, and TLMV. The most conserved nucleotide 
      sequence was found in the noncoding region just upstream from the ORF2, allowing 
      construction of a phylogenetic tree which implied that the TTV genotypes and 
      variants, the TLMV, and chicken anemia virus could be coclassified under a 
      superfamily for which we proposed the name of 'Paracircoviridae' in our previous 
      report.

TI  - TT virus infection in gibbons.
PG  - 663-6
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is not only an infectious agent of worldwide distribution but has 
      also been demonstrated in various non-human primates in addition to humans. In the 
      present study, we subjected the sera of 67 gibbons to PCR and nucleotide sequencing, 
      with subsequent phylogenetic analysis to determine the nature of the relationship 
      between TTV found in humans and non-human primates. We discovered the virus in 9/67 
      (13.4%) of the gibbon sera and subjected 6 of those to direct sequencing. The 
      phylogenetic tree constructed encompassed all TTV species known to date, revealing a 
      close proximity between the gibbon virus and those detected in Thai individuals, 
      whereas the chimpanzee strains were phylogenetically more remote.

TI  - TT virus detection in oral lichen planus lesions.
PG  - 183-9
AB  - Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a correlation between oral lichen planus 
      and different liver diseases. The new virus termed TT virus (TTV) is highly 
      prevalent in patients with chronic hepatitis of different etiology and it may be 
      speculated that TT virus may be involved in the pathogenesis of oral lichen planus. 
      This study examined the presence of TT virus DNA in serum by PCR and in oral mucosa 
      biopsies by in situ hybridization from 20 patients with oral lichen planus (13 with 
      chronic hepatitis and seven without liver disease). Serum and oral mucosa biopsies 
      from six patients all with chronic hepatitis with leukoplakia were also studied as 
      controls. TT virus DNA was positive in the serum of 17/20 (85%) of the patients with 
      oral lichen planus and in all the controls. TT virus DNA hybridization signals were 
      detected in mucosa biopsies from all the patients with TT virus DNA in serum but in 
      none of the three cases without this marker. The percentage of positive cells ranged 
      from 1.6-80%. No differences were found in the percentage of positive cells between 
      TT virus positive patients with and without oral lichen planus and there was no 
      relationship between the number of positive cells and the intensity of the 
      inflammatory infiltrate. In conclusion, TT virus infects oral epithelial cells but 
      the results do not support a role for TT virus in causing oral lichen planus.

AB  - Infections during pregnancy have been suggested to be involved in childhood 
      leukemias. We used high-throughput sequencing to describe the viruses most readily 
      detectable in serum samples of pregnant women. Serum DNA of 112 mothers to leukemic 
      children was amplified using whole genome amplification. Sequencing identified one 
      TT virus (TTV) isolate belonging to a known type and two putatively new TTVs. For 22 
      mothers, we also performed TTV amplification by general primer PCR before 
      sequencing. This detected 39 TTVs, two of which were identical to the TTVs found 
      after whole genome amplification. Altogether, we found 40 TTV isolates, 29 of which 
      were putatively new types (similarities ranging from 89% to 69%). In conclusion, 
      high throughput sequencing is useful to describe the known or unknown viruses that 
      are present in serum samples of pregnant women.

TI  - Prevalence and genomic variability of transfusion transmitted virus in Italian 
      cryptogenic chronic liver disease and healthy blood donors.
PG  - 570-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with transfusion transmitted virus, a new member of the 
      Parvoviridae family, has been found in patients both with chronic and fulminant 
      post-transfusion cryptogenic hepatitis. AIM: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical 
      impact of transfusion transmitted virus infection in Italy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 
      Studies were carried out on 256 patients and control subjects from three centres 
      from Northern, Central and Southern Italy (92 nonA-nonC chronic hepatitis, 10 acute 
      non fulminant cryptogenic hepatitis, 41 hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis 
      and 113 blood donors). Serum transfusion transmitted virus was detected by nested 
      polymerase chain reaction using two overlapping sets of primers. RESULTS: A total of 
      52 of the 92 patients (54.3%) with chronic cryptogenic liver disease and 17 of the 
      41 hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis patients (41.4%) were transfusion transmitted 
      virus-DNA positive. Transfusion transmitted virus co-infection in hepatitis C virus 
      patients was not associated with either a higher severity of liver histology or 
      higher alanine transaminase levels or signs of cholestasis, transfusion transmitted 
      virus was found in 48 out of 113 (42.4%) blood donors. In the majority of samples, 
      transfusion transmitted virus DNA was detected with only one of the two sets of 
      primers used. Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis performed on 21 randomly selected 
      viral isolates showed the presence of both type 1 and type 2 transfusion transmitted 
      virus and allowed identification of two isolates with high homology to genotype 6, 
      described, so far, mostly in Japan. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion transmitted virus type 
      1 and 2 infection is common among blood donors and patients with liver disease in 
      Italy. The pathogenic potential of transfusion transmitted virus type 1 and 2 in 
      nonA-nonC hepatitis patients is unlikely but further studies are needed to evaluate 
      the epidemiological and clinical impact of other transfusion transmitted virus 
      subtypes.

TI  - Blood levels of TT virus following immune stimulation with influenza or hepatitis B 
      vaccine.
PG  - 358-65
AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) has been demonstrated to be present persistently in the 
      blood of healthy individuals without evidence that it causes any disease process. 
      The levels of TTV vary in patients co-infected with other viruses and there has been 
      considerable speculation as to whether TTV contributes to pathogenesis by other 
      viruses or if the varying levels might be related to immune activation in the host. 
      In the present study, the load of TTV was examined in plasma and peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following immunization of subjects with either influenza 
      (a recall antigen) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (a new antigenic exposure). The 
      results overall did not indicate a significant change in TTV titers over a 90 day 
      observation period; however, when TTV genogroup was taken into consideration there 
      was an increase in viral load in plasma at some time points for subjects 
      persistently infected with genogroup 3. While this was observed in both influenza 
      and HBV immunized subjects, the effect was more profound in HBV vaccination. Thus, 
      it appears that exposure to a new antigen rather than a recall antigen may stimulate 
      TTV replication more effectively. The data further suggest that investigating the 
      interactions between TTV and its host might require to examine specifically each TTV 
      genogroup separately in order to determine if certain TTV types have any role in 
      disease pathogenesis.

TI  - Metagenomic sequencing complements routine diagnostics in identifying viral 
      pathogens in lung transplant recipients with unknown etiology of respiratory 
      infection.
PG  - e0177340
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0177340 [doi]
LID - e0177340
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lung transplant patients are a vulnerable group of immunosuppressed 
      patients that are prone to frequent respiratory infections. We studied 60 episodes 
      of respiratory symptoms in 71 lung transplant patients. Almost half of these 
      episodes were of unknown infectious etiology despite extensive routine diagnostic 
      testing. METHODS: We re-analyzed respiratory samples of all episodes with 
      undetermined etiology in order to detect potential viral pathogens missed/not 
      accounted for in routine diagnostics. Respiratory samples were enriched for viruses 
      by filtration and nuclease digestion, whole nucleic acids extracted and randomly 
      amplified before high throughput metagenomic virus sequencing. Viruses were 
      identified by a bioinformatic pipeline and confirmed and quantified using specific 
      real-time PCR. RESULTS: In completion of routine diagnostics, we identified and 
      confirmed a viral etiology of infection by our metagenomic approach in four patients 
      (three Rhinovirus A, one Rhinovirus B infection) despite initial negative results in 
      specific multiplex PCR. Notably, the majority of samples were also positive for 
      Torque teno virus (TTV) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). While TTV viral loads 
      increased with immunosuppression in both throat swabs and blood samples, HHV-7 
      remained at low levels throughout the observation period and was restricted to the 
      respiratory tract. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the potential of metagenomic 
      sequencing for virus diagnostics in cases with previously unknown etiology of 
      infection and in complex diagnostic situations such as in immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Changes in viraemia of two chronically replicating circoviruses, TT virus (TTV) and 
      TTV-like mini virus (TLMV), were investigated in patients developing HIV-related 
      immune deficiency. In a few cases, episodes of a considerable increase in viraemia 
      were observed, but in most patients there were no discernible increases as immune 
      deficiency progressed. The deterioration of immune function associated with AIDS did 
      not by itself have any obvious effect on TTV and TLMV.

TI  - Replication of TT virus in hepatocyte and leucocyte cell lines.
PG  - 136-43
AB  - The TT virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, circular, DNA virus, first 
      isolated from a patient with hepatitis of unexplained etiology. The much deliberated 
      pathological role of the virus continues to be conjectural in the absence of a 
      suitable in vitro replication model. So far, the liver and the bone marrow have been 
      shown to be the main sites of TTV replication. In this study, the human cell lines 
      HepG2 and Chang Liver, the rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1, phytohemagglutinin 
      (PHA)-stimulated TTV-negative peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures and 
      the B lymphoblast cell line, Raji were investigated as potential in vitro 
      replication systems for TTV. The cell lines were infected with an inoculum prepared 
      by pooling TTV genotype1 DNA positive sera and monitored for virus replication. Of 
      the three hepatocyte cell lines, while the HepG2 and MH1C1 cell lines did not 
      support TTV replication, the Chang Liver cell line showed clear morphological 
      changes as a result of the in vitro infection, which included clumping and granular 
      degeneration of the entire cell sheet over a period of 6 days. The infected cells 
      also showed presence of virus-specific mRNA representative of viral transcription. 
      The consistent presence of infectious viral particles in the supernatant culture 
      fluid at 24-hr fluid replacement intervals indicated limited extra-cellular release 
      of viral particles. The PHA-stimulated TTV-negative PBMC cultures and the Raji cell 
      line were also able to support TTV replication and released significant levels of 
      infectious viral particles into the supernantant culture fluid.

PG  - 46-53
AB  - After the discovery of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses, several lines of evidence 
      suggested that an additional hepatitis agent (s) might exist. Molecular approaches 
      led sequentially to the discoveries of GBV-C/HGV, TTV and more recently SENV. At 
      issue is whether these agents cause non - A non - E hepatitis and/or some 
      extrahepatic diseases. These problems are discussed in present paper, considering 
      the newest data from literature.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology and clinical implications of TT virus (TTV) infection in 
      Indian subjects.
PG  - 422-9
AB  - GOALS: This study was aimed at obtaining data on the epidemiology and clinical 
      course of TT virus (TTV) infections among Indian subjects. BACKGROUND: The TTV is a 
      nonenveloped DNA virus, first identified in the peripheral blood of individuals with 
      posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. There has been much conjecture 
      regarding the disease association of this virus. STUDY: A total of 494 serum 
      specimens from various groups of high-risk and control subjects were screened for 
      TTV DNA by a semi-nested PCR, using the ORF1-derived N22 primers. The sera were also 
      screened for the HBsAg surface antigen by an ELISA, HCV RNA by a 5' NCR-based RT-PCR 
      and GBV-C/HGV RNA by a 5' UTR-based RT-PCR. The clinical and hepatic profiles of the 
      various subjects were also studied. Seventy-one randomly picked TTV isolates were 
      directly sequenced and their phylogeny was studied. RESULTS: TTV showed an overall 
      positivity rate of 45.34% with a significant higher prevalence of 52.9% among the 
      high-risk subjects as against a prevalence of 28% among healthy control subjects (P 
      < 0.001). Abnormal liver function profiles were frequent among TTV viremic 
      individuals and among the acute hepatitis cases studied a higher mortality rate 
      correlated with a superimposed TTV infection. The 71 TTV isolates sequenced were 
      found to belong to genotype 1a being closely homologous to TTV prototype TA278. 
      CONCLUSION: The TT virus shows a significant prevalence in the Indian population, 
      particularly among subjects at risk for acquiring parenterally transmitted 
      infections. Our study corroborates a putative role of the virus in the etiology of 
      liver disease, particularly in coinfection with other agents.

PG  - 2441-5
LID - 10.1007/s00705-012-1443-3 [doi]
AB  - HCV infection is known to be associated with clinical complications in thalassemic 
      patients. D and H genotypes of SEN virus (SENV) are associated with blood-product 
      transfusion and possibly non-A-to-E hepatitis. In this study, SENV viremia and its 
      effect on liver ALT level in thalassemic patients, thalassemic patients infected 
      with HCV, and HCV-infected patients were examined. Semi-nested PCR was conducted for 
      detection of genotype H and D DNA, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
      was measured. There was no significant difference in the mean ALT level in the 
      studied groups and between SENV-positive and SENV-negative individuals. The results 
      also showed that SENV infection does not affect the ALT level in these patients.

PG  - 478-80
LID - 10.4103/0377-4929.107784 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SEN virus (SEN-V) and TT virus (TTV) have been classified in the 
      circoviridae family. Both are single-stranded, non-enveloped DNA viruses of about 
      3800 nucleotides. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have a high risk of 
      blood-borne viral infections. SEN-V and TTV has been reported from a number of HD 
      units from various countries throughout the world. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 
      377 blood samples obtained from 150 healthy donors and 227 HD patients were 
      collected at the HD center. SEN-V and TTV DNA was determined by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) in all samples. RESULTS: TTV was detected in 109 (48.01%) of 227 
      hemodialysed patients and 14 (9.33%) of 150 voluntary blood donors (significant, 
      P<0.05). The PCR results for SEN-V-D/H DNA showed that 65 (28.63%) were positive for 
      SEN-V-D and 33 (14.53%) were positive for SEN-V-H. 9.69% of 227 patients were 
      positive for SEN-V-D/H co-infection. In the control group, SEN-V-D was detected in 
      14 (9.33%) and SEN-V-H was detected in 15 (10%) of the 150 (100%) blood donors. 
      CONCLUSION: These findings show that the prevalence of SEN-V-D/H and TTV is higher 
      than healthy blood donors. Also, these results indicate that the prevalence of SEN-V 
      and TTV infections in our region is similar with that in other countries.

TI  - New DNA viruses identified in patients with acute viral infection syndrome.
PG  - 8230-6
AB  - A sequence-independent PCR amplification method was used to identify viral nucleic 
      acids in the plasma samples of 25 individuals presenting with symptoms of acute 
      viral infection following high-risk behavior for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
      transmission. GB virus C/hepatitis G virus was identified in three individuals and 
      hepatitis B virus in one individual. Three previously undescribed DNA viruses were 
      also detected, a parvovirus and two viruses related to TT virus (TTV). Nucleic acids 
      in human plasma that were distantly related to bacterial sequences or with no 
      detectable similarities to known sequences were also found. Nearly complete viral 
      genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of a new 
      parvovirus distinct from known human and animal parvoviruses and of two related 
      TTV-like viruses highly divergent from both the TTV and TTV-like minivirus groups. 
      The detection of two previously undescribed viral species in a small group of 
      individuals presenting acute viral syndrome with unknown etiology indicates that a 
      rich yield of new human viruses may be readily identifiable using simple methods of 
      sequence-independent nucleic acid amplification and limited sequencing.

TI  - TT virus in Hungary: sequence heterogeneity and mixed infections.
PG  - 153-7
AB  - The majority of the viral hepatitis cases is caused by five hepatitis viruses 
      (A,B,C,D,E). In 1997, TT virus was discovered. It was supposed that a number of the 
      unknown hepatitis cases was caused by the TT virus. The aim of this study was to 
      characterize TT viruses carried by healthy individuals and patients suffering from 
      hepatitis of unknown origin in Hungary. TTV DNA was detected by seminested PCR with 
      the commonly used N22 primers. Twenty of the 108 sera (18.5%) taken from healthy 
      persons and 115 of the 228 sera (50.4%) of patients with hepatitis of unknown origin 
      were found to be positive. The nucleotide sequences of 26 clones derived from 17 
      hepatitis patients and 15 clones from nine healthy persons were determined and a 
      phylogenetic tree was constructed. Genotype 2 (group 1) was found to be the most 
      frequent, but other group 1 genotypes (1, 6) and genotypes 8 and 17 of group 2 were 
      also detected. Mixed TTV infections were found in eight cases (two healthy persons 
      and six hepatitis patients). Variants belonging to the same group were carried in 
      seven cases, and the presence of group 1 (genotype 2) and group 2 (genotype 8) TTV 
      sequences were found in one single hepatitis patient.

TI  - Effect of immune modulation on TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like-mini-virus (TLMV) 
      viremia.
PG  - 177-82
AB  - The present study was designed to investigate how two chronically replicating 
      viruses, TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV), interact with host defence 
      systems. Successive serum samples from three groups of subjects, undergoing 
      modifications of their antiviral defence, were tested by real-time PCR to measure 
      changes in viral titers, and by sequence analyses to indicate whether increases in 
      viremia could be attributed to infection with an unfamiliar strain: 1) in patients 
      receiving immunosuppressants subsequent to kidney transplantation, viral titers 
      tended to increase; 2) in soldiers undergoing extreme training known to cause 
      immunosuppression, insignificant increases in titers were observed; and 3) 
      interferon treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus caused a temporary decrease 
      in TTV and TLMV titers. Increases in viremia were associated only occasionally with 
      the appearance of novel strains. The above results add to knowledge on how these 
      viruses are influenced by the host.

TI  - Detection of transfusion transmitted virus DNA by real-time PCR.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: Little is known about the pathogenic role and the endemic situation of 
      transfusion transmitted virus (TTV). OBJECTIVES: In this study, a molecular assay 
      for detection of TTV based on automated nucleic acid extraction and real-time PCR 
      was developed and evaluated. The new assay includes an internal control. STUDY 
      DESIGN: After optimization of the molecular assay, 103 clinical samples were studied 
      retrospectively. All sera had been tested for anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1 antibodies 
      earlier. RESULTS: The amplification efficiency was found to be 102%. When clinical 
      specimens were tested, 79 of 103 serum samples were found to be positive for TTV. 
      There was no significant difference between various groups of patients. The internal 
      control was detected in all negative and weak positive samples. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      molecular assay proved to be suitable for routine detection of TTV in clinical 
      samples. Moreover, a relative statement on the TTV serum load can be done.

TI  - Frequency of hepatitis G virus and transfusion-transmitted virus infection in type 
      II diabetes mellitus.
PG  - 206-9
AB  - The hepatitis G virus (HGV) and transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) are recently 
      defined hepatitis viruses that the pathogenic roles in liver diseases are still not 
      clear. It has been well known that some hepatitis virus, such as hepatitis C, might 
      have an affinity to pancreatic islet cells. To investigate the relationship between 
      the newly defined hepatitis viruses and diabetes mellitus (DM), we studied the 
      prevalence of TTV and HGV in a type 2 diabetic patient population. Serum samples of 
      60 patients with DM and 45 healthy volunteers as control were taken. HGV RNA and TTV 
      DNA was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. HGV was detected in none of 
      diabetic patients (0%) and only one in control group (2.2%). However, TTV DNA was 
      detected in 16 patients with DM (26%) and in five controls (11%). TTV was more 
      prevalent in diabetic patients, but the difference between groups was not 
      statistically significant (p > 0.05). These results revealed that TTV is more common 
      in diabetic patients than in controls. At present, we don't know if this result is 
      only a coincidence or a sign of potential association between TTV and DM. Further 
      studies are certainly needed to elucidate a potential relationship.

TI  - Clinical & molecular characterization of human TT virus in different liver diseases.
PG  - 545-54
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered non-enveloped, single 
      stranded DNA virus of high genotypic variability, found frequently in patients with 
      acute or chronic hepatitis of non A-G aetiology. This study was carried out to look 
      for the presence of TTV and its genotypes in patients with different types of liver 
      diseases from northern India. METHODS: A total of 262 serum samples from patients of 
      acute viral hepatitis (AVH; n=72), fulminant hepatic failure (FHF; n=49), chronic 
      active hepatitis (CAH; n=93) and liver cirrhosis (LC; n=48), were analyzed for 
      hepatitis A-G viral markers. TTV DNA was detected in all cases by nested polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) using the primers from N22 and untranslated (UTR) region. 
      TTV-DNA was also tested in 150 volunteer blood donors. Direct nucleotide sequencing 
      of N22 amplicons were carried out to look into the prevalent TTV genotypes. RESULTS: 
      TTV-DNA was detected in 73.6, 59.2, 21.5 and 29.1 per cent cases with AVH, FHF, CAH 
      and cirrhosis, respectively. In AVH and FHF groups, TTV showed co-infection with all 
      A-G hepatitis cases whereas in CAH and cirrhosis groups, TTV co-infection observed 
      with HBV, HCV and HGV. TTV-DNA was detected in 45.3 per cent volunteer blood donors. 
      No statistically significant difference was observed amongst the mean liver function 
      profile of UTR PCR positive and negative cases in different liver disease groups 
      except AVH cases, in whom the various biochemical parameters between TTV positive 
      and TTV negative patients were marginally significant. However, no significant 
      evidence of biochemical or histological deterioration of the liver was observed in 
      TTV positive cases amongst FHF, CAH and cirrhosis. Predominance of genotype 1a was 
      observed in all the cases from north India. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: TTV is a 
      frequent virus isolated from patients with various types of liver diseases as well 
      as in healthy individuals from northern India. TTV has no effect on biochemical 
      markers of associated liver diseases. Genotype 1a was the most predominant type in 
      different liver disease groups. The occurrence of TTV did not further influence the 
      course of the disease.

TI  - Prevalence and genetic diversity of TT virus genotype 21 (YONBAN virus) in Brazil.
PG  - 517-29
AB  - Isolates of the newly characterized, single-stranded DNA virus TTV, have been 
      tentatively classified into four major phylogenetic groups and at least 28 
      genotypes. Four Japanese isolates, designated as YONBAN viruses, belong to the 
      fourth group and to genotype 21. In this study, a genotype 21-specific PCR assay was 
      standardized. With this assay, 48/184 (26%) serum samples and 76/167 (46%) saliva 
      samples, collected from unselected ambulatory patients (aged 2 to 82) of a Brazilian 
      public hospital, were positive. A total of 110 (66%) patients had TTV genotype 21 
      DNA in serum, saliva, or both fluids. Furthermore, 18/37 (49%) serum samples, 
      collected from Indians belonging to three ethnic groups of the Western Brazilian 
      Amazon, were also positive. Nucleotide sequences (253 bases at the 3' end of the 
      non-coding region of the genome) were determined, that derived from 25 individuals, 
      i.e. 17 patients and eight Indians. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three isolates 
      from Indians of a particular ethnic group formed a separate subgroup within genotype 
      21. Among non-Indians, a clustering of strains was observed according to their 
      country of origin (Japan or Brazil), with all 17 sequences derived from Brazilian 
      patients located in a unique subgroup.

TI  - Recognition of conserved amino acid motifs of common viruses and its role in 
      autoimmunity.
PG  - e41
LID - e41
AB  - The triggers of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) remain elusive. 
      Epidemiological studies suggest that common pathogens can exacerbate and also induce 
      MS, but it has been difficult to pinpoint individual organisms. Here we demonstrate 
      that in vivo clonally expanded CD4+ T cells isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of 
      a MS patient during disease exacerbation respond to a poly-arginine motif of the 
      nonpathogenic and ubiquitous Torque Teno virus. These T cell clones also can be 
      stimulated by arginine-enriched protein domains from other common viruses and 
      recognize multiple autoantigens. Our data suggest that repeated infections with 
      common pathogenic and even nonpathogenic viruses could expand T cells specific for 
      conserved protein domains that are able to cross-react with tissue-derived and 
      ubiquitous autoantigens.

TI  - TT virus is shown in the liver by in situ hybridization with a PCR-generated probe 
      from the serum TTV-DNA.
PG  - 424-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: It has been a conflicting issue whether TT virus (TTV), a newly 
      isolated DNA virus from a patient with liver injury of unknown cause, is a causative 
      agent of acute and/or chronic hepatitis. TT Virus DNA titers were shown to be 
      10-100-fold greater in liver tissue than in serum, whereas the majority of 
      TTV-positive cases had no biochemical or histological evidence of significant liver 
      damage. We therefore attempted in situ hybridization to investigate whether TTV is 
      hepatotropic. METHODS: Because of the marked divergence in TTV genome types, a 
      template for TTV-DNA (coding region for N22 clone) was amplified and labeled with 
      digoxigenin-dUTP by using hemi-nested PCR from the serum, then DNA probes were 
      applied to the liver sections of the same case. After hybridization, the probes were 
      visualized immunohistochemically. Besides TTV-DNA-negative cases, competitive 
      inhibition experiments with unlabeled probes were performed to confirm the 
      specificity. RESULTS: There were no positive signals in the negative controls, and 
      the intensity of positive signals was markedly diminished in the competitive 
      inhibition experiments. No cross-hybridization with different genotype probes also 
      confirms the specificity. Under the optimal conditions, the positive signals were 
      located in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes in eight of nine TTV-DNA-positive cases. 
      The signals were not seen in non-parenchymal cells of the liver. CONCLUSION: TT 
      Virus is proved to be hepatotropic by in situ hybridization.

TI  - TT virus loads and lymphocyte subpopulations in children with acute respiratory 
      diseases.
PG  - 9081-3
AB  - TT virus (TTV) produces chronic plasma viremia in around 90% of healthy individuals 
      of all ages and has, therefore, been proposed as a commensal human virus. We 
      recently demonstrated that in children hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases 
      high TTV loads were associated with severe forms of disease. Here, we report that in 
      such children TTV loads showed an inverse correlation with the percentage of 
      circulating total T and helper T cells and a direct correlation with the percentage 
      of B cells. Thus, florid TTV replication might contribute to lymphocyte imbalances 
      and, possibly, immunosuppressive effects, thus resembling related animal viruses.

TI  - Transfusion transmissible virus TTV and its putative role in the etiology of liver 
      disease.
PG  - 256-60
AB  - TTV, the transfusion transmissible hepatitis virus infects mainly patients at risk 
      for parenteral exposure and hence, prone to develop chronic liver disease, as well 
      as healthy populations worldwide. Most TTV infections appear to occur parenterally, 
      with viremia detected frequently in blood donors and blood products. The substantial 
      proportion of asymptomatic individuals never exposed to blood-borne agents, and its 
      high prevalence among healthy subjects implicates the fecal-oral route as another 
      potential for transmission. According to the TTV DNA levels detected in liver 
      tissue, it apparently replicates in hepatocytes, and TTV DNA is present in sera of 
      patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology closely correlated with 
      ALT levels. However, TTV initiating the development of chronic liver disease or 
      causing posttransfusion hepatitis could not be confirmed, as most patients positive 
      for TTV DNA remain asymptomatic and those progressing towards chronic liver disease 
      are invariably coinfected with either the hepatitis B or C virus. Also, TTV 
      coinfection does not aggravate the symptoms associated with hepatitis B or C. 
      Similarly, it does not cause posthepatitis aplastic anemia, and high-risk patients 
      can immunologically clear the viral DNA. In conclusion, being widely distributed and 
      apparently nonpathogenic, TTV might represent an opportunistic but innocent virus 
      reminiscent of hepatitis G virus, with a negligible role in the etiology of chronic 
      liver disease.

TI  - Detection of a novel porcine boca-like virus in the background of porcine circovirus 
      type 2 induced postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome.
PG  - 125-9
LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2009.09.006 [doi]
AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to be the causative agent of 
      postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous 
      virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not 
      develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of 
      PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of 
      PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of these factors and the 
      disease development has been found. In this study we explored the possible presence 
      of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected 
      from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through random amplification and 
      high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic 
      sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus 
      (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of TTV was expected since like PCV-2, 
      TTV has been found to have high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to 
      amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and 
      partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic 
      studies we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic 
      relationship to bocaviruses.

TI  - TT virus (TTV) loads associated with different peripheral blood cell types and 
      evidence for TTV replication in activated mononuclear cells.
PG  - 190-4
AB  - TT virus (TTV) loads associated with the peripheral blood cells of seven patients 
      known to carry the virus in plasma were investigated by real-time PCR. Whereas red 
      cells/platelets were uniformly negative, six and four patients yielded positive 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, 
      respectively, but viral titres were generally low. Fractionation of PBMCs into 
      monocyte- and B, T4, and T8 lymphocyte-enriched subpopulations showed no pattern in 
      the viral loads that might suggest the preferential association of TTV to one or 
      more specific cell types. TTV-negative PBMCs absorbed measurable amounts of virus 
      when incubated with infected plasma at 4 degrees C. Furthermore, cultures of 
      TTV-negative phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs exposed in vitro to virus-positive 
      plasma and faecal extracts released considerable levels of infectious TTV into the 
      supernatant fluid and the same was true for TTV-positive stimulated PBMCs. These 
      results indicate that, whereas freshly harvested resting PBMCs seem to produce 
      little, if any TTV, stimulated PBMCs actively replicate the virus.

AB  - In 239 torquetenovirus-positive people, multiple-genogroup infections were common 
      and associated with higher viral loads than would be expected from simple additive 
      effects. The latter observation was restricted to the infections which included both 
      genogroups 1 and 3, pointing to the possible existence of some kind of infection 
      facilitation between these genogroups.

TI  - Relationship of TT virus and Helicobacter pylori infections in gastric tissues of 
      patients with gastritis.
PG  - 160-5
AB  - Blood and gastric tissue biopsies of 34 patients with gastritis were tested for the 
      presence of TT virus (TTV), a ubiquitous virus found in the blood of most humans. 
      Thirty-one of these patients were TTV positive, and 27 patients had virus in both 
      tissues. In addition, 13 of the patients who had TTV in gastric tissue were 
      Helicobacter pylori positive. There was an association of higher TTV titers in 
      gastric tissues of patients who were H. pylori positive than in those in whom the 
      bacterium could not be detected. Furthermore, this association was stronger in H. 
      pylori-positive patients with the presence of the cagA protein. Of 10 specimens in 
      which genogroup determination was carried out in the gastric corpus, 5/5 that were 
      H. pylori positive showed the presence of TTV genogroup 3, while for those that were 
      H. pylori negative, 5/5 showed the presence of genogroup 1t. By contrast, genogroup 
      1 was found in the corpus of only one H. pylori-positive patient, and genogroup 3 in 
      only one H. pylori-negative patient. The histological severity of gastritis did 
      correlate significantly with loads in the gastric tissues. There was no significant 
      difference in TTV titer in blood of patients regardless of H. pylori infection 
      status. These findings pique interest in clarifying the role of TTV, alone or in 
      association with H. pylori infection, in the pathogenesis of gastritis.

TI  - Presence of TT virus DNA in bone marrow cells from hematologic patients.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - Recent observations suggest that TT virus (TTV), in addition to liver, may also 
      infect bone marrow. In this study, bone marrow samples and sera from 33 patients 
      with haematological disorders and sera from 16 healthy controls were investigated 
      for TTV DNA presence. Altogether TTV DNA sequences were demonstrated in bone marrow 
      cells of 84.84% of patients. Moreover TTV DNA was detected in sera from 72.72% of 
      patients and from 93.75% of controls. N22 sequences amplified from bone marrow cells 
      and serum of 3 patients were analysed, after cloning: all these isolates were of 
      type 2c and 2 or 3 variants were present in each isolate. After single strand DNA 
      degradation, replicative forms were detectable in BM cells. This finding, in 
      addition to the detection of variants similar in the BM and in the serum of the same 
      patient could suggest that BM is a site of TTV replication (or one of the sites) 
      from which the virus is spread in blood.

TI  - Persisting TT virus (TTV) genogroup 1 variants in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 841-51
AB  - TT virus (TTV) genogroup 1 infection has an increased prevalence in solid organ 
      transplant recipients. In this study, the presence of TTV in renal transplant 
      recipients was examined by two PCR methods, one capable of detecting most TTV 
      genotypes (UTR-PCR), the other specific to genogroup 1 (N22-PCR). The N22-PCR 
      detected TTV in 57% (53/92) of the renal transplant patients and in 20% (13/66) of 
      the healthy individuals, while the prevalence of TTV with the UTR-PCR was above 90% 
      in both the control and the patient groups. The N22-PCR was used in longitudinal 
      studies of 31 renal transplant recipients, these PCR products were sequenced and 
      aligned. TTV status was not associated with the patients' age at transplantation, 
      male to female ratio and the time lag between kidney transplantation and the TTV 
      test. During the follow-up consistent TTV status was found in 26 patients, while two 
      initially TTV positive patients converted to negative and three initially negative 
      patients converted to positive. The TTV variants varied among the tested patients, 
      but were the same in the consecutive samples of each patient, indicating that TTV 
      infection was persistent in renal transplant recipients and novel infection occurred 
      rarely in the post-transplant period.

TI  - Genoprevalence in human tissues of TT-virus genotype 6.
PG  - 1095-106
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered human virus of high genotypic diversity. TTV is 
      widely distributed among humans, but the possible genotype-related differences in 
      TTV biology are not well known. The prevalence and amount of TTV-DNA, especially of 
      genotype 6, was determined by nested-PCR in various human tissues, and human 
      parvovirus B19, another ssDNA virus, was used as a reference. TTV DNA was detected 
      simultaneously in bile, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma of 77% 
      subjects, in 38% skin samples, in 38% synovial samples and in all (100%) adenoids, 
      tonsils and liver samples. The relative concentrations of TTV-DNA did not vary 
      significantly among the different samples. Genotype 6 TTV-DNA was detected in bile 
      and plasma of one subject (3%), in skin and serum of one subject (8%) and in one 
      liver (5%). The overall prevalence of TTV genotype 6 was 4% in subjects and 4% in 
      sera. TTV genotype 6 was shown to occur in human tissues with no obvious tissue-type 
      or symptom specificity. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected overall in 38% subjects, and 
      bile was the only sample type tested that did not persistently harbour B19 DNA.

TI  - Prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) genotypes among HCC patients in 
      Qaluobia governorate.
PG  - 135
AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) is a novel single-stranded DNA virus 
      that was identified in patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of non-A-G type. 
      Clinical significance of TTV infection was analyzed in Egyptian hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC) patients. The present study attempted to clarify these issues in 
      Egypt, particularly in Qaluobia governorate, a country known for its high endemicity 
      of liver disease and hepatotropic viruses. METHODS: TTV are determined in the serum 
      of 60 samples obtained from HCC and liver cirrhosis (LC) patients and 30 healthy 
      individuals. TTV DNA is amplified by nested-PCR with TTV-specific mixed primers 
      derived from the conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region followed by digestion 
      with restriction enzyme. Using the enzymes HaeIII, DraI, EcoRI and PstI, we are able 
      to distinguish between the four TTV genotypes. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV 
      detection was 46.7%, 40% and 36.7% among HCC, LC patients and healthy individuals 
      respectively. The more prevalence genotype was detected in the positive serum 
      samples was genotype 1 (35.7%) in HCC patients, (50%) in LC and (63.3%) in healthy 
      individuals, Genotype 5 (21.4%), (25.5%) and (18.2%) in HCC, LC and healthy 
      individuals respectively. DISCUSSION: This study indicates that TTV is commonly 
      present in adult patients with HCC and LC as well as healthy individuals. The most 
      prevalence TTV genotype is genotype 1. It seems that the infection neither 
      contribute to the severity of liver disease no to the causation of HCC.

TI  - Molecular characterisation of SENV and TTV infections in hepatopathic 
      liver-transplant patients. Brief Report.
PG  - 1423-33
AB  - The presence of SENV and TTV infections among 50 patients who had undergone liver 
      transplantation was evaluated. UTR amplification showed that 46 (92%) sera were 
      positive. ORF-1 amplification showed that 25 (50%) patients were positive for either 
      SENV (51.3%), TTV (10.8%), or both (37.8%) all confirmed by sequencing and 
      phylogenetic analysis. SENV-D and SENV-H were the most prevalent viruses. The 
      phylogenetic analysis of isolates showed that whereas SENV-D and SENV-G viruses 
      showed sequence stability and strain persistence, SENV-H had cleared or mutated. 
      Biological differences seem to exist among different genotypes in terms of viral 
      replication and their persistence.

TI  - [Newly discovered hepatitis viruses--do they cause hepatitis indeed?].
PG  - 1569-74
AB  - The paper reviews the available information on the newly discovered viruses 
      originally supposed to cause post-transfusion hepatitis. GBV-C/Hepatitis G virus 
      belongs to the Flaviviridae family, and can be transmitted parenterally like 
      Hepatitis C virus. Its role in causing hepatitis or other diseases has not been 
      proved yet. The other newly discovered viruses contain single-stranded circular DNA, 
      with a wide range of sequence divergence. These viruses can be transmitted not only 
      with blood and blood products but via fecal-oral route as well. They are unique 
      among enterally transmitted viruses in the sense that the virus persists for years 
      in the human body, therefore their genomes may be detected in the blood of the 
      healthy population in high percentage. One of the genotypes of TTV is suspected to 
      cause hepatitis. High TT virus load was found as an independent factor associated 
      with the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with hepatitis C 
      virus-related chronic liver disease. It is not clear yet, whether TTV-like minivirus 
      and SEN virus cause any illnesses.

TI  - Mother-to-infant vertical transmission of transfusion transmitted virus in South 
      China.
PG  - 404-6
AB  - A nested PCR was used to detect TTV DNA in serum from 490 mother-infant pairs to 
      determine the rate of vertical transmission of TTV in Guangzhou City, P.R. China. 
      TTV DNA was positive in 87 mothers and 12 of their babies, giving a prevalence of 
      17.8% in pregnant women and a mother-to-child transmission rate of 13.8%. In eight 
      mother-infant pairs, TTV DNA nucleotide sequences from the mothers and their 
      corresponding infants were identical. The homology of Guangzhou TTV and Japanese TTV 
      ranged from 85.3%-98.2% at nucleotide level. TTV infection is common in pregnant 
      women in South China and vertical transmission can occur. Guangzhou's and Japanese 
      TTV isolates belong to the same genotype.

TI  - TT virus contaminates first-generation recombinant factor VIII concentrates.
PG  - 2571-3
AB  - Recombinant factor VIII and factor IX concentrates, human-plasma-derived albumin, 
      and samples from previously untreated patients with hemophilia were examined for the 
      presence of TT virus (TTV) by using polymerase chain reaction testing. Blood samples 
      from the patients were obtained prospectively before and every 3 to 6 months after 
      therapy was begun. TTV was detected in 23.5% of the recombinant-product lots and 
      55.5% of the albumin lots tested. Only first-generation factor VIII recombinant 
      concentrates stabilized with human albumin were positive for TTV, whereas all 
      second-generation (human protein-free) concentrates were negative for the virus. In 
      59% of patients treated with either first- or second-generation recombinant factor 
      concentrates, TTV infection developed at some point after the initial infusion. 
      Infection with TTV in these patients before and after treatment did not appear to be 
      clinically important. Thus, first-generation recombinant factor VIII concentrates 
      may contain TTV and the source of the viral contamination may be human albumin.

TI  - TT virus prevalence, viral loads and genotypic variability in saliva from healthy 
      Japanese children.
PG  - 1686-90
LID - 10.1111/j.1651-2227.2008.00962.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: TT virus (TTV) is genetically variable and widespread without apparent 
      pathogenicity; however, its epidemiological features in children were not fully 
      understood, partly because blood sampling is often unacceptable for healthy 
      children. We therefore used saliva specimens to investigate epidemiology of TTV 
      infection in early childhood. METHODS: Saliva samples were collected from 83 
      1-month-old, 110 4-month-old and 49 42-month-old children. Peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and saliva samples were obtained in pairs from 19 healthy 
      adults aged 40 +/- 7 years. TTV DNA was detected and quantified by real-time PCR and 
      classified into five genogroups (G1-G5) by a series of PCRs using genogroup-specific 
      primer pairs. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 6, 34 and 90% of children aged 1, 4 
      and 42 months, respectively, and in 84% of adults. Comparable levels of TTV DNA were 
      detected in pairs of saliva and PBMC. TTV loads in saliva were much higher in 
      children than in adults. G3 was the most common genogroup in all age groups. The 
      second most prevalent was G4 at 1-4 months of age and G1 thereafter. CONCLUSION: The 
      prevalence of TTV infection reached a plateau at or before 42 months; however, 
      somehow different epidemiologic features were observed among genogroups.

TI  - SEN virus genotype H distribution in β-thalassemic patients and in healthy donors in

PG  - e0007880

LID - e0007880
AB  - The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis; 
      however, information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia, 
      particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections, remains limited. This 
      study investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqi 
      patients with thalassemic patients infected and not infected with hepatitis C virus. 
      The study involved 150 β-thalassemia patients (75 with HCV infections and 75 
      without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E, liver 
      function markers, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined. Recovered viral 
      nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (SENV 
      DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA) techniques. Only 10% of 
      healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Among patients with thalassemia, 80% 
      and 77% of patients with and without concurrent HCV infections, respectively, had 
      SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses were performed on blood samples obtained 
      from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia, particularly those with SENV 
      infections, had higher levels of several enzymatic liver function markers and total 
      serum bilirubin (P < 0.05) than did healthy blood donors. Among the examined liver 
      function markers, only gamma-glutamyl transferase demonstrated significantly higher 
      levels in HCV-negative patients infected with SENV-H than in those infected with 
      SENV-D (P = 0.01). There were significantly lower vitamin C, vitamin E, and 
      glutathione peroxidase levels in patients than in healthy donors (P < 0.05), but 
      only glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly lower in HCV-negative 
      thalassemia patients infected with SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 
      0.04). The SENV-H genotype sequences were similar to the global standard genes in 
      GenBank. These results broaden our understanding the nature of the SENV-H genotype 
      and the differential role of SENV-H infections, compared to SENV-D infections, in 
      patients with thalassemia, in Iraq.

TI  - The prevalence of TT virus and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus infection in individuals 
      with raised liver enzymes but without HBV or HCV infection in Taiwan.
PG  - 307-13
AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) and GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) 
      infection and the association with raised liver function tests in 546 Taiwanese with 
      negative HBsAg, anti-HCV and HCV RNA was elucidated. They were tested for serum 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-envelope protein 2 antibody 
      (anti-E2) and TTV DNA. Direct sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed on 
      58 isolates for TTV genotype determination. The prevalence of TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV 
      RNA, anti-E2 and over all GBV-C/HGV exposure was 24.9, 3.4, 8.2 and 11.1%, 
      respectively. Using uni- and multi-variate analyses, male gender and TTV viremia 
      were associated significantly with raised ALT values. Sixty-nine percent of TTV 
      isolates were deduced to be TTV genotype 1 and they had significantly lower mean age 
      than genotype non-1 isolates. In the population, raised ALT may be related to male 
      gender and be attributable to TTV infection but not to GBV-C/HGV among individuals 
      with no evidence of current HBV and HCV infection. TTV genotype 1 is the most 
      prevalent genotype and associated with younger age.

TI  - Cervicovaginal shedding of TT virus in HIV-infected women.
PG  - 343-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: TT virus (TTV) is frequently detected in the serum and in other body 
      fluids of humans. Recently TTV-specific deoxyribonucleic acid has been detected in 
      cervical specimens from apparently healthy women and in seminal fluid, suggesting 
      that sexual transmission may be common. STUDY DESIGN/METHODS: TT 
      virus-deoxyribonucleic acid prevalence was assessed in paired samples of blood and 
      cervical smears from 110 human immunodeficiency virus-positive women. Detection and 
      typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) present in cervical smears was also performed. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV-deoxyribonucleic acid in cervical smears was 16.4%, 
      without significant difference (p = 0.81) between HPV-positive (18.6%) and -negative 
      (14.9%) samples. The distribution of high/middle and low-risk HPV types was similar 
      in TTV-positive and -negative samples. On the contrary, women with multiple HPV 
      infections had a significantly higher TTV-deoxyribonucleic acid prevalence (60.0%) 
      than HPV-negative women (p = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: TT virus excretion in the female 
      genital tract of human immunodeficiency virus-infected women is common, further 
      supporting sexual transmission of this virus.

AB  - In order to verify the microbial quality of the influents and effluents of one STP 
      from southern Brazil, an eight-month survey was conducted to examine the presence of 
      total and fecal coliforms and of adenovirus (HAdV), enterovirus (EV), genogroup A 
      rotaviruses (GARV) and Torque teno virus (TTV), in treated effluent samples from São 
      João/Navegantes STP, Porto Alegre (Brazil). A total of 16 samples were collected, 
      eight of influent (raw sewage, prior to treatment), and the other eight of the 
      effluent (post-treatment sewage). Total and fecal coliform levels ranging from 3.6 × 
      10(4) to 4.4 × 10(7) MPN/100 mL and 2.9 × 10(3) to 1.7 × 10(7) MPN/100 mL, were 
      detected in all samples. In raw sewage, HAdV (25%) and GARV (28.6%) viral genomes 
      were detected. The analysis of effluent samples revealed the presence of HAdV (50%), 
      EV (37.5%), and TTV (12.5%) genomic fragments. All samples, regardless of the month 
      analysed, presented detection of a least one virus genus, except for in April. 
      Higher virus detection rates were observed in treated sewage samples (62.5%), and in 
      80% of them (effluent positive samples) HAdV was detected. Results showed that 
      improvements in sewage monitoring and treatment processes are necessary to reduce 
      the viral and bacterial load on the environment in southern Brazil. To the knowledge 
      of the authors, this is the first study showing the monitoring of viral genomes in 
      influent and effluent samples from a STP located in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, 
      Brazil), southern Brazil.

TI  - Prevalence and assessment of role of SEN virus in acute and chronic hepatitis in 
      India.
PG  - 227-34
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: SEN virus (SENV), is a recently discovered single-stranded DNA 
      virus of Annelloviridae family and is believed may play a role in non A-E hepatitis. 
      We conducted this study to identify the prevalence and clinical association of SENV 
      with acute and chronic hepatitis. METHODS: 135 liver disease patients were studied. 
      Extent of liver damage was assessed using the Model for End Stage Liver Disease 
      (MELD) score. A-E viruses and HIV were detected by enzyme immunoassay. Nested PCR 
      was performed for detection of SENV and its genotypes D and H. RESULTS: 34 cases 
      (25.18%) were positive for SEN virus DNA, a statistically significant finding (p < 
      0.01) of which 22 (64%) had acute viral hepatitis, 4 (11.76%) had chronic viral 
      hepatitis, 3 (8.82%) fulminant hepatic failure and 5 (14.70%) cirrhosis. Mean AST 
      was 47.85 IU/L, ALT 51.2 IU/L and INR 1.73, mean MELD score was 18.38 (11 to 24). 
      17.64% had severely deranged MELD score. SENV-D genotype was detected in 13 (38%) 
      and SENV-H in 19 (58%) cases. SENV-H occurred in both acute (53%) and chronic 
      hepatitis (47%). SENV-D was strongly associated with acute hepatitis (85%). 
      Cirrhotic and FHF cases were SENV-H positive. 12 (44.11%) were co-infected with HBV, 
      5 (14.7%) with TTV, 4(11.76%) with HEV, 2 (5.88%) with HCV and 5 (14.4%) with HIV. 
      CONCLUSION: Significant prevalence of SENV in hepatitis patients was observed. On 
      the basis of clinical findings and abnormal liver function tests, we conclude that 
      SENV appears to be not only hepatotropic but also capable of liver damage. Higher 
      prevalence of SENV-H in cirrhotics may point to its possible role in the development 
      of cirrhosis.

TI  - TT virus in the nasal secretions of children with acute respiratory diseases: 
      relations to viremia and disease severity.
PG  - 2418-25
AB  - The natural history and pathogenic potential of the recently identified TT virus 
      (TTV) are currently a matter of intensive investigation. In an attempt to shed some 
      light on these issues, nasal and blood specimens of 1- to 24-month-old children 
      hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory disease (ARD) were 
      examined for the presence, load, and genetic characteristics of TTV. The results 
      have indicated that at least in young children, the respiratory tract not only 
      represents a route by which abundant TTV can be shed into the environment but also 
      may be a site of primary infection and continual replication. Although we found no 
      compelling evidence that TTV was the direct cause of ARD in some of the children 
      studied, the average loads of TTV were considerably higher in patients with 
      bronchopneumonia (BP) than in those with milder ARD, raising interesting questions 
      about the pathophysiological significance of TTV at this site. Furthermore, group 4 
      TTV was detected almost exclusively in children with BP.

TI  - High carriage rate of TT virus in the cervices of pregnant women.
PG  - 1376-7
AB  - Prevalence studies of the recently identified TT virus (TTV) have suggested that 
      parenteral transmission is a common route of infection, but other routes also appear 
      likely. In this study, a high rate of cervical carriage (66%) of TTV DNA was found 
      by polymerase chain reaction, which suggests that perinatal and sexual transmission 
      is possible.

TI  - Highly diverse TTV population in infants and their mothers.
PG  - 183-8
AB  - Infants born to serum HCV-positive 12 mothers were enrolled in the study. Nucleotide 
      sequences amplified by primers deduced from a noncoding region were compared between 
      mothers and their infants. The rates for detection of serum TTV in 12 mothers and 
      their infants were 10/12 (83%) and 9/12 (75%), respectively. Serum TTV DNA was not 
      detected in any infant at 1 month of age, but was detected for the first time 
      between 1.5 and 8 months after birth. Positivity persisted thereafter throughout the 
      follow-up period. In seven randomly selected mother-infant pairs, intrahost TTV 
      heterogeneity was lower in infants than in mothers. Furthermore, one of seven 
      mother-infant pairs showed a high degree of similarity (98.7-100%) in all clones, 
      while in four infants, all nucleotide sequences differed by >10% from those of their 
      mothers. However, the degree of homology in the two mother-infant pairs was 89-98.7% 
      in family 2 and 88.1-99.4% in family 5. In the present study, with only one 
      exception, it was shown that TTV from infants is not identical to TTV from mothers. 
      The mechanism is discussed briefly in this paper.

TI  - Human circovirus TT virus genotype 6 expresses six proteins following transfection 
      of a full-length clone.
PG  - 6505-10
AB  - The expression profile of the circovirus TTV has not yet been fully characterized. 
      In this paper, we show that following transfection of a full-length viral clone of 
      TTV genotype 6, each of the three virally encoded mRNAs is translated from two 
      initiating AUGs, and therefore, the TTV genome generates at least six proteins. 
      Localization studies of hemagglutinin-tagged versions of these proteins in fixed 
      cells, and green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of these proteins in living 
      cells, expressed following transfection, demonstrated that two were primarily 
      nuclear, two were primarily cytoplasmic, and two were found throughout the cell.

TI  - Associations between nasal torquetenovirus load and spirometric indices in children 
      with asthma.
PG  - 1141-8
AB  - Fifty-nine children with well-controlled, mild to moderate persistent asthma were 
      studied for the presence and load of torquetenovirus (TTV) in nasal fluid. Rates of 
      TTV positivity and mean nasal TTV loads were not dissimilar to those observed in the 
      general population and in a group of 30 age- and residence-matched healthy control 
      children without a history of asthmatic disease. However, in the children with 
      asthma, 3 important indices of lung function--forced expiratory flow (FEF) in which 
      25% and 75% of forced vital capacity (FVC) is expired (FEF(25%-75%)), forced 
      expiratory volume in 1 s/FVC, and FEF(25%-75%)/FVC--showed an inverse correlation 
      with nasal TTV load. Furthermore, signs of reduced airflow were more frequent in the 
      children with asthma who had high nasal TTV loads (> or =6 log(10) DNA copies/mL of 
      nasal fluid) than they were in those who had low nasal TTV loads (<6 log(10) DNA 
      copies/mL of nasal fluid), despite similar therapy regimens. In contrast, the 
      control children showed no associations between nasal TTV load and the spirometric 
      indices. Levels of eosinophil cationic protein in sputum were also greater in the 
      children with asthma who had higher nasal viral burdens than they were in those who 
      had lower nasal viral burdens. These findings are the first report of TTV infection 
      status in children with asthma and suggest that TTV might be a contributing factor 
      in the lung impairment caused by this condition.

TI  - TT virus has a ubiquitous diffusion in human body tissues: analyses of paired serum 
      and tissue samples.
PG  - 95-102
AB  - The tissue tropism and possible correlation with liver disease of the TT virus (TTV) 
      as well as its prevalence and genotype distribution remain undefined. TTV-DNA was 
      investigated in paired sera and tissue samples from 144 patients, and sera and 
      cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from additional six subjects. Of the 144 tissue samples, 
      128 were liver biopsy specimens from subjects with hepatic disease while 16 were 
      surgically obtained nonliver specimens from patients with extrahepatic disease. TTV 
      cloning, sequencing and genotype analyses were performed on isolates from sera, 
      tissue specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients with hepatic 
      and four patients with extrahepatic pathologies, as well as from sera and CSFs of 
      two subjects. TTV was found in 100% of the examined tissues and in 60.1 and 50% of 
      sera from patients with hepatic and extrahepatic pathologies, respectively. 
      Moreover, TTV was detected in four of the six CSFs analysed but only in two 
      correspondent sera. Genotyping revealed the coexistence of multiple TTV genotypes 
      and genetic variants in each infected individual, and the analysis of TTV mRNA 
      showed the presence of transcripts in all the six different tissues studied. These 
      results indicate that the entire adult population in our area is more likely 
      infected by TTV, although several subjects are not viraemic and that TTV infects 
      many different human tissues and is able to invade the central nervous system.

TI  - Genomic characterization of a Brazilian TT virus isolate closely related to SEN 
      virus-F.
PG  - 301-6
AB  - SEN virus (SENV) is a circular, single stranded DNA virus that has been first 
      characterized in the serum of a human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected 
      patient. Eight genotypes of SENV (A-H) have been identified and further recognized 
      as variants of TT virus (TTV) in the family Circoviridae. Here we describe the first 
      genomic characterization of a SENV isolate (5-A) from South America. Using 
      'universal' primers, able to amplify most, if not all, TTV/SENV genotypes, a segment 
      of > 3 kb was amplified by polymerase chain reaction from the serum of an HIV-1 
      infected patient. The amplicon was cloned and a 3087-nucleotide sequence was 
      determined, that showed a high (85%) homology with the sequence of the Italian 
      isolate SENV-F. Proteins encoded by open reading frames (ORFs) 1 to 4 consisted of 
      758, 129, 276, and 267 amino acids, respectively. By phylogenetic analysis, isolate 
      5-A was classified into TTV genotype 19 (phylogenetic group 3), together with SENV-F 
      and TTV isolate SAa-38.

TI  - Novel variants related to TT virus distributed widely in China.
PG  - 118-26
AB  - TTV is a DNA virus with high genetic heterogeneity. To investigate the novel 
      isolates of the virus, blood samples were collected from subjects who lived in 
      various parts of China and suffered from hepatitis or were asymptomatic carriers. 
      Nested PCR was carried out to amplify a 3.2-kb fragment using primers deduced from 
      the prototype TTV (TA278). The ten entire 3.2-kb nt sequences were aligned with 
      isolate TA278, SANBAN, TUS01, and SENV retrieved from GenBank, and a phylogenetic 
      tree was constructed by Neighbor-Joining method. The analysis indicated that five 
      novel variants of the present study have not been described before, and all 
      TTV-related isolates could be classified into three groups. The isolate TCHN-A, B 
      and TUS01 were included in a group, and the remaining novel isolates together with 
      SANBAN and TA278 clustered into another group, while SEN virus formed a distinct 
      group. The genetic distances of the five novel variants were 0.5507-0.8476 to TA278, 
      0.4635-0.7877 to SANBAN, 0.6064-0.7834 to TUS01 and 0.6936-0.8236 to SENV. Of these 
      novel variants, the ORF1 consisted of 426-772 aa and ORF2 of 141-156 aa. The nt 
      identities of ORF1 and ORF2 between those variants and TA278, SANBAN, and TUS01 were 
      46.1-60.8 and 48.7-63.6%, and those of aa sequences were only 27.1-52.4 and 
      28.9-45.5%, respectively. The first 65 aa of ORF1 were rich in arginine and most 
      conserved with homology of 56.5-70.0%. There was a hypervariable region from aa 286 
      to 403 with merely 17.7-27.0% of identity. Despite a low aa identity between TA278 
      and the variants, they have similar hydrophilicity profiles of ORF1. There were 2-10 
      N-glycosylation motifs found in these variants. In conclusion, despite the high 
      divergence, sequences of all these isolates shared common genome organisation, ORF 
      structure, hydrophilicity patterns, and some potential motifs with TTV prototype. It 
      is suggested that various TTV and TTV-related isolates belong to a very large and 
      complex family, which remains to be studied.

TI  - Mother-to-infant transmission of multiple blood-borne viral infections from 
      multi-infected mothers.
PG  - 743-7
AB  - Infants born from mothers with multiple blood-borne viral infections are at risk of 
      multiple transmissions. Whether the risk of transmission of multiple infections 
      increases with the number of viruses infecting the mother is still unknown. The aim 
      of this study was to describe the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of multiple 
      infections from multi-infected mothers. Sixty-four pregnant women infected by at 
      least two viruses among human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C 
      virus, TT virus, and GB virus type C, together with their 64 infants, were studied. 
      Maternal blood samples were collected in the third trimester of pregnancy and all 
      infants were prospectively followed for evaluation of transmission within 3 months 
      after birth and two times in the subsequent 24 months. Transmission of single and of 
      dual infection from mothers infected by two viruses was, respectively, 10/40 (25%) 
      and 5/40 (12.5%) and from mothers infected by three viruses 9/20 (45%) and 2/20 
      (10%). One (25%) infant infected by one virus was born from the four mothers 
      infected by four viruses. Transmission of single or dual infection was not 
      significantly associated with the number of viruses infecting the mother (P = 0.9) 
      in the linear regression analysis. Present study suggests the absence of a 
      synergistic effect from viral interactions toward mother-to-infant transmission of 
      multiple infections and supports the hypothesis that transmission from 
      multi-infected mothers is the result of the specific interaction between each virus 
      and the host. These observations may be of clinical relevance in perinatal 
      counseling.

TI  - TT virus replicates in stimulated but not in nonstimulated peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells.
PG  - 121-9
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is an unenveloped, single-stranded, circular-DNA virus which 
      resembles members of the Circoviridae, that is commonly found in humans and which 
      lacks pathological consequences for the infected host. TTV replication has been 
      demonstrated in bone marrow cells but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMC), suggesting that hematopoietic cells must be activated to support TTV 
      replication. To test this hypothesis, PBMC from two naturally TTV-infected 
      individuals and from two healthy TTV-DNA negative donors infected in vitro with a 
      TTV-DNA-positive serum were cultured in the presence (stimulated) or absence 
      (unstimulated) of phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-2. TTV-DNA 
      was detected in both stimulated and unstimulated PBMC. However, TTV-DNA replicative 
      intermediates and mRNA were detected only in stimulated PBMC. Furthermore, TTV-DNA 
      and mRNA were detected in PBMC from two TTV negative donors reinfected with 
      supernatants from TTV-infected stimulated cells but not when using culture 
      supernatants from unstimulated cells. These results demonstrate that TTV replicates 
      in PBMC only when stimulated.

TI  - Detection of TT virus among chimpanzees in the wild using a noninvasive technique.
PG  - 230-7
AB  - Zoonotic transmission and emergence of pathogens are serious threats to endangered 
      populations of free-ranging primate species. Recent discovery of a nonpathogenic yet 
      highly prevalent virus in human populations, TT virus (TTV), has prompted studies 
      into the presence of this virus among captive individuals of other species of 
      nonhuman primates. In this study, we screened captive primate species for TTV. In 
      addition, we provide the first data on TTV infectionin free-ranging primates by 
      noninvasive screening of three chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes sweinfurthii) 
      commlunities. Phylogenetic relationships between virus isolates and those previously 
      reported from hulman popullations, captive primates, and domesticated species are 
      inferred. Our findings are discussed with respect to potential zoonotic events that 
      may result from increased levels of human encroachlment into wild habitats.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationship between the complete genomic sequences of ten Japanese 
      and one French isolate of TT virus-like mini virus (TLMV) was investigated. Analysis 
      of the variability of the nucleotide sequences and the detection of signature 
      patterns for overlapping genes suggested that ORFs 1 and 2 are probably functional. 
      However, this was not the case for a putative third ORF, ORF3. Throughout the viral 
      genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs that are conserved in circoviruses 
      such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anaemia virus were identified. Phylogenetic 
      analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMV and allowed the identification of 
      putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were 
      detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also 
      identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, faeces and saliva. A phylogenetic 
      study of 37 TLMV strains originating from France, Japan and Brazil showed that 
      groupings were not related to geographical origin.

TI  - Phylogenetic classification of TT virus groups based on the N22 region is 
      unreliable.
PG  - 47-59
AB  - Evolutionary studies on the recently discovered TT virus (TTV) are currently focused 
      on approximately 220 nts of the N22 region, since this is the region for which most 
      sequence information is available. Regarding the extensive sequence heterogeneity in 
      this region, within group classification can be sufficiently reliable, however, 
      between group classification becomes problematic. We observed high divergence at the 
      nucleotide level between distant related strains (TTV groups) preventing unambiguous 
      alignments, saturation in transitions within TTV groups and considerable 
      phylogenetic noise due to conflicting signals within distinct genotypes. 
      Consequently, analysing all TTV groups in one tree, using this 220 nt region 
      provides unreliable results. Also within genotype analysis can produce conflicting 
      results. On the other hand, this region is still suitable to some extent for within 
      TTV group phylogenetic analysis. We suggest that care should be taken in future TTV 
      phylogenetic analysis, in particular, larger and more conserved regions should be 
      sequenced to allow between group comparisons.

TI  - Pathogenic significance and organic virus levels in patients infected with TT virus.
PG  - 291-7
AB  - Previous reports documented the recovery of a DNA virus from a patient with 
      posttransfusion non-A-G hepatitis and named TT virus (TTV). Although the virus was 
      initially detected as a causative agent of hepatitis, there is doubt about its 
      pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between TTV and 
      liver diseases. Histopathological examination of liver biopsies from 14 patients 
      with TTV genotype 1 positive non-B, non-C and non-G chronic hepatitis showed mild 
      fibrosis and periportal/piecemeal necrosis. Using the real-time detection (RTD)-PCR 
      method, we found that TTV DNA levels of genotype 1 in liver samples from 3 such 
      patients were 100- to 1,000-fold higher than those in the paired serum samples. 
      Further investigation using various tissues from 2 autopsies of patients with 
      hepatitis C with hepatocellular carcinoma revealed that the concentrations of TTV 
      DNA in the liver were also higher than in serum samples. However, the highest TTV 
      DNA concentrations in these 2 autopsies were found in the lung and bone marrow, 
      respectively. Our results suggest that TTV may replicate in various tissues 
      including the liver and may cause only mild liver damage.

AB  - A panel of gastroenteritis outbreak samples was subjected to a virus purification 
      and concentration algorithm followed by a sequence-independent amplification method 
      devised to detect viral enteric pathogens. The application of these methods allowed 
      the identification of torque teno virus (TTV) in one outbreak. The complete genome 
      sequence of 3,260 nt was obtained through "genome walking", and four open reading 
      frames were deduced from the genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analysis grouped this 
      virus in TTV genetic group 3, clustering with genotype 27, with 85% similarity at 
      the nt level with strain SAa-01.

TI  - High prevalence of TT virus in human bile juice samples: importance of secretion 
      through bile into feces.
PG  - 457-62
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is much more prevalent than we once imagined. With the use of primers 
      designed from the noncoding regions, a more than 90% rate of TTV infection in the 
      general population by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been reported, showing 
      that nonparenteral transmission must play an important role to its epidemiology. We 
      considered that TTV may be secreted through bile juice into feces to establish 
      nonparenteral infection. Paired bile juice and serum samples were obtained from 26 
      patients who were receiving bile drainage. Feces were also recovered after the 
      drainage tube was removed. TTV DNA was detected from 22 patients in serum (84.6%), 
      and they were all TTV DNA positive in bile juice. Most feces samples recovered from 
      TTV-positive patients were also TTV DNA positive. Secretion of TTV into bile juice 
      appears to be common, and this could play an important role to its transmission and 
      its epidemiology.

TI  - TT virus: preferential distribution in CD19(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      and lack of viral integration.
PG  - 276-84
AB  - In order to determine whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) contain 
      proviral DNA or double-stranded replicative forms of TT virus (TTV) and to define 
      which cell subset harbors TTV, we analyzed 126 PBMC DNA samples by PCR, using the 
      NG059/NG061/NG063 and the T801/T935 primer sets. TTV sequences were detected in 
      nearly 20% (25/126) of PBMC DNA samples. Analysis of PBMC subsets revealed that TTV 
      was preferentially distributed in CD19(+) cells. TTV DNA was also detected in 
      CD3(+)/CD19(+) double-depleted cells but was undetectable in CD3(+) cells. After 
      degradation of single-stranded DNA using mung bean nuclease (MBN), TTV could not be 
      detected in previously TTV-positive PBMC DNA samples nor in DNA from CD19(+) cells, 
      CD3(+)-depleted, and CD3(+)/CD19(+) double-depleted cells, indicating the lack of 
      TTV DNA integration and the absence of viral double-stranded replicative 
      intermediates in PBMC or PBMC subset cells. Our data indicate that PBMC and PBMC 
      subsets are not the major sites of TTV replication.

TI  - Torquetenovirus DNA drives proinflammatory cytokines production and secretion by 
      immune cells via toll-like receptor 9.
PG  - 235-42
LID - 10.1016/j.virol.2009.08.036 [doi]
AB  - Active infection with torquetenovirus (TTV) has been associated with an increased 
      severity of diseases in which inflammation plays a particularly important 
      pathogenetic role. Here, we report that cloned DNA of a genogroup 4 TTV (ViPiSAL) is 
      an activator of proinflammatory cytokine production by murine spleen cells and that 
      the effect is mediated via toll-like receptor (TLR)9. The same DNA also increased 
      the levels of proinflammatory cytokines induced by two well-characterized TLR9 
      stimulants. Finally, in silico analyses of the genomes of ViPiSAL and other TTVs 
      revealed marked differences in the representation of CpG motifs known to be most 
      effective at activating immune cells via TLR9. These findings demonstrate for the 
      first time that at least one TTV isolate has the potential to stimulate and 
      co-stimulate inflammatory responses.

TI  - Heterogeneous distribution of TT virus of distinct genotypes in multiple tissues 
      from infected humans.
PG  - 358-68
AB  - TT virus (TTV) DNA was quantitated in the serum and nine autopsy tissues (bone 
      marrow, lymph node, muscle, thyroid gland, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, and 
      kidney) obtained from each of three TTV-infected subjects by real-time polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR), which can detect all TTV genotypes. TTV DNA was detected in 
      all examined tissues, with the viral load being equal to or up to 300 times higher 
      than that in the corresponding serum (2.1 x 10(5) to 5.3 x 10(7) copies/g vs 1.2-3.9 
      x 10(5) copies/ml). Generally, the TTV viral load was higher in the bone marrow, 
      lung, spleen, and liver than in the other tissues, although it varied by individual. 
      Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the PCR-amplified TTV 
      DNA of 3.3 kilobases (kb) revealed considerable differences among the TTVs in the 
      serum and tissue specimens from each subject. Further, the 3.3-kb amplicons from the 
      serum and tissue specimens from one subject were molecularly cloned, and 30 clones 
      each from the serum and each tissue specimen were subjected to RFLP and sequence 
      analysis (total, 300 clones): the TTV clones were classified into six genotypes 
      including four novel genotypes. The genotypic variability was remarkable: each 
      specimen had one to five TTV genotypes at different frequencies. TTV DNA in 
      replicative intermediate forms and TTV mRNA were detectable in all tissues tested. 
      These results indicate the broad, uneven distribution of TTV genotypes in tissues 
      and suggest that viral replication takes place in multiple tissues at distinct 
      levels in infected individuals.

TI  - Clinicopathological study on TTV infection in hepatitis of unknown etiology.
PG  - 288-93
AB  - AIM: To investigate the state of infection, replication site, pathogenicity and 
      clinical significance of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in patients with 
      hepatitis, especially in patients of unknown etiology. METHODS: Liver tissues taken 
      from 136 cases of non-A non-G hepatitis were tested for TT virus antigen and nucleic 
      acid by in situ hybridization (ISH) and nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
      Among them, TT virus genome and its complemental strand were also detected in 24 
      cases of autopsy liver and extrahepatic tissues with ISH. Meanwhile, TTV DNA was 
      detected in the sera of 187 hepatitis patients by nested-PCR. The pathological and 
      clinical data of the cases infected with TTV only were analyzed. RESULTS: In liver, 
      the total positive rate of TTV DNA was 32.4% and the positive signals were located 
      in the nuclei of hepatocytes. In serus, TTV DNA was detected in 21.4% cases of 
      hepatitis A-G, 34.4% of non-A non-G hepatitis and 15% of healthy donors. The 
      correspondence rate of TTV DNA detection between liver tissue with ISH and sera with 
      PCR was 63.2% and 89.3% in the same liver tissues by ISH and by PCR, respectively. 
      Using double-strand probes and single-strand probes designed to detect TTV genome, 
      the correspondence rate of TTV DNA detected in liver and extrahepatic tissues was 
      85.7%. Using single-strand probes, TTV genome could be detected in liver and 
      extrahepatic tissues by PCR, but its complemental strands (replication strands) 
      could be observed only in livers. The liver function of most cases infected with TTV 
      alone was abnormal and the liver tissues had different pathological damage such as 
      ballooning, acidophilia degeneration, formation of apoptosis bodies and focus of 
      necrosis, but the inflammation in the lobule and portal area was mild. CONCLUSION: 
      The positive rate of TTV DNA among cases of hepatitis was higher than that of 
      donors, especially in patients with non-A non-G hepatitis, but most of them were 
      coinfected with other hepatitis viruses. TTV can infect not only hepatocytes, but 
      also extrahepatic tissues. However, the chief replication place may be liver. The 
      infection of TTV may have some pathogenicity. Although the pathogenicity is 
      comparatively weak, it can still damage the liver tissues. The lesions in acute 
      hepatitis (AH) and chronic hepatitis (CH) are mild, but in severe hepatitis (SH), it 
      can be very serious and cause liver function failure, therefore, we should pay more 
      attention to TTV when studying the possible pathogens of so-called "liver hepatitis 
      of unknown etiology".

TI  - Low prevalence of TT virus in the cerebrospinal fluid of viremic patients with 
      central nervous system disorders.
PG  - 418-22
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a widespread infectious agent of humans identified in 1998. In 
      infected individuals, TTV induces persistent viremia but its life cycle and 
      pathogenic potential are still poorly understood. In the present study, the presence 
      of TTV DNA in 32 consecutive paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from 
      patients with neurological (mainly multiple sclerosis) disorders was investigated by 
      means of a sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assay. Of the 24 patients who were 
      found to carry TTV DNA in serum, 3 also had detectable TTV DNA in their CSF. Two TTV 
      positive CSF samples had markers indicative of blood contamination or a disrupted 
      blood-brain barrier and contained considerably lower TTV loads as compared with the 
      corresponding serum samples, thus suggesting that the virus they contained was of 
      plasma origin. These findings indicated that in general TTV does not permeate 
      effectively an intact blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the CNS does not represent a 
      common site of TTV replication and persistence. However, at least one exception was 
      observed: the third TTV positive CSF sample (obtained from a patient with subacute 
      dementia of unknown origin) showed no markers suggestive of disrupted blood-brain 
      barrier or blood contamination and had a TTV DNA concentration similar to that found 
      in the patient's serum. In addition, the TTV isolates detected in the two body 
      fluids were distinct genetically. The detection of TTV DNA in CSF is of considerable 
      interest but the clinical significance remains unknown.

TI  - Detection and typing of TT virus DNA genotype by the PCR-RFLP method.
PG  - 195-200
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a novel single-stranded DNA virus that was identified in patients 
      with post-transfusion-hepatitis of non-A-G type in Japan in 1997. We developed a new 
      detection and typing method for TTV DNA strains, by combining polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. 
      TTV DNA was amplified by nested-PCR with TTV-specific mixed primers derived from the 
      conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region of the published TTV DNA sequences. 
      Using the enzymes Hae III, Dra I, Eco RI and Pst I, we were able to distinguish 
      between the four TTV genotypes. In 200 serum samples obtained from healthy pregnant 
      women at an outpatient clinic, the positive rate of TTV detection was 27.0%, almost 
      identical to the positive rate of the detection of ORF1-PCR in Japanese healthy 
      individuals. The strains detected in the positive serum samples were genotype 1a 
      (9.3%), genotype 1b (11.1%), genotype 2 (51.9%), genotype 3 (7.4%) and other 
      genotypes (1.9%). This results indicate that genotype 1 and genotype 2 were the two 
      major strains in the Japanese population. Moreover, 10 serum samples (18.5%) 
      presented RFLP patterns in which some genotypes were mixed.

TI  - Dynamics of persistent TT virus infection, as determined in patients treated with 
      alpha interferon for concomitant hepatitis C virus infection.
PG  - 11999-2004
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently identified widespread DNA virus of humans that produces 
      persistent viremia in the absence of overt clinical manifestations. In an attempt to 
      shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in 
      the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha 
      interferon (IFN-alpha) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. 
      The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for 
      HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but 
      some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at 
      least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No 
      correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the 
      viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed 
      mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with 
      over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of 
      approximately 3.8 x 10(10) virions generated per day. Low levels of TTV were 
      occasionally detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients who had 
      cleared plasma viremia, thus corroborating previous results showing that these cells 
      may support TTV replication and/or persistence.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify the influence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) 
      co-infection in other virus infected patients and its genotypes. METHODS: A 
      conservative sequence of ORF1 in the TTV genome was selected as primers and TTV DNA 
      was measured in students and other hepatitis patients by using microplate nucleic 
      acid hybridization and ELISA. The results were statistically analyzed. Nucleotide 
      sequence of divergence>50% was used as color probe for distinguishing TTV genotypes 
      I or II. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in the sera from 2 (3.3%) of 60 students, 2 
      (14.3%) of 14 patients with non A-non E hepatitis, 6 (12%) of 50 patients with 
      chronic hepatitis B, and 4 (16%) of 25 patients with liver cirrhosis, respectively. 
      Statistical difference was observed between the patient group and the student group 
      (P<0.05), but no significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT levels and TBiL 
      between TTV DNA positive and negative patients (P>0.05). TTV genotype type I was by 
      far the most frequent viral genotype (66.7%), followed by type II (25%), and mixed 
      infection (8.3%). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the routes of TTV 
      infection may be similar to those of HBV and HCV, and concurrent infection with HBV, 
      HCV are common. TTV co-infection could not affect the clinical features of patients 
      with liver diseases and the pathological process. TTV is not a main causative factor 
      for patients with non A-non E hepatitis. Further study is needed to clarify the role 
      of TTV in patients with non A-non E hepatitis.

TI  - Mixed infections of adults and children with multiple TTV-like mini virus isolates.
PG  - 291-8
AB  - Testing of the DNA of TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) was done with serum samples 
      obtained from 184 patients (children and adults) who visited different outpatient 
      clinics at a university hospital in Florianopolis, south of Brazil. TLMV DNA was 
      detected by PCR primers from the non-coding region of the genome. A global TLMV 
      prevalence of 78% was found (94% among children below 11 years). PCR products from 
      three serum samples (patients A-C) were cloned, and the sequences with a length of 
      201-227 nucleotides were determined for 16-19 clones derived from each of the sera. 
      Among the 16 clones derived from patient C, 15 were identical, and the remaining one 
      had a sequence homology of 99%. In contrast, eight different sequences were obtained 
      among the 19 clones derived from patient A, and 10 distinct sequences were depicted 
      among the 17 clones derived from the serum of patient B. Additionally, 13 clones 
      derived from a saliva sample of patient B were sequenced, and seven different 
      nucleotide sequences obtained. One particular sequence was predominant in both serum 
      (8/17 clones) and saliva (7/13 clones) of patient B. On a phylogenetic tree, 
      sequences derived from patient A (a 6-year-old boy), as well as those derived from 
      patient B (a 24-year-old man), were located in five distinct evolutionary branches, 
      taking a minimum divergence of 5% between branches. This suggested that adults and 
      children are coinfected frequently with several TLMV isolates of different origins.

TI  - Prevalence and viral persistence of TT virus in patients on hemodialysis.
PG  - 878-80
AB  - The aim of this study was toevaluate the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) in 107 
      hemodialysis patients and 100 healthy individuals. Sixteen percent of hemodialysis 
      patients and 2% of the control population were TTV positive (P<0.001). Sex, time on 
      dialysis, transfusions, and alanine aminotransferase levels were not related to the 
      presence of TTV DNA. TTV was more frequent in patients 50 to 70 (12/51) years of age 
      and persisted in the serum of six of nine patients 8 months later. TTV was found in 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all patients with chronic infection, and 
      sequence variation was noted in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two 
      patients. No relationship between TTV infection and hepatitis was observed. Viral 
      persistence and nonparenteral transmission may be possible in patients on 
      hemodialysis.

TI  - Cloning and sequencing of TT virus genotype 6 and expression of antigenic open 
      reading frame 2 proteins.
PG  - 979-990
LID - 10.1099/0022-1317-83-5-979 [doi]
AB  - The near-full-length genome of a TT virus (TTV) (HEL32), closely related to the 
      previously uncharacterized genotype 6, was cloned and sequenced. The genomic 
      organization of HEL32 was compared to 41 published near-full-length TTV sequences 
      representing 17 genotypes. In the majority of genomes, the open reading frame (ORF) 
      2 region was divided into two separate ORFs, 2a and 2b. The ORF2a sequence was 
      conserved among all genotypes, while the ORF2b region showed more variability. The 
      two corresponding putative proteins of HEL32 were expressed in prokaryotes and their 
      antigenic potential was studied. IgM and IgG antibodies to the respective 
      ORF2-encoded proteins, fp2a and fp2b, and the presence of TTV DNA were studied in 
      the sera of 89 constitutionally healthy adults. By immunoblot using the small TTV 
      proteins as antigens, strong IgM and IgG reactivities were found in 9 and 10% of 
      subjects, respectively. Follow-up studies for 12-15 years of three subjects showed 
      either a persistent coexistence of IgM and TTV DNA or the appearance of viral DNA 
      regardless of pre-existing antibodies. The low prevalence of IgG could be due to the 
      weak immunogenicity of these probably non-structural proteins or to a 
      genotype-specific antibody response. By nested PCR of the conserved ORF2a region, 
      the prevalence of TTV DNA was 85%. TTV genotype 6 sequences were found by specific 
      PCR in 3 of 35 (8.6%) subjects. The low prevalence of TTV IgG compared to the high 
      TTV DNA prevalence, the coexistence of antibodies and viral DNA and the appearance 
      of TTV DNA regardless of pre-existing antibodies suggest that the B-cell immunity 
      against these minor TTV proteins would not be cross protective.

TI  - Isolation of multiple TT virus genotypes from spleen biopsy tissue from a Hodgkin's 
      disease patient: genome reorganization and diversity in the hypervariable region.
PG  - 7498-507
AB  - We report the isolation of 24 novel genotypes of TT viruses from a surgically 
      removed spleen of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. The sequence analysis of our 24 
      isolates revealed the remarkable heterogeneity of TT virus isolates not only from 
      the same patient but also from the same biopsy material. These isolates belong to 
      four phylogenetic groups of TT viruses. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed five 
      distinct genotypes (tth3, tth4, tth5, tth6, and tth7). The limited variation in 
      sequence identity of the other isolates defines the latter as variants of four of 
      these genotypes. A group of 6 isolates (the tth7 group) revealed a reorganization of 
      open reading frame 1 (ORF1) leading to one larger and a varying number of smaller 
      ORFs. The nucleotide difference of the full-length genomes was less than 1%. A 
      variation of 69 to 97% in amino acids of a second group of 8 isolates (the tth3 
      group) was restricted to the hypervariable region of ORF1, indicating the existence 
      of a quasi-species. These isolates differed by less than 2% in the remainder of 
      their nucleotide sequences. An alignment of these isolates with 79 previously 
      reported TT virus genotypes permits the proposal of TT virus genera and species 
      within the family Anelloviridae in analogy to a previous proposal for the 
      papillomaviruses (family Papillomaviridae).

TI  - Distribution of TT virus (TTV), TTV-like minivirus, and related viruses in humans 
      and nonhuman primates.
PG  - 324-33
AB  - TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like minivirus (TLMV) are small DNA viruses with 
      single-stranded, closed circular, antisense genomes infecting man. Despite their 
      extreme sequence heterogeneity (>50%), a highly conserved region in the untranslated 
      region (UTR) allows both viruses to be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
      TTV/TLMV infection was detected in 88 of 100 human plasma samples; amplified 
      sequences were differentiated into TTV and TLMV by analysis of melting profiles, 
      showing that both viruses were similarly prevalent. PCR with UTR primers also 
      detected frequent infection with TTV/TLMV-related viruses in a wide range of apes 
      (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons) and African monkey species (mangabeys, 
      drills, mandrills). These findings support the hypothesis for the co-evolution of 
      TTV-like viruses with their hosts over the period of primate speciation, potentially 
      analogous to the evolution of primate herpesviruses.

TI  - TTV infection in children born to mothers infected with TTV but not with HBV, HCV, 
      or HIV.
PG  - 499-506
AB  - The TT virus (TTV) was isolated recently from the serum of a patient with 
      post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV infection is widespread in the general population, 
      and its prevalence increases continuously with age. The pathogenic role of TTV in 
      liver disease remains controversial, and the source of transmission is still 
      unclear. We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in 
      infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 
      mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and 
      the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months 
      after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned 
      and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of 
      the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. 
      Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase 
      (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not 
      associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia 
      developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic 
      analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same 
      genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 
      (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant 
      clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or 
      more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not 
      provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. 
      Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their 
      mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, 
      intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection.

TI  - Phosphorylation of serine-rich protein encoded by open reading frame 3 of the TT 
      virus genome.
PG  - 298-304
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered human virus with a single-stranded, circular 
      DNA genome. The TTV DNA sequence includes two major open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 
      and ORF2. Recently, spliced TTV mRNAs were detected and revealed two additional 
      coding regions, ORF3 and ORF4. We found sequence similarity between the TTV ORF3 
      protein and hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein, which is a 
      phosphoprotein and is thought to associate with various cellular proteins. To test 
      whether the TTV ORF3 protein is phosphorylated, the state of phosphorylation was 
      analyzed with a transient protein production system. The TTV ORF3 protein was 
      phosphorylated at the serine residues in its C-terminal portion. Furthermore, the 
      TTV ORF3 gene generated two forms of proteins with a different phosphorylation 
      state, similar to the HCV NS5A region, suggesting that TTV ORF3 protein has 
      function(s) similar to phosphorylated viral proteins such as the HCV NS5A protein.

TI  - TT virus infection among Egyptian patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 9-16
AB  - Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) have been associated with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma (HCC). Recently, a novel DNA virus was isolated from a patient with 
      posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology and designated TT virus (TTV). To 
      examine whether this virus is associated with HCC, we investigated sera from 82 
      Egyptian patients with histopathologically-diagnosed HCC. All subjects underwent 
      serological investigations for detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), 
      hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) and anti-HCV. Detection of TTV-DNA was performed 
      by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TTV-specific primers. TTV-DNA 
      was detected in 28% of the patients. Age, gender, risk factors and biochemical liver 
      functions did not significantly differ between TTV-DNA positive and negative 
      patients. TTV was detected in 27.1% of patients with HCV-HCC, 25% of HBV-HCC, 66.7% 
      of dual HCV and HBV infection and 40% of those with non-B, non-C-HCC (NBNC-HCC). It 
      is concluded that, in this the cohort of Egyptian patients with HCC, TTV infection 
      is common and is not associated with HCV, HBV, NBNC-HCC, history of schistosomiasis 
      or blood transfusion.

TI  - Detecting recombination in TT virus: a phylogenetic approach.
PG  - 563-72
AB  - TT virus (TTV) has a remarkable genetic heterogeneity. To study TTV evolution, 
      phylogenetic analyses were performed on 739 DNA sequences mapping in the N22 region 
      of ORF1. Analysis of neighbor-joining consensus trees shows significant differences 
      between DNA and protein phylogeny. Median joining networks phylogenetic clustering 
      indicates that DNA sequence analysis is biased by homoplasy (i.e., genetic 
      variability not originated by descent), indicative of either hypermutation or 
      recombination. Statistical analysis shows that the significant excess of homoplasy 
      is due to frequent recombination among closely related strains. Recombination events 
      imply that the transmission of TTV is not clonal and provide the necessary basis to 
      explain (i) the high degree of genetic divergence between TTV isolates, (ii) the 
      lack of population structure on a world scale, and (iii) the number of highly 
      divergent strains that seems typical of this virus. We show that recombination 
      phenomena can be detected by phylogenetic analyses in very short sequences when a 
      sufficiently large data set is available.

TI  - TT virus infection: prevalence of elevated viraemia and arguments for the immune 
      control of viral load.
PG  - 135-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: The most recent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection protocols for 
      the TT virus (TTV) permit one to identify the presence of viral DNA in the serum of 
      a majority of healthy individuals, in the absence of any particular risk factor. 
      This is in contrast with previous epidemiological studies that reported a higher 
      prevalence of TTV infection in populations such as haemodialysis patients (HD), 
      haemophiliacs, intravenous drug users or diabetics. OBJECTIVES: To show that these 
      discrepant results were due to the different sensitivity (number of viral copies 
      detected) of the detection protocols used in initial and more recent epidemiological 
      studies. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: We designed a standardised primary PCR assay that 
      detects only viraemia >5x10(3) to 5x10(4) copies/ml for genotypes 1, 2 and 3, and 
      compared the results of this test with those of a nested PCR assay which is 100-fold 
      more sensitive. Viraemia >5x10(3) to 5x10(4) copies/ml were statistically more 
      frequent in HD patients (54.3%), diabetics (54.7%), and HIV-infected patients with 
      CD4 cells <200/mm(3) (69%) than in blood donors (37%) or HIV-infected patients with 
      CD4 cells >500/mm(3) (33%). CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest a possible relationship 
      between the prevalence of elevated viral loads and the level of immunocompetence of 
      the populations studied, and therefore that of an immune control of TTV viraemia. 
      This corroborates previous findings showing that the stimulation of the immune 
      system by an interferon treatment was able to clear TTV viraemia.

TI  - Detection of TT virus in lymph node biopsies of B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's 
      disease, and its association with EBV infection.
PG  - 109-18
AB  - Human TT virus (TTV) recently isolated from the serum of a patient with 
      post-transfusion hepatitis does seem to have only hepatopathic effect. The virus can 
      also infect the serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow 
      cells (BMC ). Additional evidence has indicated that TTV is also present in the 
      serum of people with hematopoietic malignancies. A significant increase in the 
      incidence of lymphoma has recently been observed worldwide. We have investigated the 
      presence of TTV DNA in lymph node biopsies of Italian patients affected with the 
      most common lymphoma types in Western Countries: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse 
      large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease (NS-HD). The 
      possible role of a co-infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has also been 
      investigated. DNA was extracted from 73 paraffin-embedded and 38 snap-frozen tissue 
      specimens. From these, only 67 samples (29 paraffin-embedded and 38 snap-frozen 
      tissues) from a total of 56 patients, were suitable for PCR analysis. TTV and EBV 
      were detected by PCR using primers from two different conserved region in TTV and 
      EBV genomes respectively. TTV DNA was detected in 30.0-50.0% of FL, 30.8% of DLBCL 
      and 30.0-50.0% of NS-HD cases, depending on the primers used. All cases of 
      non-specific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH), used as a putative control, were 
      negative. The two major TTV genotypes circulating in Italy (G1 and G2) were detected 
      in the analysed lymphoid neoplasms. EBV DNA was detected in 40.0% of FL, in 72.7%of 
      DLBCL, in 80.0% of SN-HD and in 40.0% of RLH cases. EBV co-infection was found in 
      90% of TTV positive cases. The in situ hybridization assay was performed in TTV 
      positive frozen samples. The significant prevalence of TTV DNA in lymphocytes 
      circulating in the lymph nodes of both B-cell lymphomas and HD reported herewith 
      suggests an implication of TTV infection in the development of these 
      lymphoproliferative disorders.

TI  - TT virus infection: role of interferons, interleukin-28 and 29, cytokines and 
      antiviral proteins.
PG  - 249-58
AB  - In 1997 a novel virus in the serum of a patient with acute post-transfusion 
      hepatitis of non A-G etiology was identified. This agent was designed TT virus 
      (TTV). It produces persistent viremia and no disease, but the mechanism of its 
      persistence is poorly understood. In the present study mRNA expression of antiviral 
      proteins as MxA, 2' 5' OAS, anti-apopotic protein, cytokines IL- 28, IL- 29 and IFN 
      are examined in a subject affected by B lymphoma and positive for TTV DNA and RNA in 
      this cellular subset, and in BJAB and Dohh2 cell lines.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of TT virus (TTV) and characterization of two novel TTV 
      genotypes in Indonesia.
PG  - 1249-66
AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) DNA among 244 healthy individuals in 23 cities on 
      12 islands in Indonesia was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 
      primers derived from the coding region (N22), which can detect TTV DNA of genotypes 
      1-6. By N22 PCR, TTV DNA was detected in 102 (42%) individuals. The amplified PCR 
      products were molecularly cloned and three clones each were subjected to sequence 
      analysis. Three hundred one (98%) of the 306 TTV clones were classified into 
      genotype 1, 2 or 3, and none into genotypes 4-6. The remaining five clones from two 
      individuals (Kt-08 and Kt-10) on Kutai, Kalimantan Island, differed by >30% from 
      known TTV isolates of all 21 genotypes and were tentatively classified into 
      genotypes 22 and 23, respectively. Using primers specific for the new TTV genotype 
      22 or 23, TTV genotype 22 was detected significantly more frequently in Kutai than 
      in the other 22 cities (41% vs. 5%, P < 0.001). TTV genotype 23 was restricted to 
      Kutai (17% vs. 0%, P < 0.001), suggesting the indigenous nature of this genotype. 
      Analysis of two TTV isolates (Kt-08F and Kt-10F) demonstrated the extreme diversity 
      of TTV and the preservation of the genomic organization and transcription profile.

TI  - Mother-to-infant transmission of TT virus in Japan.
PG  - 11-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The TT virus (TTV) was detected for the first time by Nishizawa and 
      Okamoto et al. in 1997 in the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of 
      unknown origin (non-A-non-G type). TTV was subsequently, also found in the serum of 
      blood donors with no history of blood transfusion, although at a lower rate than 
      among donors with a history of blood transfusion. In the present study, we 
      determined the percentage of TTV carriers among pregnant women with no history of 
      blood transfusion, and evaluated the possibility of mother-child transmission. 
      METHODS: Blood was sampled from 300 normal pregnant women with no history of blood 
      transfusion, 10 infants born by vaginal delivery from TTV-positive women, 10 infants 
      born by abdominal cesarean section from TTV-positive women at both 5 days and 3 
      months after birth, and 10 infants born from TTV-positive women at 6 months after 
      birth. Amniotic fluid and breast milk were sampled from 10 and 30 TTV-positive 
      women, respectively. Informed consent was obtained from all women before sampling. 
      TTV DNA was detected by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. RESULTS: 
      (1) Of the 300 normal pregnant women with no history of blood transfusion, 60 (20%) 
      were TTV-positive. (2) All infants from TTV-positive mothers were TTV-negative at 
      both 5 days and 3 months after birth, regardless of whether they were born by 
      vaginal delivery or abdominal cesarean section. (3) Of the 10 infants who were born 
      from TTV-positive mothers and examined 6 months after birth, 4 (40%) were 
      TTV-positive. (4) Amniotic fluid from all 10 TTV-positive women was TTV-negative. 
      (5) Breast milk from 7 (23.3%) of the 30 TTV-positive women was TTV-positive. 
      CONCLUSION: TTV was detected in 20% of pregnant women with no history of blood 
      transfusion, suggesting that TTV infection can occur through non- blood-mediated 
      routes. The possibility of transfer of TTV into amniotic fluid was ruled out due to 
      its absence in amniotic fluid samples. All infants from TTV-positive women were 
      TTV-negative at both 5 days and 3 months after birth, regardless of whether they 
      were born by vaginal delivery or abdominal cesarean section, suggesting that 
      infection in the parturient canal or the pelvis is unlikely. Because TTV was 
      detected in breast milk from TTV-positive women and some of their infants were 
      TTV-positive, breast milk was thought to be a mother-child infection route. These 
      findings suggest that horizontal infection is more likely than vertical infection in 
      mother-child transmission of TTV.

TI  - Detection and genotyping of TT virus in healthy and subjects with HBV or HCV in 
      different populations in the United Arab Emirates.
PG  - 502-8
AB  - TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like viruses (TTVLs) have been reported to be associated with 
      non-A-E hepatitis. To determine the rate of infection and genotypic characteristics 
      of TTV in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a total of 449 serum samples representing 
      different populations in the UAE and comprising healthy as well as patients positive 
      for HBsAg and HCV were screened. National subjects (n = 200) and non-nationals 
      residing in the UAE (n = 249) were tested by PCR. The results obtained showed that 
      the rate of TTV infection in healthy nationals, and those with HBsAg or antibody to 
      HCV were 34.9, 97.9, and 95.7, respectively, compared to 89.1% (115/129), 89.2% 
      (66/74), and 84.8% (39/46), respectively, in non-nationals. Sequence analysis of the 
      untranslated region (UTR) using 71 clones generated from the PCR products of eight 
      serum samples from healthy individuals (four nationals and four non-nationals) 
      showed that 83.1% of the TTV clones were classified into groups 1-4, whereas 16.9% 
      into possibly new genotype(s). The analysis also revealed that healthy national 
      subjects carried multiple viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of representative sequences 
      revealed clustering of clones into at least five major groups. Also, when compared 
      to reference genotypes (from GenBank), two of our clones belonged to two previously 
      identified genotypes. Non-significant gender differences were seen in all ethnic 
      groups studied (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the rate of TTV infection in the UAE 
      nationals is significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the non-nationals and 
      several genotypes were isolated with common multi-infections.

TI  - Distribution and genetic analysis of TTV and TTMV major phylogenetic groups in 
      French blood donors.
PG  - 298-304
AB  - TTV and TTMV (recently assigned to the floating genus Anellovirus) infect human 
      populations (including healthy individuals) at high prevalence (>80%). They display 
      notably high levels of genetic diversity, but very little is known regarding the 
      distribution of Anellovirus genetic groups in human populations. We analyzed the 
      distribution of the major genetic groups of TTV and TTMV in healthy voluntary blood 
      donors using group-independent and group-specific PCR amplifications systems, 
      combined with sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis. Analysis of 
      Anellovirus groups revealed a non-random pattern of group distribution with a 
      predominant prevalence of TTV phylogenetic groups 1, 3, and 5, and of TTMV group 1. 
      Multiple co-infections were observed. In addition, TTMV sequences exhibiting a high 
      genetic divergence with reference sequences were identified. This study provided the 
      first picture of the genetic distribution of the major phylogenetic groups of 
      members of the genus Anellovirus in a cohort of French voluntary blood donors. 
      Obtaining such data from a reference population comprising healthy individuals was 
      an essential step that will allow the subsequent comparative analysis of cohorts 
      including patients with well-characterized diseases, in order to identify any 
      possible relationship between Anellovirus infection and human diseases.

TI  - TT virus (TTV) genotyping in blood donors and multiple transfused patients in 
      Brazil.
PG  - 503-9
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widely distributed in the general population. The objective of the 
      present study was to investigate the prevalence and distribution of TTV genotypes 
      among blood donor candidates and multiple transfused patients in the Southeast 
      region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. TTV-DNA detection by amplification of a 
      segment of the ORF-1 region, presented a prevalence of 11.9% in 270 serum samples 
      from blood donors, of 46.2% in 18 samples from patients with coagulopathies, and of 
      31.8% in 15 samples from patients with hemoglobinopathies. When specific primers for 
      the non-coding (UTR) region of the TTV genome were used the prevalences were 50.5%, 
      95.0%, and 82.0% for blood donors, patients with coagulopathies and patients with 
      hemoglobinopathies, respectively. Positive samples from 49 individuals were 
      sequenced and partial segments of 230 base pairs referring to the ORF-1 region of 
      the TTV genome were used for the determination of their genotypes with the aid of 
      phylogenetic analysis. The most frequent genotype was 1 (74.0%), followed by 
      genotype 2 (26.0%). These data indicate a high prevalence of this virus in the 
      populations of blood donors and transfused patients, providing further evidence for 
      the role of transfusions as an efficient pathway in the transmission chain.

TI  - [Distribution of TT virus genotypes and genogroups in 69 healthy and 59 hepatitis B 
      virus infected Korean individuals].
PG  - 257-64
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) infection is highly prevalent in general population and 
      patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of the present study was to 
      determine the distribution of the genotypes and genogroups of TTV in healthy and 
      HBV-infected individuals in Korea. METHODS: Distribution of TTV genotypes and 
      genogroups was investigated in the serum samples of 69 healthy and 59 HBV-infected 
      individuals. PCR products of N22 region were genotyped by sequence analysis. TTV 
      genogroups were determined by 5 different genogroup-specific PCR assays. RESULTS: 
      Among the 20 sequenced isolates, 9 (45%) were genotype 2, 8 (40%) were genotype 1, 2 
      (10%) were genotype 3, and 1 (5%) was genotype 4. TTV genogroup 4 was found most 
      frequently (52/128), followed by genogroup 3 (42/128), genogroup 1 (35/128), 
      genogroup 5 (32/128), and genogroup 2 (1/128). Mixed infections with different 
      genogroups were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: TTV genotype 2 and 1 are predominant 
      genotypes. TTV genotype 3 was detected for the first time in Korea. TTV genogroups 4 
      and 3 were predominant genogroups. No significant difference was observed in the 
      distribution of TTV genogroups between healthy and HBV-infected individuals.

TI  - Fecal excretion of a novel human circovirus, TT virus, in healthy children.
PG  - 960-3
AB  - The role of TT virus (TTV) as a human pathogen is unclear, as is the mode of TTV 
      transmission. To determine the prevalence of TTV infection and the possible 
      fecal-oral route of transmission, we analyzed fecal specimens from 67 healthy, 
      nontransfused children for TTV DNA sequences by heminested PCR, using the NG and T 
      primer sets. The overall prevalence of TTV fecal excretion was 22.4% (15 of 67), 
      with the T primer set (19.4%) being more sensitive than the NG primer set (10.4%). 
      TTV prevalence based on gender or ethnicity showed no significant differences. None 
      of seven children in the 0- to 6-month age group had detectable TTV in feces. Of 
      three sets of siblings, two unrelated sets of twins, ages 33 and 37 months, were 
      negative for fecal TTV DNA, while the third set of siblings, ages 99 and 35 months, 
      was positive. The absence of TTV in the feces of children younger than 6 months and 
      the high prevalence (40%) in children 7 to 12 months of age is consistent with 
      age-specific acquisition of TTV infection by the nonparenteral route. TTV genotypes 
      1, 3, 4, and 5 were represented in our study population. TTV-positive siblings had 
      TTV genotypes 1 and 4, suggesting unrelated environmental sources of TTV infection. 
      This observation suggests a possible time frame for TTV acquisition in children 
      which coincides with increased interaction with their environment and increased 
      susceptibility to infectious agents.

TI  - [Infection of mice with TT virus].
PG  - 36-8
AB  - The sera pool of the human blood containing TTV DNA were administered to mice 
      intravenously and then every 10 days examinations were made of blood serum and 
      different organs of inoculated mice by polymerase chain reaction for presence of the 
      viral nucleotide sequences. The viral DNA was revealed in the blood serum, the 
      liver, kidneys and other organs 20 days after infection and persisted in most of the 
      animals during 80 days. The data obtained show the possibility of TTV-infection of 
      mice.

TI  - TT virus and hepatitis G virus infections in Korean blood donors and patients with 
      chronic liver disease.
PG  - 741-4
AB  - AIM: To determine the prevalences of TTV and HGV infections among blood donors and 
      patients with chronic liver disease in Korea, to investigate the association of TTV 
      and HGV infections with blood transfusion, and to assess the correlation between TTV 
      and HGV viremia and hepatic damage. METHODS: A total of 391 serum samples were 
      examined in this study. Samples were obtained from healthy blood donors (n=110), 
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive donors (n=112), anti-hepatitis C virus 
      (anti-HCV)-positive donors (n=69), patients with type B chronic liver disease 
      (n=81), and patients with type C chronic liver disease (n=19). TTV DNA was detected 
      using the hemi-nested PCR. HGV RNA was tested using RT-PCR. A history of blood 
      transfusion and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) were also determined. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 8.2 % 
      of healthy blood donors, 16.1 % of HBsAg-positive donors, 20.3 % of 
      anti-HCV-positive donors, 21.0 % of patients with type B chronic liver disease, and 
      21.1 % of patients with type C chronic liver disease. HGV RNA was detected in 1.8 % 
      of healthy blood donors, 1.8 % of HBsAg-positive donors, 17.4 % of anti-HCV-positive 
      donors, 13.6 % of patients with type B chronic liver disease, and 10.5 % of patients 
      with type C chronic liver disease. The prevalence of TTV and HGV infections in HBV- 
      or HCV-positive donors and patients was significantly higher than in healthy blood 
      donors (P<0.05), except for the detection rate of HGV in HBsAg-positive donors which 
      was the same as for healthy donors. There was a history of transfusion in 66.7 % of 
      TTV DNA-positive patients and 76.9 % of HGV RNA-positive patients (P<0.05). No 
      significant increase in serum ALT and AST was detected in the TTV- or HGV-positive 
      donors and patients. CONCLUSION: TTV and HGV infections are more frequently found in 
      donors and patients infected with HBV or HCV than in healthy blood donors. However, 
      there is no significant association between TTV or HGV infections and liver injury.

TI  - Analysis of the entire genomes of thirteen TT virus variants classifiable into the 
      fourth and fifth genetic groups, isolated from viremic infants.
PG  - 21-41
AB  - TT virus (TTV) DNA in serum samples obtained from 24 TTV-infected infants was 
      amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with inverse primers derived from the 
      untranslated region. The amplified PCR products were molecularly cloned; six clones 
      each were analyzed. Seventy-six (53%) of the 144 TTV clones were classified into 
      group 4 (YONBAN isolates), and 22 (15%) into a novel genetic group (group 5). The 
      TTV clones in group 4 were classified into 9 types, and those in group 5 into 4 
      types. The entire nucleotide sequence of one representative clone each from the 13 
      types were determined; they comprised 3570-3770 nucleotides, and had poor homology 
      to TTVs of groups 1-3 (TA278, PMV and SANBAN isolates). A phylogenetic tree based on 
      the entire nucleotide sequence of open reading frame 1 confirmed the presence of 
      five distinct clusters separated by a bootstrap value of 100%. Analysis of 13 TTV 
      variants demonstrated preservation of the genomic organization and transcription 
      profile in all TTV groups. TTV group 4 was detected in 54% or 72% of 
      7-to-12-month-old infants in Japan and China, respectively, which is comparable with 
      that among adults in the respective country, indicating early and frequent 
      acquisition of this TTV group in infancy.

PG  - 631-8
AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first detected in the blood of three patients with elevated serum 
      alanine aminotransferase following transfusion who were negative for all known 
      hepatitis viruses. This virus exhibited hepatotropism, and its titers correlated 
      with elevation in serum aminotransferase concentration suggesting that it was a true 
      hepatitis virus. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the presence of TTV DNA is not 
      associated with biochemical or histologic evidence of liver injury. The virus has 
      been found worldwide with a high prevalence in the general population and there is 
      evidence that it may be transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood, enterally and 
      transmitted from mother to child. An association between TTV infection and acute or 
      chronic hepatitis or other diseases has not been consistently observed.

TI  - Prevalence and genotype distribution of TT virus in various specimen types from 
      thalassaemic patients.
PG  - 304-9
AB  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plasma, saliva and urine samples were 
      collected from 50 thalassaemic patients for TT virus (TTV) detection by two sets of 
      PCR. The set B nested PCR was more sensitive than the widely used NG hemi-nested PCR 
      with TTV positive rates approximately PBMC: 98% vs. 70%; plasma: 92% vs. 66%; 
      saliva: 62% vs. 22%; urine: 22% vs. 6%. All 50 patients had TTV detected in one or 
      more specimens, with 16% of patients being positive in all four specimen types: 40% 
      positive in PBMC, plasma and saliva; 30% positive in PBMC and plasma. In 82 NG 
      hemi-nested PCR-positive samples TTV genotype was identified, 68.3% had a single 
      genotype, 25.6% had multiple genotypes and 6.1% were uncharacterized. The positive 
      rates for genotypes by specimen were: G1 (36/82), G2 (49/82), G3 (2/82), G4 (7/82), 
      G5 (1/82) and G6 (3/82). Among the 42 patients for whom the genotype was examined, 
      42.9% had single-type infection, 45.2% had co-infections and 11.9% had 
      uncharacterized genotypes. Sixteen of them had TTV detected both in PBMC and plasma 
      with seven having identical genotypes in both samples. Eight patients had TTV 
      detected in PBMC, plasma and saliva; two of them harboured identical genotypes in 
      all three samples. The results indicate that, apart from hepatocytes, PBMC is a 
      major cell type for TTV infection occurs. Shedding of TTV in urine and saliva is 
      common and may have a significant role in nonblood-borne transmission among the 
      general population. TTV-infected patients often harbour multiple genotypes 
      suggesting infection with one genotype does not necessarily confer protection 
      against the others. No correlation between TTV infection and liver dysfunction was 
      observed.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widespread among the global population. Its pathogenic nature is 
      still unclear but TTV seems to be more prevalent in cases of hepatitis than in 
      healthy individuals. TTV harbours similarities to chicken anaemia virus (CAV). Here, 
      the apoptotic potential of a putative TTV-derived 105 aa protein and of the main 
      apoptosis-inducing agent of CAV, Apoptin, is compared. As the putative protein 
      induced apoptosis in various human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, it was 
      named TTV-derived apoptosis-inducing protein (TAIP). The apoptotic activity of TAIP 
      in HCC lines was comparable with that of Apoptin. Conversely, unlike Apoptin, TAIP 
      induced only low-level apoptosis in several non-HCC human cancer cell lines. The 
      data suggest that TAIP acts in a different way to Apoptin as it is selective to a 
      certain degree for HCC lines. This activity of TAIP, coupled with the heterogeneity 
      of TTV isolates, may help to explain the variable reports of TTV pathogenicity.

TI  - Three cases with TT virus infection and idiopathic neonatal hepatitis.
PG  - 364-9
AB  - We present three cases of infants with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis showing diffuse 
      intrahepatic fatty degeneration. Prolonged cholestasis has improved immediately upon 
      intravenous administration of a high-dose gammaglobulin treatment in all three 
      patients. The TT virus (TTV) genome was detectable in the serum of two patients, in 
      the duodenal fluid of one and in the liver of all three. By analyzing sequence 
      homology, we observed that the respective TTV isolated from serum, duodenal fluid 
      and liver tissue were completely identical in cases 2 and 3. These findings suggest 
      that TTV infection was one of the contributing factors for neonatal cholestasis in 
      these patients. TTV was isolated from the serum of two out of the three mothers. The 
      viruses were either completely or almost identical in sequence to those isolated 
      from their respective infants, suggesting that they had been transmitted from mother 
      to infant in these 2 cases. The patients presented here, whose livers were infected 
      with the TTV and showed a favorable response to gammaglobulin therapy, may represent 
      a subset of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis patients.

AB  - A 10-year-old Japanese boy developed acute hepatitis with high levels of serum 
      Torque teno virus DNA and marked lymphocytopenia, especially CD4 T-lymphocytopenia. 
      Although the total lymphocyte counts rose as the patient recovered from hepatitis, 
      this was largely because of a marked rise in CD8 cells. In contrast, CD4 cells 
      recovered poorly, resulting in a further striking fall in the CD4/8 ratio. Two 
      months later, the patient developed hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. He was 
      successfully treated with immunosuppressive therapy, which normalized the lymphocyte 
      subset proportions. T-cell subsets analysis at the onset of hepatitis might be 
      useful for predicting development of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia.

TI  - In situ polymerase chain reaction detection of transfusion-transmitted virus in 
      liver biopsy.
PG  - 123-7
AB  - The potential role of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in determining 
      liver damage is poorly understood and no information exists about TTV replication 
      within hepatocytes. In this study, we assess TTV in situ PCR in liver tissue. 
      Twenty-one patients with different degrees of liver damage were studied by both 
      serum TTV-DNA detection and in situ TTV PCR analysis and extractive PCR in liver 
      biopsy paraffin sections (FFPE). Extractive PCR and in situ PCR detected TTV-DNA 
      both in serum and liver tissue of five patients. The presence of TTV in serum 
      matched with that found in the liver and TTV sequences were never found 
      independently in liver or serum. Four out of five TTV-DNA-positive patients have not 
      other known cause of liver damage while in one a coinfection from HCV was observed. 
      Our data indicate that in situ PCR appears to be a reliable tool for the detection 
      of TTV-DNA in FFPE, and may help detecting unknown origin of liver damage.

TI  - [TT virus].
PG  - 117-20
AB  - Non-enveloped TT virus (TTV), recognized in 1997, contains single-stranded circular 
      DNA (about 3,800 nucleotides) and seems to be a member of Circinoviridae, a new 
      family of hepatitis viruses. The data on the occurrence of TTV are highly 
      controversial: 1-22% in blood donors, 20-40% in hematological patients, 15-35% in 
      patients with liver diseases. The virus has been found to be transmitted by the 
      oral-fecal route as it penetrates via bile into feces and is then excreted from the 
      gastrointestinal tract. A relatively low percentage of the occurrence of TTV 
      infection in groups of risk may be regarded as the evidence that sexual and 
      injection routes are not the main route of its transmission. Further investigations 
      are necessary to establish the regularities of the epidemiology of TTV, to obtain 
      information on its pathogenicity and on the methods for diagnosing hepatitis caused 
      by this virus.

TI  - Genomic and molecular evolutionary analysis of a newly identified infectious agent 
      (SEN virus) and its relationship to the TT virus family.
PG  - 359-67
AB  - A new group of transmissible single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses (SENV) distantly 
      related to the large TT virus (TTV) family was recently identified. Eight different 
      SENV isolates have been found, some with an association with posttransfusion 
      hepatitis. A phylogenetic analysis of near-complete open-reading frame 1, including 
      conserved motifs and excluding recombinant regions, was performed. The analysis used 
      TTV-like minivirus as an outgroup, to determine a root of the phylogenetic tree, and 
      compared 8 SENV isolates, 6 prototype TTV isolates, and 7 TTV variants (including 
      SANBAN, TUS01, PMV, and YONBAN). Four distinct clusters separated by a bootstrap 
      value of 100% were observed. YONBAN isolates formed a distinct outer group, 
      representing the earliest recognized phylogenetic divergence (group 1). Prototype 
      TTV formed group 2, PMV formed group 3, and SENV, SANBAN, and TUS01 isolates formed 
      group 4, the most recently evolved group. This taxonomic classification suggests 
      that these circular ssDNA viruses probably evolved from a common ancestor virus.

TI  - TT virus levels in the plasma of infected individuals with different hepatic and

PG  - 189-95
AB  - TT virus (TTV) infection is extremely widespread in the general population. A 
      sensitive real-time PCR assay was developed that quantitated accurately the most 
      prevalent TTV genotypes in Italy. When used to test 217 individuals for TTV 
      viraemia, the overall prevalence was 94%. Viraemia levels varied widely amongst 
      individual subjects, with no major differences related to gender or age. The highest 
      TTV titres were in haemophiliacs and in patients with non-A-E hepatitis, but they 
      did not differ from the group with miscellaneous diseases. HIV- and HCV-infected 
      subjects and patients with primary liver diseases had TTV loads similar to those of 
      healthy individuals.

TI  - TTV infection and its relation to serum transaminases in apparently healthy blood 
      donors and in patients with clotting disorders who have been investigated previously 
      for hepatitis C virus and GBV-C/HGV infection in Belgium.
PG  - 561-6
AB  - A novel DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), has been proposed as a possible etiologic agent 
      for non A-E hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence 
      of TTV infection using PCR in healthy blood donors and in patients with clotting 
      disorders who have been investigated previously for GBV-C/HGV and HCV infection in 
      Belgium. In this study, PCR using primers proposed by Takahashi et al. [(1998) 
      Hepatology Research 12:233-239] proved far more sensitive than those used by Okamoto 
      et al. [(1998) Journal of Medical Virology 56:128-132]. The sequence of the PCR 
      products showed 87% identity to the published sequence. TTV was present in 29.7% of 
      healthy blood donors, a figure intermediate between the low rate of infection 
      observed in Scotland and the high rates in the Far East. TTV was detected in 46.5% 
      of 127 patients studied with clotting disorders as compared to 79.5% for HCV and 
      11.8% for GBV-C/HGV infection. However, there was no impact on the level of serum 
      transaminases. Treatment with interferon for HCV infection co-infected with TTV 
      suppressed temporarily serum TTV DNA. Therefore, it was concluded that TTV DNA is 
      detected frequently in serum of healthy blood donors in Belgium and more often in 
      patients with clotting disorders. TTV does not cause liver disease or contribute to 
      the severity of liver disease.

TI  - Distribution of TT virus genomic groups 1-5 in Brazilian blood donors, HBV carriers, 
      and HIV-1-infected patients.
PG  - 166-73
AB  - Human isolates of the highly prevalent TT virus (TTV) have been classified into five 
      major genomic groups (1-5). The geographical distribution of the groups throughout 
      the world is not well known. Five different PCR assays were developed in an attempt 
      to amplify specifically TTV DNAs of each genomic group. Serum samples collected from 
      72 Brazilian adults (24 voluntary blood donors, 24 hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, 
      and 24 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients) were tested. 
      TTV DNA from at least one genomic group was detected in 11 (46%) blood donors, 13 
      (54%) HBV carriers, and 24 (100%) HIV-1 patients. All five genomic groups were 
      detected in the three populations, with the exception of group 2 in blood donors. 
      Some samples, negative with all five specific assays, were positive with the 
      commonly used untranslated region (UTR) PCR system. On the other hand, TTV DNA was 
      detected in some samples by using specific assays but not with the UTR PCR. Mixed 
      infections with 2-5 TTV isolates from different groups were detected in 21% blood 
      donors, 29% HBV carriers, and 71% HIV-1 patients. Fifteen PCR products (three 
      obtained with each assay) were sequenced. Most sequences showed high (>86%) homology 
      with those of TTV isolates belonging to their presumed groups. However, three 
      sequences had low homology with all TTV sequences available from the DNA databanks. 
      In conclusion, TTV isolates belonging to all five known genomic groups circulate in 
      Brazil, and the results suggest the existence of new and as yet uncharacterised 
      major genomic groups.

AB  - Using PCR with primers derived from a non-coding region of the human TT virus (TTV) 
      genome, the TTV sequence in serum samples obtained from pigs (Sus domesticus), dogs 
      (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) was identified and the entire genomic 
      sequence was determined for each representative isolate. Three TTV isolates 
      (Sd-TTV31 from a pig, Cf-TTV10 from a dog and Fc-TTV4 from a cat) comprising 2878, 
      2797 and 2064 nucleotides, respectively, each had three open reading frames (ORFs) 
      encoding 436-635 (ORF1), 73-105 (ORF2) and 224-243 (ORF3) aa but lacked ORF4, 
      similar to tupaia TTV. ORF3 was presumed to arise from a splicing of TTV mRNA, 
      similar to human prototype TTV. Although the nucleotide sequence of Sd-TTV31, 
      Cf-TTV10 and Fc-TTV4 differed by more than 50% from each other and from previously 
      reported TTVs of 3.4-3.9 kb and TTV-like mini viruses (TLMVs) of 2.8-3.0 kb isolated 
      from humans and non-human primates as well as tupaia TTVs of 2.2 kb, they resembled 
      known TTVs and TLMVs with regard to genomic organization and presumed 
      transcriptional profile rather than animal circoviruses of 1.7-2.3 kb. Phylogenetic 
      analysis revealed that Sd-TTV31, Cf-TTV10 and Fc-TTV4 were closer to TTVs from 
      lower-order primates and tupaias than to TTVs from higher-order primates and TLMVs. 
      These results indicate that domestic pigs, cats and dogs are naturally infected with 
      species-specific TTVs with small genomic size and suggest a wide distribution of 
      TTVs with extremely divergent genomic sequence and length in animals.

TI  - Genoprevalence of TT virus among clinical and auxiliary UK dental healthcare 
      workers: a pilot study.
PG  - 554-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: In 1997 a new human hepatotropic virus, TT virus (TTV), was identified. 
      The clinical significance of TT virus infection remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To 
      undertake an initial evaluation of the genoprevalence of TTV DNA among health care 
      workers in the United Kingdom. SETTING: A UK dental hospital. STUDY DESIGN: The sera 
      of 53 dental healthcare workers (9 dentists, 14 dental nurses and 30 office staff) 
      were tested for the presence of TTV DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). 
      RESULTS: TT virus DNA was detected in 3 out of 53 (5.7%) samples. This frequency of 
      TTV carriage is similar to that of blood donors and healthy persons in the UK. 
      CONCLUSION: The present data suggest that dental healthcare workers in the UK are 
      not at increased risk of nosocomial acquisition of TT virus.

TI  - Prevalence and genotypic distribution of TT virus in Athens, Greece.
PG  - 423-9
AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection in various population groups from Athens, 
      Greece, was assessed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two primer sets 
      from distinct regions of the genome: the conventional set derived from the open 
      reading frame-1 (ORF-1) and the new, highly sensitive set targeting the region that 
      includes the TATA signal localized upstream of ORF-2. Based on both primer sets, TTV 
      DNA was detected in 42/50 (84.0%) healthy individuals, 42/50 (84.0%) chronic 
      hepatitis C patients, 31/39 (79.5%) acute non-A-E hepatitis patients (group I), 
      14/16 (87.5%) renal failure patients with acute non-A-E hepatitis (group II), 47/50 
      (94.0%) intravenous drug users (IVDU), 36/50 (72.0%) hemophiliacs, and 21/31 (67.7%) 
      hemodialysis patients. The presence of TTV was not associated with any particular 
      risk group, and no differences were observed in relation to demographic, biochemical 
      and virological characteristics between TTV DNA-positive and -negative patients. TTV 
      did not seem to have a profound effect on the course of chronic C or acute non-A-E 
      hepatitis either. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TTV strains circulating in the 
      greater metropolitan area of Athens belong not only to the G1 and G2 genotypes that 
      are encountered worldwide, but also to G3 and to G5 that are found mainly in Europe 
      and Asia, respectively. Further studies will shed light on the role of this highly 
      prevalent virus.

TI  - Effect of TT virus co-infection on interferon response in chronic hepatitis C 
      patients.
PG  - 351-5
AB  - AIM: TT virus (TTV) is a single stranded DNA virus found in serum of patients with 
      post-transfusion non-A to -G hepatitis. TTV-DNA has been investigated in sera of 
      patients with various liver diseases. This study aimed at finding whether 
      co-infection with TTV in HCV patients, may influence the effect of interferon (IFN) 
      in complete elimination of HCV, and analysed the correlation between HCV and TTV by 
      semi-quantification of both HCV RNAs and TTV DNA. METHODS: In 28 chronic hepatitis C 
      (CH-C) patients with TTV co-infection, the presence of TTV DNA was checked in sera 
      six months before and after the end of IFN therapy. RESULT: Five out of 28 patients 
      became negative for both HCV-RNA and TTV-DNA following IFN therapy. But 10 out of 28 
      patients persistently remained positive for both. Among the remaining 13 patients, 5 
      tested negative for HCV-RNA but positive for TTV-DNA. Post IFN therapy changes in 
      serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels did not appear to be influenced by the 
      presence of TTV co-infection. HCV-RNA was found to be the most important predictor 
      of IFN response in CH-C patients with TTV co-infection. TTV DNA level in sera had no 
      correlation with IFN response. In addition, there was no relationship between HCV 
      RNA and TTV DNA. CONCLUSION: Based on these results, it can be concluded that the 
      effectiveness of IFN in eliminating HCV does not seem to be influenced by 
      co-infection.

TI  - TTV viral load as a marker for immune reconstitution after initiation of HAART in 
      HIV-infected patients.
PG  - 287-95
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate whether TT virus (TTV) viral load may be used as a surrogate 
      marker for functional immune reconstitution in HIV-infected patients receiving 
      highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). METHOD: Fifteen protease 
      inhibitor-naïve HIV-infected patients were included in a longitudinal study. From 
      each patient, three serum samples taken before HAART initiation and three samples 
      taken during HAART were analyzed. TTV was detected by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) and was quantitated by competitive PCR. TTV viral heterogeneity was determined 
      by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and sequencing. RESULTS: All 15 
      HIV-infected patients were TTV positive. No significant change in HIV RNA or TTV 
      viral load was observed at the three time points before HAART initiation. Even 
      though HAART lead to an immediate and significant reduction in HIV RNA (p =.0001), a 
      significant reduction in TTV viral load (p =.0002) was not observed until after 3-5 
      months of HAART. Four patients did not have an increase in CD4+ T cell count after 1 
      year of HAART; however, a decrease in TTV viral load was still observed, and three 
      of these patients had a reduction in HIV RNA. RFLPs and sequencing revealed that TTV 
      is represented as a heterogeneous population of virus in HIV-infected patients. 
      CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that HAART leads to improved immunological 
      responses, even in patients who do not have an increase in CD4+ T cell counts. We 
      propose that the change in TTV viral load may be useful in the evaluation of 
      cellular immune response at a functional level in HIV-infected patients who receive 
      HAART.

TI  - Age-specific prevalence, transmission and phylogeny of TT virus in the Czech 
      Republic.
PG  - 56
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus is prevalent worldwide, but its prevalence and genotype 
      distribution in Central and East-Europe has not been determined. The high prevalence 
      of TTV in multiply-transfused patients points to the importance of a parenteral mode 
      of transmission, but since more than half of the general population is infected 
      other possible routes of transmission must be considered. METHODS: In our study, we 
      investigated the epidemiology, transmission and phylogeny of TTV in the Czech 
      Republic. The following groups were selected: a control group of 196 blood donors, 
      20 patients with hemophilia, 49 intravenous drug users, 100 sex workers, 50 
      penitentiary prisoners, 208 healthy children aged 1 to 14 years, 54 cord blood 
      samples, 52 patients with non-A-E hepatitis, 74 patients with hepatitis C, and 51 
      blood donors with increased ALT levels. Primers specific for the non-coding region 
      were used. The genotype distribution was studied in 70 TTV-positive samples. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence rate of TTV among the Czech population was 52.6%. We have 
      shown that TTV is not transmitted prenatally. Children were infected after birth 
      with two peaks: one at the age of two years and the other after the beginning of 
      primary school. Adults have shown a further increase in the TTV prevalence with age. 
      The highest TTV prevalence was found in the group of patients who had received 
      multiple blood transfusions. The TTV prevalence rate in subjects at an increased 
      risk of sexual transmission was not significantly higher than in the general 
      population. Genotypes G2 and G1 were most prevalent among the Czech population, 
      followed by G8 and G3. The subjects positive for markers of HBV and/or HCV infection 
      tested significantly more often TTV DNA positive, which is suggestive of a common 
      route of transmission of these three infections. CONCLUSIONS: This study on TTV 
      prevalence, mode of transmission and age-specific prevalence is the most extensive 
      study performed in Central and Eastern Europe. It showed insights into the 
      epidemiology of TTV infection, but failed to associate TTV infection with clinical 
      manifestations.

TI  - [Hemorheologic changes in patients with liver diseases].
PG  - 280-2
AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the variation of the hemorheology and microcirculation in 
      different period of liver diseases. METHODS: Indices for hemorheology, liver 
      function, HBV DNA and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) DNA were measured in 82 
      patients with liver diseases and correlative analysis was made. RESULTS: The 
      low-shear whole blood viscosity (BV) and RBC aggregation index were significantly 
      higher in hepatitis B group than those in the control group (P less than 0.05). No 
      correlation was found between HBV DNA and indices of hemorheology (P greater than 
      0.05). The high-shear and low-shear BV and hematocrit (HCT) were significantly lower 
      in decompensated cirrhosis group than those in the control group (P less than 0.05). 
      RBC aggregation index, plasma viscosity (PV) and the low-shear BV were significantly 
      higher in compensated cirrhosis group than those in the control group (P less than 
      0.05). The high-shear and low-shear BV were significantly higher in TTV positive 
      group than those in the control group. CONCLUSION: There is disturbance of 
      microcirculation in the body of patients with hepatitis B or TTV infection. The 
      blood of patients with compensated cirrhosis is in highly viscose status and in low 
      viscose status in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. TTV seems to be harmful to 
      some degree to the body. The hemorheology should be an index in detecting liver 
      diseases in addition to HBV markers.

TI  - [Hepatotropism of nonenveloped DNA virus in rhesus monkey infected by 
      transfusion-transmitted virus].
PG  - 291-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study wether the nonenveloped DNA virus transmitted via blood 
      transfusion is hepatotropic. METHODS: Total DNA was extracted from tissues of 5 
      experimentally infected Rhesus monkeys. A dot hybridization was done with virus 
      double DNA strand probe or single antisense strand probe. RESULTS: Both single- and 
      double-strand probes were hybridized with DNA of the liver, spleen, stomach, small 
      intestine and colon. The virus was conformed present in most of all the organs when 
      double-strand probe was used. The positive was noted only in the liver and small 
      intestine when single-strand antisense probe was used, which showed that in liver 
      and small intestine might have replicative intermediates of the virus. CONCLUSION: 
      It suggests that nonenveloped DNA virus replicate in the liver and small intestine, 
      so it might be hepatotropic.

TI  - [Investigation of transplacental transmission of TT virus in mother--newborn pairs].
PG  - 71-7
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widespread throughout the world and can be detected in 50-95% of 
      healthy individuals. However, in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients 
      coinfected with TTV, histological activity indices were higher than patients with 
      HCV infection alone. There are studies which indicate that TTV can cause aplastic 
      anemia and thrombocytopenia. While TTV is known to be transmitted through blood 
      transfusions and by fecal-oral route, published information on transplasental 
      transmission is controversial. The aims of this study were to detect the frequency 
      of TTV infection among healthy pregnant women and to search whether TTV is 
      transmitted transplasentally during pregnancy. For this purpose, plasma samples 
      collected from 54 women and their newborns were investigated by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR), and viral loads were determined for infected newborns, and their 
      respective mothers. Also, ten mothers whose newborns were tested negative for 
      TTV-DNA were enrolled in viral load tests for comparison. TTV-DNA was detected in 49 
      (90.7%) of 54 women. Of 49 newborns whose mothers were infected with TTV, only 4 
      (8.2%) were found positive for TTV-DNA. There was no statistically significant 
      difference in TTV-DNA loads between mothers who transmitted the virus and those who 
      did not (Mann-Whitney U analysis Z=-0.071, P=0.944). As a result, transplasental 
      transmission of TTV is possible but occurs in low frequency and independent of viral 
      load.

TI  - Isolate KAV: a new genotype of the TT-virus family.
PG  - 937-41
AB  - A novel DNA sequence belonging to a new genotype of TT virus (TTV) was detected by 
      long-distance PCR in the serum of a chronically HCV-infected patient. The isolate 
      was designated KAV according to the patient's initials. Extending the sequence to 
      full length revealed a 3705-nt viral genome, which is about 100 nucleotides shorter 
      than the other TT-viruses. KAV showed common features with the TTV family, such as 
      the organization of open reading frames and conserved noncoding regions. The largest 
      open reading frame of KAV (ORF 1) was about 40 aa shorter than that of other 
      TT-viruses. Overall sequence homology with known TTV isolates was less than 66%. 
      Phylogenetic analysis poses KAV in one major group with three recently published TTV 
      sequences. So KAV can be considered as a new genotype of the TTV family 
      (provisionally designated genotype 28).

TI  - Genomic and evolutionary characterization of TT virus (TTV) in tupaias and 
      comparison with species-specific TTVs in humans and non-human primates.
PG  - 2041-2050
LID - 10.1099/0022-1317-82-9-2041 [doi]
AB  - TT virus (TTV) was recovered from the sera of tupaias (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) 
      by PCR using primers derived from the noncoding region of the human TTV genome, and 
      its entire genomic sequence was determined. One tupaia TTV isolate (Tbc-TTV14) 
      consisted of only 2199 nucleotides (nt) and had three open reading frames (ORFs), 
      spanning 1506 nt (ORF1), 177 nt (ORF2) and 642 nt (ORF3), which were in the same 
      orientation as the ORFs of the human prototype TTV (TA278). ORF3 was presumed to 
      arise from a splicing of TTV mRNA, similar to reported human TTVs whose spliced 
      mRNAs have been identified, and encoded a joint protein of 214 amino acids with a 
      Ser-, Lys- and Arg-rich sequence at the C terminus. Tbc-TTV14 was less than 50% 
      similar to previously reported TTVs of 3.4-3.9 kb and TTV-like mini viruses (TLMVs) 
      of 2.8-3.0 kb isolated from humans and non-human primates, and known animal 
      circoviruses. Although Tbc-TTV14 has a genomic length similar to animal circoviruses 
      (1.8-2.3 kb), Tbc-TTV14 resembled TTVs and TLMVs with regard to putative genomic 
      organization and transcription profile. Conserved motifs were commonly observed in 
      the coding and noncoding regions of the Tbc-TTV14 genome and in all TTV and TLMV 
      genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Tbc-TTV14 is the closest to TLMVs, and 
      is closer to TTVs isolated from tamarin and douroucouli than to TTVs isolated from 
      humans and chimpanzees. These results indicate that tupaias are naturally infected 
      with a new TTV species that has not been identified among primates.

TI  - Relationships between TT virus infection and hepatitis C virus response to 
      interferon therapy in doubly infected patients.
PG  - 176-82
AB  - A group of 24 well-characterized patients doubly infected with hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) and TT virus (TTV) were studied to evaluate whether the loads and number or 
      identity of the genogroups of TTV they carried could affect the response of HCV 
      infection to interferon-alpha (IFN) treatment. The features of HCV infection in the 
      study patients provided a fair representation of the variables that are usually 
      found in considering patients for IFN treatment. The same was true for the features 
      of TTV infection. In particular, plasma loads of TTV varied over a wide range in 
      individual patients, and infection with multiple TTV genogroups was extremely 
      frequent. TTV genogroups 1 and 3 were the most prevalent, followed by genogroups 4 
      and 5. The HCV response to IFN was evaluated by measuring plasma viraemia at 24 
      hours and 30 days after initiation of treatment. The results showed that the TTV 
      parameters investigated had little or no impact on the response of HCV to therapy. 
      Due to study design, these results do not exclude that the presence of a concomitant 
      TTV infection can affect how HCV infection responds to treatment. However, they 
      indicate that, should such effects exist, they would be independent on load and 
      genetic features of the infecting TTV.

      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by real-time detection PCR using primers and a probe 
      derived from the well-conserved untranslated region of the TTV genome, which can 
      detect all known TTV genotypes. Of the 237 patients studied, 18 (8%) were negative 
      for TTV DNA, 87 (37%) had low TTV viremia (1.3 x 10(2)-9.9 x 10(3) copies/ml), and 
      132 (56%) had high TTV viremia (1.0 x 10(4)-2.1 x 10(6) copies/ml). Various features 
      were compared between the patients with high TTV load (n = 132) and those with no 
      TTV viremia or low viral load (n = 105). High TTV viremia (> or =10(4) copies/ml) 
      was significantly associated with higher age (P < 0.05), past history of blood 
      transfusion (P < 0.001), complication of cirrhosis (P < 0.05) or HCC (P < 0.0005), 
      lower HCV RNA titer (P < 0.05), and lower platelet count (P < 0.01). On multivariate 
      logistic regression analysis, high TTV viral load was a significant risk factor for 
      HCC (P < 0.05), independent from known risk factors such as complication of liver 
      cirrhosis (P < 0.0001) and high age (> or =65 years, P < 0.05), among all 237 
      patients. Furthermore, high TTV viral load was an independent risk factor for HCC 
      among the 90 cirrhotic patients (P < 0.05). These results suggest that a high TTV 
      viral load is associated independently with the complication of HCC and may have 
      prognostic significance in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, although 
      whether high TTV viremia mediates the progression of HCV-related chronic liver 
      disease remains to be defined.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is 
      hepatotropic. METHODS: Total DNA was extracted from various tissues of 5 
      experimentally infected Rhesus monkeys during the viremic period. A dot 
      hybridization was done with viral double stranded DNA probes or single antisense 
      probes. RESULTS: The double-stranded probe was hybridized with DNA from the liver, 
      bone marrow, spleen,stomach, small intestine and colon. The single-stranded 
      antisense probe was hybridized with DNA from the liver, small intestine and bone 
      marrow of all 5 monkeys, but not with that from other tissues. CONCLUSIONS: As the 
      viral genome was of negative polarity, the plus-stranded fragment identified in our 
      study might be a replicative intermediate, and was only demonstrated in the liver, 
      small intestine, and bone marrow by dot blot hybridization with single-stranded 
      antisense probes. It is suggested that the TTV replicates in the liver, bone marrow 
      and small intestine, and TTV might be hepatotropic.

AB  - A novel TT virus (TTV)-like DNA sequence was detected in the serum of a patient (PM) 
      with acute non-A-E hepatitis. The full-length genome sequence, referred to here as 
      PM virus (PMV), was obtained and its relationship to other full or near full-length 
      TTV sequences examined. Although it shares a common genomic arrangement and short 
      conserved regions, the majority of the genome is extremely divergent, displaying an 
      average genetic distance of 0.60 from all other TTV sequences. By comparing PMV with 
      TTV genomes representing the most divergent types so far described, six major groups 
      can be distinguished. The level of genetic diversity seen between these genomes is 
      higher than would be expected within a single virus species. Indeed, PMV could be 
      considered the prototype of an independent taxonomic group within the Circoviridae: 
      family. A genoprevalence study of sera from blood donors and patients with acute 
      hepatitis suggests that PMV is rare.

TI  - TT virus infection and genotype distribution in blood donors and a group of patients 
      from Turkey.
PG  - 299-302
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) DNA has been found in a large proportion of patients with 
      different forms of non-A-G hepatitis, however the clinical importance is unclear. We 
      aimed to determine the genotypes of TTV isolates found in blood donors and different 
      patient groups from the western part of Turkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TT DNA was 
      investigated in serum samples of 91 volunteer blood donors (BD), 105 thalassemia 
      (TH) patients, ten patients with fulminant hepatitis (FH) and 16 hemodialysis (HD) 
      patients by heminested PCR using primers NG059, NG061 and NG063 from the ORF1 
      region. 39 isolates were genotyped by analyzing the partial sequence of ORF1. 
      RESULTS: TTV DNA was found in 75% of HD, 80% of FH, 61% of TH patients and in 51.6% 
      of BD. Among the sequenced isolates, 14 (35.9%) belonged to genotype 1 (G1) and 25 
      (64.1%) belonged to genotype 2 (G2). Among the G2 sequences, 22 were grouped as G2c. 
      CONCLUSION: TTV infection was common in the population studied, even with moderately 
      sensitive primers. G2 was the major genotype of the studied population without any 
      significant differences in distribution between various patient groups and BD.

TI  - Three spliced mRNAs of TT virus transcribed from a plasmid containing the entire 
      genome in COS1 cells.
PG  - 9980-6
AB  - A permuted whole-genome construct of a TT virus (TTV), named VT416, had 3,852 
      nucleotides (nt) 98.2% similar to the prototype TA278 genome. To allow the 
      transcription of TTV from the internal promoter, pBK*VT416(1.3G), carrying 1.3 units 
      of VT416, was constructed. The poly(A)(+) RNAs expressed in COS1 cells 48 h 
      posttransfection contained three TTV mRNA species 3.0, 1.2, and 1.0 kb in length, 
      which were recovered in the 13 DNA clones from a lambda phage cDNA library. These 
      mRNAs in the antigenomic orientation possessed in common the 3' terminus downstream 
      of a poly(A) signal (A(3073)ATAAA) and the 5' terminus downstream of a cap site 
      (C(98)ACTTC). A common splicing to join nt 185 with nt 277 was detected in all 
      mRNAs. The coding region of the largest open reading frame (ORF) was maintained in 
      3.0-kb mRNA, because this splicing was located upstream of its initiation codon 
      (A(589)TG). The second splicing was detected in 1.2-kb mRNA to join nt 711 with nt 
      2374 and in 1.0-kb mRNA to bind nt 711 to nt 2567. They linked a proposed ORF2 to 
      another ORF for creating new ORFs over nt 2374 to 2872 in frame 2 and nt 2567 to 
      3074 in frame 3. The donor and acceptor sites of all three splicings matched the 
      consensus sequence and were conserved in most of the 16 TTVs of distinct genotypes 
      retrieved from the database. The observed transcription profile is unique to TTV 
      among known members in the family Circoviridae.

TI  - Species-specific TT viruses in humans and nonhuman primates and their phylogenetic 
      relatedness.
PG  - 368-78
AB  - By means of polymerase chain reaction with a primer pair (NG133-NG147) deduced from 
      the untranslated region (UTR) of TT virus (TTV), TTVs with markedly distinct genomic 
      lengths were recovered from sera of humans and nonhuman primates, and their entire 
      nucleotide sequences were determined. A human TTV [TGP96 of 2908 nucleotides (nt)] 
      was obtained that was about 900 nt shorter than heretofore reported TTVs (3787-3853 
      nt). Likewise, TTVs of chimpanzee occurred in two distinct genomic sizes [Pt-TTV6 
      (3690 nt) and Pt-TTV8-II (2785 nt)]. Two TTVs of Japanese macaque [Mf-TTV3 (3798 nt) 
      and Mf-TTV9 (3763 nt)] were comparable in genomic length, but only 55% similar in 
      sequence. These five human and nonhuman primate TTVs, along with TTVs of tamarin 
      [So-TTV2 (3371 nt)] and douroucouli [At-TTV3 (3718 nt)], were compared over the 
      entire nucleotide sequence. Although the seven TTVs were only < or = 55% similar, 
      they share a common genomic organization with two open reading frames (ORFs), 
      designated ORF1 (654-735 amino acids) and ORF2 (91-152 amino acids). The N-terminal 
      sequences of ORF1 proteins were rich in arginine, and sequence motifs necessary for 
      transcription and replication were conserved among them all. Like the human 
      prototype TTV (TA278), all seven TTVs from various animals possessed in common two 
      15-nt sequences (CGAATGGCTGAGTTT and AGGGGCAATTCGGGC) in the UTR that were covered 
      by NG133 and NG147, respectively. These primers would be instrumental in research on 
      TTVs in previously unexamined species for defining their virological characteristics 
      and evolutionary relationships.

TI  - TT virus infection in healthy children, children after blood transfusion, and 
      children with non-A to E hepatitis or other liver diseases in Taiwan.
PG  - 66-71
AB  - Serum samples from healthy and diseased children were studied for the presence of 
      TTV DNA by nested PCR using primer sets generated from N-22 region and from the 
      untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome. N-22 positive TTV DNA was detectable 
      in 33 (27%) of 122 healthy children, 47 (73.4%) of 64 polytransfused thalassemic 
      children, 37 (46.3%) of 80 children who received transfusion during cardiac surgery, 
      8 (42.1%) of 19 non-A to E hepatitis, 10 (33.3%) of 30 HBV carrier children, and 5 
      (15.6%) of 32 infants with biliary atresia. A much higher prevalence of TTV DNA with 
      rates varying from 78-100% in the above study groups was observed using the UTR 
      primers. For children with N-22 positive TTV DNA, biochemical assessment of isolated 
      TTV viremia in thalassemic children or children transfused during surgery showed no 
      convincing association between raised ALT levels and TTV viremia. Coinfection with 
      TTV in chronic HCV-infected or HBV-infected children did not result in higher peak 
      ALT levels during follow-up, suggesting that TTV has no synergistic pathogenic 
      effect. The phylogenetic analysis of the N-22 positive TTV DNA isolates revealed 
      that most isolates from healthy children, children transfused during surgery, and 
      non-A to E fulminant hepatitis children were type 1 TTV. These results indicate that 
      TTV infection in children was significantly associated with transfusion. TTV 
      infection is highly prevalent in early childhood in Taiwan but plays a minimal role 
      in the induction of hepatitis in children.

TI  - [Investigation of TT virus-DNA in multitransfused children and healthy children].
PG  - 63-71
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a naked, single stranded DNA virus, which has been discovered in 
      the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. TTV is 
      widespread in the population, however, the mode of its transmission is unclear. This 
      study was conducted to search for TTV-DNA positivity rates and its relationship with 
      the clinical outcomes of recipients who underwent multiple blood or blood product 
      transfusion, together with healthy children. TTV-DNA was investigated in 52 
      multitransfused pediatric patients (age range: 3 mnths - 17.5 yrs, mean age: 9.2 +/- 
      5.7 years) and 18 healthy children (age range: 1 mnth - 16.5 yrs, mean age: 8.1 +/- 
      4.9 years), by qualitative in-house semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with 
      the primers NG059, NG061 and NG063, generated from ORF1 region of the viral genome. 
      TTV-DNA was found positive in 30.8% of multitransfused, and 16.7% of healthy 
      children. The differences of TTV-DNA positivity rates between the multitransfused 
      and control groups, and ALT values between the patients with positive and negative 
      TTV-DNA, were statistically insignificant (p>0.05). As a result, no relationship was 
      detected between TTV positivity and hepatitis, although there was a statistically 
      insignificant increase of TTV-DNA positivity in multitransfused children. However, 
      since the primers of ORF1 N22 region used in our PCR method did not have enough 
      sensitivity for the detection of TTV-DNA, it has been concluded that more sensitive 
      primers such as UTR primers, should be used for more reliable evaluation of the 
      results.

TI  - Molecular characterization of porcine TT virus, an orphan virus, in pigs from six 
      different countries.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - Human TT virus (TTV), originally isolated from a patient with post-transfusion 
      hepatitis in 1997, is ubiquitous and non-pathogenic. Viruses related to human TTV 
      have since been identified in non-human primates, bovine, ovine, porcine, feline, 
      and canine. The objective of this study was to genetically characterize porcine TTV 
      from pigs in different geographic regions. PCR primers based on the non-coding 
      region of the only available porcine TTV isolate were designed to amplify porcine 
      TTV DNA from sera of pigs in six different countries. Porcine TTV DNA was detected 
      in 66.2% (102/154) of the swine sera. The percentages of positive pigs varied 
      greatly from country to country and even within the same country: 33% in Iowa, USA; 
      40% in Thailand; 46% in Ontario, Canada; 80% in China; 85% in Korea; 90% in Spain; 
      100% in Quebec and Saskatchewan, Canada. A total of 40 porcine TTV isolates (five 
      from each geographic region) were sequenced for a 218 bp fragment within the 
      non-coding region. Sequence analyses revealed that porcine TTV isolates from 
      different geographic regions shared 86-100% nucleotide sequence identity to each 
      other. The prototype Japanese isolate of porcine TTV, Sd-TTV31, shared 90-97% 
      nucleotide sequence identity with porcine TTV isolates reported in this study. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that the clustering of the porcine TTV isolates is not 
      associated with geographic origins. Although porcine TTV is not known to be 
      associated with any swine disease, co-infection of pigs with TTV and other known 
      swine pathogens may result in enhanced disease. There are also concerns for risk of 
      potential human infection during xenotransplantation.

TI  - Transfusion-associated TT virus co-infection in patients with hepatitis C virus is 
      associated with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia but not with B-cell non-Hodgkin 
      lymphoma.
PG  - 39-44
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of TT virus (TMV) infection in a series of 
      patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with or without benign 
      (mixed cryoglobulinemia) or malignant (B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL)) 
      lymphoproliferative disease. METHODS: Sixty-six HCV patients were studied, including 
      patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (n=30), B-NHL (n=15), and no mixed 
      cryoglobulinemia or B-NHL (n=21). All HCV patients had increased transaminase levels 
      and were HCV RNA positive. Patients were considered to have mixed cryoglobulinemia 
      if two successive determinations of their serum cryoglobulin level were above 0.05 
      g/L. Mixed cryoglobulinemia-negative patients never had mixed cryoglobulins in their 
      serum on multiple determinations. Subjects without HCV infection included 79 
      patients with histologically proven B-NHL, and 50 healthy blood donors. Serum 
      samples were analyzed for TTV DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction, with two 
      couples of primers in different regions of the genome, in two independent 
      laboratories. RESULTS: In the group of HCV-positive patients, TTV DNA was found in 
      one of 15 (6.7%) patients with B-NHL, and in nine of 51 (17.6%, P = 0.43) of those 
      without B-NHL. Among HCV-positive patients without B-NHL, TTV DNA was more 
      frequently found in those with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis than in 
      those without it (six of 16 (37.5%) versus two of 21 (9.5%), P = 0.05). In subjects 
      without HCV infection, TTV DNA was present in 10 of 79 (12.7%) patients with B-NHL 
      and in seven of 50 (14.0%, P = 0.82) blood donors. CONCLUSION: In patients 
      chronically infected with HCV, TTV co-infection: (1) is not associated with the 
      presence of B-NHL; and (2) is more frequently found in patients presenting a type II 
      mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.

      viruses. BACKGROUND: Anelloviruses are a ubiquitous group of viruses without a clear 
      disease association. Although there is little evidence that they are pathogenic per 
      se, they may have the ability to modify ongoing disease processes. They have a high 
      degree of heterogeneity both within populations and across geographic regions. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three sets of donor samples were analysed by nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridisation. A proportion of amplified samples 
      were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. RESULTS: The prevalence 
      figures (including mixed D + H infection) were established for SENV D: 1·0, 8·4 and 
      25·2% and H: 12·5, 34·8 and 61·0% in Scottish, Czech and Ghanaian blood donors, 
      respectively. The compilation of prevalence figures indicates the changing ratio of 
      SENV D/H in west-east direction, most obvious between Western Europe (D/H < 1) and 
      far East Asia (D/H > 1). Phylogenetic analysis grouped the samples mostly in 
      accordance with geographic origin, despite the variability of short sequence 
      analysed. The previously indicated link between SENV prevalence and age was 
      statistically significant in this study, only for SENV H in Czech samples. 
      CONCLUSION: SENV D and H appear to reflect the incidence of other blood-borne 
      viruses in these locations. SENV H prevalence of 45·4% in Ghana represents the 
      highest single-SENV-genotype prevalence described in blood donors to date.

TI  - TT virus infection in Italy: prevalence and genotypes in healthy subjects, viral 
      liver diseases and asymptomatic infections by parenterally transmitted viruses.
PG  - 384-90
AB  - This study was aimed to evaluate TT virus prevalence in subjects with hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
      infections in patients affected by hepatitis of unknown origin (non-A-non-E 
      hepatitis) and in healthy subjects who had not been exposed to HBV, HCV and HIV. A 
      total of 317 subjects were tested; 40 were HBsAg asymptomatic carriers, 57 subjects 
      were anti-HCV positive (45 without chronic hepatitis and 12 with HCV-related chronic 
      hepatitis), and 27 had chronic non-A-non-E hepatitis. Fifty-seven subjects were 
      intravenous drug users (IVDUs) (52 with HCV or/and HIV infections), seven patients 
      underwent a liver transplant for fulminant hepatitis and 137 were healthy subjects 
      from the general population. Overall, TTV-DNA was detected in 62 subjects (19.6%): 
      in 17.9% of the HBsAg carriers, in 14% of the anti-HCV-positive patients (in 8.3% 
      and in 15.5% of patients with and without chronic hepatitis, respectively), in 22.2% 
      of non-A-non-E hepatitis patients, in 22.8% of IVDUs, in 57.1% of fulminant 
      hepatitis patients. TTV-DNA was also found in 20.4% healthy subjects. The prevalence 
      in the different subgroups was not statistically different. The genotypes were 
      identified in 40 of the 62 (64.5%) TTV-DNA positive samples: genotype 1a in 17.5%, 
      1b in 27.5%, genotype 2 in 27.5%, genotype 3 in 15.0%, genotype 4 in 5.0% and 
      genotype 5 in 7.5%; the genotype distribution in the subsets of patients was not 
      significantly different. In conclusion, this study showed that TTV infection is 
      common in Italy; it is widespread throughout the entire population and five 
      genotypes are present in Sardinia. Our results further dismiss the role of TTV as 
      cofactor in influencing the clinical course of infections with other hepatitis 
      viruses as well as the role of HIV in enhancing TTV transmission and replication.

TI  - Epidemiology and clinical significance of chronic hepatitis-related viruses 
      infection in hemodialysis patients from Taiwan.
PG  - 148-53
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A novel DNA virus which was designated TT virus (TTV) in 1997 was 
      considered a possible hepatitis-related virus, like hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B 
      (HBV) and GB virus C/hepatitis G viruses (GBV-C/HGV). In the present study, the 
      molecular epidemiology and clinical significance of TTV, GBV-C/HGV and HCV infection 
      in hemodialysis patients from Taiwan are investigated. METHODS: Sera of 85 patients 
      on maintenance hemodialysis were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
      hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), second-generation HCV antibody (anti-HCV), 
      anti-envelope protein 2 antibody (anti-E2) and RNA of GBV-C/HGV, HCV RNA and TTV 
      DNA. Sera of patients with positive TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA or HCV RNA were tested 
      for viruses 2 years later. RESULTS: Seven (8.2%) 29 (34.1%), 21 (24.7%), 12 (14.1%) 
      and 9 (10.6%) hemodialysis patients were positive for HBsAg, Anti-HCV, HCV RNA, 
      GBV-C/HGV RNA and anti-E2, respectively. TTV DNA was positive in 46 (54.1%) 
      patients. Neither clinical nor virological factors were associated with TTV viremia. 
      The ALT level was significantly elevated in HCV RNA-positive individuals than 
      -negative ones (34.5 vs. 12.5%, p < 0.05). TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and HCV RNA 
      remained detectable in sera of 31 (86.1%), 6 (50%) and 21 (100%) patients collected 
      2 years after first diagnosis of viremia. CONCLUSION: Among Taiwanese hemodialysis 
      patients, TTV infection is highly prevalent. No clinical or virological factor was 
      observed to be significantly associated with TTV infection. The ALT abnormality was 
      mainly attributable to HCV but not TTV infection in Taiwanese hemodialysis patients.

TI  - [Rapid detection of genotypes of TT virus using a heteroduplex mobility assay].
PG  - 801-5
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a simple, sensitive, specific and less-costly method for 
      detecting genotypes of TT virus (TTV). METHODS: TTV DNA was tested by nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) in sera from 180 patients with different types of 
      viral hepatitis and 96 normal individuals in Beijing. TTV genotypes were determined 
      in 40 sera collected from TTV DNA positive patients by heteroduplex mobility assay 
      (HMA) and through sequencing. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV DNA in viral 
      hepatitis patients and normal individuals were 22.2% (40/180) and 19.8% (19/96), 
      respectively (chi(2) = 0.220, P = 0.639). TTV DNA positive rates of patients with 
      hepatitis A, B, C, E and non-A to E were 20.0% (6/30), 16.7% (5/30), 23.3% (7/30), 
      36.7% (11/30) and 18.3% (11/60), respectively. Of 40 TTV DNA positive patients, 20 
      (50.0%) were TTV G1, 7 (17.5%) TTV G2, 10 (25.0%) coinfected with different 
      genotypes of TTV, and 3 untyped by HMA. Twenty G1 and 7 G2 detected by HMA were 
      confirmed by sequence analysis. Of 10 patients coinfected with different genotypes 
      of TTV, 5 were G1 and G2, 2 G1 and G3, 1 G1 and G4, 1 G1 and G3, and 1 with G1, G2 
      and G3 coinfections. CONCLUSION: HMA was recognized as simple, sensitive, specific 
      and less-costly, thus could be used for genotyping of TTV.

TI  - Prevalence of SENV-H and SENV-D virus: epidemiological study in blood donors and 
      dialysis patients.
PG  - 441-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, the identification of the SEN virus as a possible 
      etiological agent of parental transmission hepatitis led to the study of the 
      prevalence of such pathogen agents, particularly SENV-H, in our population. This 
      paper compares the rate prevalence in high-risk subjects, such as dialysis patients, 
      and low-risk subjects, such as blood donors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was 
      carried out on SEN virus DNA extracted from serum of dialysis patients and blood 
      donors, and the presence of viral genomes was performed by the nested PCR method. 
      RESULTS: The results showed a higher prevalence in male blood donors, supporting the 
      hypothesis of an epidemiological role for sexual and also parental transmission, as 
      is clearly demonstrated by the high prevalence in dialysis patients. The result 
      reduced the importance of the possible etiological role of the SEN virus due to the 
      high percentage of positivity in healthy population, and it induces one to consider 
      poorly significant the pathogenicity of such viral agents. CONCLUSION: For this 
      instance, the authors, in agreement with the phylogenically related TT virus, 
      described SEN viruses as absolutely not pathogens and considered them as "simple 
      guests."

TI  - Mother-to-infant transmission of TT virus: prevalence, extent and mechanism of 
      vertical transmission.
PG  - 1074-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: It is currently unknown which mechanisms are responsible for TT virus 
      (TTV) infection in early childhood and whether it may be transmitted in utero from 
      mother to infant. METHODS: The prevalence, mode and extent of maternal TTV 
      transmission was investigated by testing blood, cord blood and breast milk samples 
      from mother-infant pairs for the existence of the novel DNA virus. RESULTS: By means 
      of polymerase chain reaction, TTV DNA was detected in 57 (41.3%) of 138 mothers and 
      in 19 (13.8%) of 138 cord blood samples; therefore 33.3% of infants are likely to be 
      infected by their mothers during the fetal period. Direct sequencing of TTV DNA from 
      2 mother-child pairs showed identical isolates. Follow-up sera from 3 TTV infected 
      babies showed persistence of viremia. In blood samples from newborns older than 1 
      week 9 (27.3%) of 33 sera were TTV-positive. Viral sequences were also detected in 2 
      of 2 breast milk samples. In none of the infected subjects were biochemical or 
      clinical signs of hepatitis observed. CONCLUSIONS: Our data prove that TT virus is 
      efficiently transmitted transplacentally. The increase of its prevalence in the 
      group of newborns older than 1 week suggests that it may be furthermore transmitted 
      postnatally. Therefore in our Caucasian population, vertical transmission, 
      particularly in utero transmission, of TTV is likely to account for a major part of 
      TTV infection in early childhood. However, no disease activity could be established 
      for the novel virus by this infection route.

TI  - Cloning and sequencing of complete TT virus genome from Beijing isolate of China.
PG  - 65-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain the complete TT virus genome from a Beijing isolate of China. 
      METHODS: PCR was performed for amplifying the TT virus genome from serum of a 
      patient with non A-G hepatitis. Five overlapped fragments, that are 199 bp (1-199), 
      1 267 bp (90-1356), 878 bp (1354-2231),1129 bp(2178-3306),'434 bp(3306-3739), 
      respectively, were obtained. These PCR products were sequenced by standard method. 
      RESULTS: The complete TT virus genome of Beijing isolate consists of 3 739 
      nucleotides involving two ORFs. The first ORF locates at 589-2902 nt, encoding 770 
      amino acids, the second ORF locates at 107-715 nt, encoding 202 amino acids. 5' and 
      3' terminus of the genome are non-coding regions including 106 bp and 837 bp 
      respectively. In this genome, A is 31.2%, C 25.4%, G 22.5% and T 20.9%. The homology 
      of Beijing isolate and Japanese TT virus was more than 95% at both nucleotide and 
      amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully cloned and sequenced the complete TT 
      virus genome from a Chinese patient. This Beijing TT virus isolate and that reported 
      by Japan all belong to a same genotype.

TI  - TT virus infection in children and adults who visited a general hospital in the 
      south of Brazil for routine procedure.
PG  - 519-22
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly described nonenveloped human virus, with a circular, 
      negative-stranded DNA genome, that was first identified in the blood of a patient 
      with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. PCR primers and conditions used 
      for TTV DNA amplification may greatly influence the level of TTV detection in serum. 
      Three PCR assays, with different regions of the genome as targets, were used to test 
      TTV DNA in 130 sera from children and adults visiting a hospital in the south of 
      Brazil, most of them for routine procedure. Forty-four percent of adult sera and 73% 
      of sera from children aged 0-10 years were TTV positive with at least one PCR assay. 
      However, the three assays were able to detect only 33%, 35%, and 70% of the total 
      positive samples. Our results showed a high prevalence of TTV infection in the south 
      of Brazil, particularly among young children, and confirmed the necessity of 
      performing several PCR assays to assess the true TTV prevalence in a determined 
      population.

TI  - Detection rates of TT virus DNA in serum of umbilical cord blood, breast milk and 
      saliva.
PG  - 203-7
AB  - To date, the routes of mother-to-infant transmission of TT virus (TTV) have not been 
      fully elucidated. The present study examines the detection rates of TTV DNA in the 
      serum of pregnant Japanese women and in cord blood at the time of delivery, as well 
      as in the saliva and breast milk of mothers one-month postpartum. Primers derived 
      from the well-known translated region N22 (N22 system), as well as the untranslated 
      region (UTR system) were used. The prevalence of TTV DNA in the serum of pregnant 
      women was found to be 11.9% (19/160) using the N22 system and 72.4% (55/76) using 
      the UTR system. No TTV DNA was detected in the cord blood samples (0/160) when the 
      N22 system was used for detection but TTV DNA was detected in 11.8% (7/76) of 
      samples studied with the UTR system. Using the N22 system, TTV DNA was not detected 
      in breast milk, but was detected in saliva. However using the UTR system, TTV DNA 
      was detected in both specimens. These results imply that some babies are vertically 
      infected with TTV via cord blood at the time of delivery or via breast milk or 
      saliva. However, further research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.

TI  - Polymerase chain reaction-based prevalence of hepatitis A, hepatitis E and TT 
      viruses in sewage from an endemic area.
PG  - 131-6
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV, HEV) are transmitted enterically 
      and are highly endemic in India. This study aims to evaluate prevalence of these and 
      TT virus (TTV) in the sewage. METHODS: Influent and effluent samples from a sewage 
      treatment plant from Pune, India were collected twice a week for 1 year and 
      subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of HAV RNA, 
      HEV RNA and TTV DNA. HAV and HEV PCR products were sequenced. Effluent samples were 
      not collected for 5 months as the plant was non-functional. RESULTS: The overall 
      prevalence was 24.42% (21/86, HAV), 10.98% (9/82, HEV) and 12.7% (8/63, TTV). 
      Prevalence of HAV was significantly higher than HEV (P=0.023). During summer months, 
      significantly higher HAV RNA positivity was noted (P<0.01). A substantial reduction 
      in HAV RNA positivity (15/48 vs. 2/48, P=0.0008) was recorded for treated sewage 
      samples. However, HEV RNA or TTV DNA positivity did not reduce significantly. Of the 
      17 HAV and HEV RNA negative sewage samples concentrated using ultracentrifugation, 
      13 and none were positive for HAV and HEV RNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses 
      grouped these viruses in IB and Ia, respectively, the genotypes most prevalent in 
      India. CONCLUSIONS: Sewage may play an important role in maintaining 
      hyper-endemicity of these infections. Sustained efforts are obligatory to render 
      sewage less/non-infectious.

TI  - [Cloning and sequence analysis of a novel TT virus varian].
PG  - 690-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone the DNA of a TT virus (TTV) variant isolated from a patient with 
      elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) of unknown etiology, and conduct sequence 
      analysis. METHODS: The long fragment of TTV DNA was amplified by nested PCR and then 
      cloned into pGEM-T vector. A clone named 56-B containing 3.2 kb TTV DNA was selected 
      for sequence analysis besides homology analysis with other 5 TTV variants retrieved 
      from GenBank, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out by maximum likelihood 
      method. RESULTS: The nucleotide identities of 56-B with the other 5 TTV strains 
      TA278, JA10, US35, SANBAN and TUS01 were 42.4%, 48.2%, 47.9%, 49.8 % and 61.7 % 
      respectively, and the corresponding amino acid identities were even lower. 
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that 56-B was far from other TTV strains in genetic 
      distance that ranged from 0.344 to 0.458. However, the sequences in the 5'- and 
      3'-end were still much conservative. CONCLUSION: The isolated 56-B showed high 
      heterogeneity in genetic background and was therefore quite distinct from other TTV 
      strains as a novel TTV variant that represents a new TTV genotype.

TI  - Prevalence and genetic variants of hepatitis GB-C/HG and TT viruses in Gabon, 
      equatorial Africa.
PG  - 192-8
AB  - The distribution of Hepatitis GB-C/HG (GB-C/HG) and TT viruses (TTV) infections was 
      investigated in selected populations from Gabon using Polymerase Chain Reaction 
      (PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for anti-Envelop 2 (anti-E2) 
      GBV-C/HGV antibodies. Among pregnant women, 29 of 229 (12.6%) were Hepatitis GB 
      virus-C and Hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) RNA positive (+) and 32 of 81 (39.5%) 
      anti-E2 + versus 8 of 39 (20.5%) TTV DNA +. Among sickle cell anemia patients, 9.7% 
      (3/31) were GBV-C/HGV RNA + versus 22.5% (7/31) TTV DNA +. For tuberculosis 
      patients, the figures were 11.5% (4/35) and 0%. A study of hepatocellular carcinoma 
      cases (n = 27) versus controls (n = 66) did not show significant differences for 
      GBV-C/HGV RNA (10.7% versus 12.1%) and TTV DNA (44.4% versus 30.3%). According to 
      phylogenetic analysis, the 15 GBV-C/HGV strains investigated clustered in group 1, 
      the most common in sub-Saharan Africa whereas TTV sequences (n = 4) mostly clustered 
      in genotypes G1 and one close to genotype G3. In the Gabonese populations 
      investigated, GBV-C/HGV and TTV infections were highly endemic. These data are 
      consistent with the low pathogenicity of these agents.

LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2010.01.019 [doi]
AB  - APOBEC3 proteins function as part of innate antiviral immunity and induce G to A 
      hypermutation in retroviruses and hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes. Whether APOBEC3 
      proteins affect viruses that replicate without a reverse transcription step is 
      unknown. TT virus (TTV), known to present in serum of healthy individuals and HBV 
      carriers, has a single-stranded circular DNA genome and replicates without reverse 
      transcription. In this study, we examined 67 blood samples obtained from healthy 
      individuals and HBV carriers and observed G to A hypermutation of genomes of TTV in 
      both healthy individuals and HBV carriers. During ALT flare-up in HBV carriers, G to 
      A hypermutation of HBV increased, but TTV genomes significantly decreased in number 
      and hypermutated TTV genomes became undetectable. Our results show that hypermutated 
      TTV exist in healthy individuals and HBV carriers and that TTV genomes were 
      susceptible to immune reaction directed to HBV by interacting with APOBEC3 proteins.

TI  - Investigation of HGV and TTV infection in sera and saliva from non-hepatitis 
      patients with oral diseases.
PG  - 857-62
AB  - AIM: To determine the frequencies of HGV and TTV infections in serum and saliva 
      samples of non-hepatitis patients with oral diseases in Hangzhou area, and to 
      understand the correlation between detected results of HGV RNA and/or TTV DNA in 
      sera and in saliva from the same patients. METHODS: RT-nested PCR for HGV RNA 
      detection and semi-nested PCR for TTV DNA detection were performed in the serum and 
      saliva samples from 226 non-hepatitis patients with oral diseases, and nucleotide 
      sequence analysis. RESULTS: Twenty-seven (11.9 %) and 21 (9.3 %) of the 226 serum 
      samples were only positive for HGV RNA and TTV DNA, respectively. 10 (4.4 %) and 9 
      (3.9 %) of the 226 saliva samples were only positive for HGV RNA and TTV DNA, 
      respectively. And 7 (3.1 %) of the serum samples and 2 (0.9 %) of the saliva samples 
      showed the positive amplification results for both HGV RNA and TTV DNA. 12 saliva 
      samples from the 34 patients (35.3 %) with HGV or HGV/TTV viremia and 11 saliva 
      samples from the 28 patients (39.3 %) with TTV or HGV/TTV viremia were HGV RNA 
      detectable, respectively, including two patients positive for both HGV RNA and TTV 
      DNA in serum and saliva samples. No saliva samples from the 226 patients were found 
      to be HGV RNA or TTV DNA detectable while their serum samples were negative for HGV 
      or TTV. Homologies of the nucleotide sequences of HGV and TTV amplification products 
      from the serum and saliva samples of the two patients compared with the reported 
      sequences were 88.65-91.49 % and 65.32-66.67 %, respectively. In comparison with the 
      nucleotide sequences of amplification products between serum and from saliva sample 
      from any one of the two patients, the homologies were 98.58 % and 99.29 % for HGV, 
      and were 98.65 % and 98.20 % for TTV, respectively. CONCLUSION: Relatively high 
      carrying rates of HGV and/or TTV in the sera of non-hepatitis patients with oral 
      diseases in Hangzhou area are demonstrated. Parts of the carriers are HGV and/or TTV 
      positive in their saliva. The results of this study indicate that dentists may be 
      one of the populations with high risk for HGV and/or TTV infection, and by way of 
      saliva HGV and TTV may be transmitted among individuals.

TI  - High frequencies of HGV and TTV infections in blood donors in Hangzhou.
PG  - 637-41
AB  - AIM: To determine the frequencies of HGV and TTV infections in blood donors in 
      Hangzhou. METHODS: RT-nested PCR for HGV RNA detection and semi-nested PCR for TTV 
      DNA detection in the sera from 203 blood donors, and nucleotide sequence analysis 
      were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-two (15.8%) and 30 (14.8%) of the 203 serum samples 
      were positive for HGV RNA and TTV DNA, respectively. And 5 (2.5%) of the 203 serum 
      samples were detectable for both HGV RNA and TTV DNA. Homology of the nucleotide 
      sequences of HGV RT-nested PCR products and TTV semi-nested PCR products from 3 
      serum samples compared with the reported HGV and TTV sequences was 89.36%, 87.94%, 
      88.65% and 63.51%, 65.77% and 67.12%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The infection rates 
      of HGV and/or TTV in blood donors are relatively high, and to establish HGV and TTV 
      examinations to screen blood donors is needed for transfusion security. The genomic 
      heterogeneity of TTV or HGV is present in the isolates from different areas.

      expressed protein.
PG  - 257-60
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To construct a recombinant expression vector containing TTV gene fragment 
      and identify the expressed protein. METHODS: Based on computer-aided studies, TTV 
      ORF12 gene fragment coding protein of antigenicity was amplified by PCR from the 
      patient serum with non-A-G hepatitis. Then the gene fragment was integrated into the 
      multiple cloning site of pQE-30 and expressed in E coil. The expressed protein was 
      identified by ELISA. RESULTS: The relative molecular weight of the expressed protein 
      matches the predication and its yield was up to 22.33% of total bacterial proteins 
      of E. coli The expressed protein was detected by ELISA. CONCLUSIONS: The recombinant 
      vector has been constructed successfully and the expressed protein possesses 
      antigenicity.

TI  - Seroepidemiology of TT virus infection and relationship between genotype and liver 
      damage.
PG  - 2214-20
AB  - TT virus (TTV) has been identified in patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of 
      unknown etiology and is thought to be a new hepatitis virus. We determined the 
      extent of TTV infection in the Japanese general population and the relationship 
      between TTV DNA genotype and liver damage. In 1998, we tested 847 serum samples for 
      TTV. TTV DNA was assayed by a nested polymerase chain reaction and classified into 
      three different genotypes and eight subtypes. TTV DNA was detected in 25.3% and 
      32.4% of the inhabitants of the two areas studied, respectively. The genotype 
      distribution was similar in both areas. G1, G2, and G3 were 60%, 20%, and 5%, 
      respectively. Of the 20 subjects with TTV DNA alone and elevated serum ALT levels, 
      18 were G1, one was G2, and one was G3. TTV infection is endemic in the Japanese 
      general population studied. The main TTV genotype, G1, may be related to the ensuing 
      liver damage.

PG  - 227-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the serological response between the special regions on the 
      Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) ORF1 coded protein and the porcine sera from 
      conventional pigs. METHODS: Based on a Chinese TTSuV2 strain from Guangdong 
      province, two overlapped virus proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli. Then, 
      purified recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins were used as the 
      antigens in the Western Blotting and ELISA assay. RESULTS: The recombinant TTSuV2 
      ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins were identified with the special tag monoclonal 
      antibody. The results of the ELISA tests shown that there were significant 
      relationships between two groups of dates from the recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and 
      TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins antigenic assay. The results of the following Western 
      Blotting assay indicated that the TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies were contained in 
      pig sera. CONCLUSION: The truncated TTSuV2 ORF1a protein (positions 168 to 346 
      corresponding to TTSuV2 GDIMA1) contains important B cell epitopes which can 
      stimulate immune system antibody secretion. The truncated TTSuV2 ORF1a protein could 
      be effective in TTSuV2 immunodiagnosis.

TI  - [Detection of TTV DNA in liver tissues of patients with non A-G hepatitis by in situ 
      hybridization].
PG  - 9-11
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the existence of TT virus(transfusion-transmitted virus, 
      TTV) in liver tissues of patients with unknown etiology. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded 
      liver tissues from 51 cases who were non A-E hepatitis serologically and 
      immunohistochemically negative for HBsAg, HCV NS3 antigen and HGV NS5 antigen were 
      tested by in situ hybridization with Dig TTV DNA probe. RESULTS: The total positive 
      rate of TTV DNA was 27.5% (14/51). Among the different pathological types, the 
      positive rates were 30.8% (4/13) in acute mild hepatitis, 12.5% (1/8) in acute 
      fulminante hepatitis, 42.9% (3/7) in subacute fulminante hepatitis, 33.3% (2/6) in 
      chronic hepatitis, 22.2% (2/9) in active liver cirrhosis, 25% (1/4) in chronic 
      fulminante hepatitis and 25% (1/4) in primary liver carcinoma respectively. 
      Hybridization signals were detected within the nuclei or cytoplasm of the hepatocyte 
      and most of them in nuclei. The positive cells were diffusely scattered in the 
      intralobular areas in acute hepatitis and aggregated in periportal areas in chronic 
      hepatitis or in the form of clustering in pseudolobules in active liver cirrhosis. 
      CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the TTV detected from liver tissues or sera 
      from patients with unknown etiology is a novel virus, which belongs to hepadnavirus.

TI  - [Detection of TTV DNA from high background nuclear acid samples using specific 
      nuclear acid captured-polymerase chain reaction].
PG  - 35-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the amplification of non-specificity of TTV DNA detection 
      using PCR from high background nuclear acids because of its low level in samples. 
      METHODS: Specific nuclear acid captured PCR(SNAC-PCR) was established through 
      capturing TTV DNA onto microplate with specific nuclear acid by means of 
      avidin-biotin system, then amplifying captured TTV DNA as usual. Its specificity was 
      evaluated by comparing with the detection of routine extraction samples using 
      nested-PCR with or without subsequent DNA sequencing in 10 samples of sera and liver 
      tissues in pairs. RESULTS: Positive results were obtained using routine protocol in 
      4 and 9 out of 10 samples of the sera and the liver tissues respectively. The PCR 
      products were proved to be specific using RFLP analysis with Kpn I. However, 
      positive results were found in only 2/10 and 3/10 of samples of sera and liver 
      tissue using DNA sequencing. The results of SNAC-PCR were the same as those of 
      routine protocol with subsequent DNA sequencing. Furthermore, sharper 
      electrophoresis bands were obtained. CONCLUSION: SNAC-PCR could dramatically 
      increase the specificity of the detection of TTV DNA, especially in high background 
      nuclear acid samples. It can be widely used in the detection of other pathogens with 
      low seral level or in high background nuclear acid samples. The level of TTV 
      infection might be over-evaluated by currently used TTV DNA detection when the PCR 
      products were not confirmed by DNA sequencing.

PG  - 226-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) 
      infection and analyze partial nucleotide sequence of TTV isolated from Guizhou area. 
      METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay with two-set of primers 
      deduced from the first read frame of TTV genome was established, the prevalence of 
      TTV DNA were detected in 395 sera collected from different population in Guizhou 
      area. The partial genes of TTV DNA fragments amplified from two liver disease 
      patients and one hemodialysis patient were analysed and then compared with gene from 
      Japan strain. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV DNA in 62 normal adults, 37 blood 
      donors, 50 hemodialysis patients, 107 intravenous drug users (IVDUs), 139 patients 
      with liver diseases were 6.45% (4/62), 8.10%(3/37), 26.00% (13/50), 25.23% (27/107) 
      and 16.54% (23/139), respectively. The homology of TTV DNA sequence was from 99% to 
      100% within three Guizhou strains. As compared with published sequence, the 
      nucleotide homology is 98% between all three Guizhou strains and Japan strain. 
      CONCLUSIONS: There are TT virus infection in Guizhou area, the infection rates were 
      higher in hemodialysis patients and IVDUs. The nucleotide homology was high between 
      Guizhou strain and Japan strain.

PG  - 987-92
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence of co-infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 
      novel hepatitis viruses GBV-C (Hepatitis G virus, HGV) and TT virus (TTV) in chronic 
      hepatitis C (HCV) infection has been studied. In patients with chronic hepatitis C 
      and in asymptomatic healthy HCV carriers, the influence of these agents on the 
      course of HCV infection was assessed. METHODS: a total of 110 HCV-positive 
      individuals, among them 77 patients with chronic hepatitis C--50 of them treated 
      with interferon (IFN)--and 33 HCV carriers with normal alanine aminotransferase have 
      been investigated. HBV-DNA, HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected by PCR, to determine 
      HBsAg and anti-HBc ELISA technic has been used. RESULTS: In the healthy population, 
      the prevalence of anti-HCV was 0.3%, HBsAg 0.09%, anti-HBc 2.5%, HGV RNA 8.0% and 
      TTV DNA 18.5%, respectively. In chronic hepatitis C HBsAg (accompanied with HBV-DNA) 
      occurred in 1.29%, anti-HBc 25.97%, HGV RNA in 9.09% and TTV DNA in 40.25% of cases. 
      In IFN-treated patients with sustained remission, the frequency of TTV was 20% vs. 
      45.7% found in non-responders. Among asymptomatic HCV-carriers, the prevalence of 
      anti-HBc was 27.27%, HGV RNA 9.09% and TTV DNA 75.7% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Neither previous HBV infection, nor HGV RNA and TTV DNA had apparent effect on the 
      course of chronic HCV infection. TTV was detected with the lowest frequency in 
      persons with sustained remission due to IFN, suggesting antiviral effect of IFN on 
      TTV.

TI  - Comparison of systems performance for TT virus detection using PCR primer sets 
      located in non-coding and coding regions of the viral genome.
PG  - 91-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: the heterogeneity of the TT virus (TTV) DNA prevalence values reported 
      from comparable human cohorts suggests that diagnostic PCR protocols still require 
      to be optimized. OBJECTIVES: to design TTV PCR primer sets with low genotype 
      restriction and to compare their performances with commonly used amplification 
      systems. STUDY DESIGN: we compared full length TTV genomic sequences and identified 
      conserved nucleotide patterns in the 5' and 3' non-coding regions of the viral 
      genome. This permitted to design two new primer sets usable for the PCR 
      amplification of the most divergent human isolates of TTV described to date. The 
      performances of these amplification systems were compared with those of three other 
      PCR systems earlier used for prevalence studies. RESULTS: the primer systems P5Bx 
      and P3Bx exhibited higher PCR scores than the other systems tested; 14 to 34% 
      improvement values were obtained, and divergent positive results of earlier 
      described PCR systems were confirmed systematically by our new detection assays. 
      CONCLUSIONS: an optimized detection of TT virus DNA is a pre-requisite for the 
      accurate epidemiological survey of viral infection and for the realization of 
      phylogenetic studies. Such PCR systems with low genotype restriction will be helpful 
      in the future for a better knowledge of natural history of TT virus infection.

TI  - [Genotypes of transfusion-transmitted virus].
PG  - 85-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genotypes of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) in 
      South China. METHODS: One capture probe for all types of TTV from the conserved 
      sequence nt2160 to nt2196 and six varied probes, heterogeneity more than 20% between 
      each other for G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 and G6 type, respectively were synthesized. The 
      primers coming from the conserved sequence of ORF1 were used to amplify TTV DNA from 
      the serums of patients. Microplate sandwich hybridization-ELISA technique was used 
      to detect the genotypes of TTV in 380 hepatitis patients with liver damage. RESULTS: 
      Sixty-one of 380 patients, about 16.0%, were TTV DNA positive, in whom 44 were 
      genotype I (G1), 5 were G2, 10 were mixed infection of G1 and G2, one was G3 and one 
      was G4. Neither G5 nor G6 has been detected. The rate of TTV infection in chronic 
      hepatitis patients was equal to that in acute hepatitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: TTV 
      infection is common in South China. There are four types of TTV. The first genotype 
      was G1, and the second was G2. G5 or G6 has not yet been detected. PCR microplate 
      sandwich hybridization-ELISA has certain value in clinic diagnosis for its specific, 
      sensitive and practicable characters.

TI  - Mother-to-child transmission of TT virus: sequence analysis of non-coding region of 
      TT virus in infected mother-infant pairs.
PG  - 803-12
AB  - To investigate vertical transmission of TT virus, TTV-DNA was looked for in serum 
      samples taken from 22 mothers and their 22 infants at birth and during nine months 
      of follow-up. Sixteen mothers at delivery and six infants within nine months of age 
      had TTV-DNA detected by the amplification of the non coding (NC) region. Two of 
      these newborns had positive viremia at birth. Sequence analysis of the NC region of 
      five mother-infant pairs revealed that the TTV strains detected at three and six 
      months of age in two of the infants were closely related to that of their mothers, 
      whereas two that became TTV-DNA positive at three moths had a different nucleotide 
      sequence from that of their mothers. One of the two infants with detectable viremia 
      at birth also had a different nucleotide sequence from her mother. These findings 
      suggest that both in utero and perinatal transmission of TT virus may occur, and 
      that the strain detected in the infants was not invariably dominant in the mothers 
      at delivery.

TI  - Prevalence and clinical significance of SEN virus infection in patients with non A-E 
      hepatitis and volunteer blood donors in Shanghai.
PG  - 4204-8
AB  - AIM: To explore the prevalence of SEN virus (SENV) in patients with non A-E 
      hepatitis and volunteer blood donors in Shanghai. METHODS: According to the 
      published gene sequences, primers from the conserved region were designed. Then, the 
      prevalence of SEN virus in 30 samples from healthy voluntary blood donors and 30 
      samples from patients with non A-E hepatitis were detected by nested-PCR of 
      SENV-D/H. Some PCR products were cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: The specificity of 
      genotype-specific PCR was confirmed by sequencing, the SENV DNA was detected in 
      53.3% of the patients with non A-E hepatitis and 10% of the blood donors. The 
      prevalence of SENV-D/H viremia was significantly higher in patients with non A-E 
      hepatitis than in blood donors (P = 0.0002). SENV-H subtype and SENV-D subtype were 
      found in 2 and 1 samples, respectively from blood donors. SENV-H subtype, SENV D 
      subtype, mixed SENV-D and SENV-H subtype were found in 8, 6 and 2 samples, 
      respectively, from patients with non A-E hepatitis. CONCLUSION: The gene type of 
      SENV in patients with non A-E hepatitis and blood donors in shanghai is D or H 
      subtype, and transfusion is not the only transmitting form of SENV.

TI  - High prevalence of TT virus-related DNA (90%) and diverse viral genotypes in 
      Norwegian blood donors.
PG  - 381-6
AB  - Early estimates of the prevalence of TTV viremia in healthy adults of developed 
      countries were in the order of 1--10 %, while similar estimates in Third World 
      countries were considerably higher. Using three different PCRs, TTV-related DNA was 
      detected in serum from 180 out of the 201 Norwegian blood donors tested, indicating 
      that these viruses are almost universally present in adults. Sequence analysis 
      revealed heterogeneity similar to what is found world-wide. The data suggest that 
      the previous discrepancy in prevalences might be related to a lower serum 
      concentration of virus in developed countries. The high prevalence adds evidence to 
      the benign nature of the virus.

TI  - Prevalence of TT virus in healthy children and thalassemic pediatric and young adult 
      patients.
PG  - 629-32
AB  - BACKGROUND: The recently discovered TT virus (TTV) has been shown to be highly 
      prevalent in patients with cryptogenetic chronic liver disease and fulminant 
      hepatitis. To study the frequency of TTV and to evaluate the possible association 
      with liver disease, 37 pediatric and young adult patients with thalassemia, and 36 
      healthy children were included in the study. The sera of 100 blood donors selected 
      randomly in the same period were also tested for TTV DNA. METHODS: The TTV 
      amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using a first set of 
      primers that recognize an internal sequence into N22 and a second set of primers 
      amplifying a sequence within 5;NCR (5; noncoding region). RESULTS: The first set of 
      primers revealed TTV DNA in 73% of thalassemic patients, in 8% of healthy children, 
      and in 5% of healthy blood donors. With the second set of primers, the prevalence of 
      TTV DNA was, respectively, 100% in thalassemic patients, 44.5% in healthy pediatric 
      patients, and 87% in healthy blood donors. All individuals who tested positive for 
      TTV by the first set of primers were also positive by the second primer set. The TTV 
      infection seemed not to be the cause of altered transaminase levels. Sequencing of 
      TTV clones from thalassemic patients showed the presence of different TTV variants 
      in the same serum. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TTV in polytransfused children is 
      similar to that detected in blood donors. Moreover, TTV can be detected in healthy 
      children of all ages. The presence of TTV seems to have no clinical significance.

TI  - Transmission of human TT virus of genotype 1a to chimpanzees with fecal supernatant 
      or serum from patients with acute TTV infection.
PG  - 470-6
AB  - Fecal supernatant or serum containing TT virus (TTV) of genotype 1a (10(5) 
      copies/ml) from patients with acute TTV infection was inoculated intravenously into 
      two naive chimpanzees. Serum samples were obtained weekly and tested for TTV DNA by 
      genotype 1-specific polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in chimpanzee 
      228 at weeks 5-15 after inoculation with 0.5 ml of serum, and in chimpanzee 234 at 
      weeks 7-19 after inoculation with 1 ml of fecal supernatant. The TTV DNA titer 
      peaked at weeks 12 and 13 in chimpanzee 228 and at weeks 14-16 in chimpanzee 234. 
      Mild biochemical and histological changes in biopsied liver samples were observed in 
      both chimpanzees in association with the reduction in TTV titer. TTV DNA was 
      transient in chimpanzee 228, but in chimpanzee 234 it reappeared at week 21 and 
      persisted through week 30. These results indicate that TTV in feces is infectious 
      and suggest that TTV has hepatitis-inducing capacity.

TI  - Full-length nucleotide sequence of a simian TT virus isolate obtained from a 
      chimpanzee: evidence for a new TT virus-like species.
PG  - 330-5
AB  - Recently, we identified TT virus (TTV) isolates from nonhuman primates and named 
      them simian TTV (s-TTV). To characterize the genomic structure of these isolates in 
      more detail, the full-length nucleotide sequence of the s-TTV isolate (designated 
      s-TTV CH65-1), recovered from a chimpanzee born in West Africa, was amplified by 
      nested PCR with inverted primers deduced from the untranslated region of s-TTV DNA. 
      CH65-1 was composed of 3899 nucleotides (nt) and had two open reading frames (ORF) 
      spanning 2295 nt (ORF1) and 402 nt (ORF2). The sequence had only 52.3% similarity to 
      the prototype TA278 human isolate. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that CH65-1 
      was distinct from the human TTV isolates. These results suggested that s-TTV may 
      represent a new TTV-like viral species or genus.

TI  - TT virus infection in Japanese children: isolates from genotype 1 are 
      overrepresented in patients with hepatic dysfunction of unknown etiology.
PG  - 233-9
AB  - The pathogenecity of the TT virus (TTV) especially during childhood remains obscure. 
      We investigated the prevalence of TTV in 40 patients with non-A to C hepatic 
      dysfunction (non-A to C hepatic dysfunction group). Five patients with fulminant 
      hepatitis of unknown etiology were enrolled in this group. We also examined 380 
      children without a history of transfusion or liver disease (control group). 
      Subsequently, the genotypes of TTV strains isolated were analyzed in terms of their 
      nucleotide sequences including 222 bp in the open reading frame 1 region. The 
      prevalence of serum TTV DNA was 10/40 (25%) in the non-A to C hepatic dysfunction 
      group and 25/380 (7%) in the control group. Sixty-six percent (23/35) of all 
      examined cases exhibited either genotype 1 or 2. However, assessment of genotype in 
      the non-A to C hepatic dysfunction group (10 cases) revealed a higher prevalence of 
      genotype 1 than of all other genotypes (80% vs. 20%). This result differed 
      significantly from that of the control group (25 cases; 32% vs. 68%). Such 
      overrepresentation of genotype 1 suggests that this type of TTV strain is associated 
      with the development of hepatic dysfunction of unknown etiology in Japanese 
      children.

TI  - Prevalence of a novel DNA virus (TTV) among patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 139-42
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: A recently detected DNA virus (TTV) has been assumed to be 
      responsible for posttransfusion hepatitis in humans. Until now it is unclear whether 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis are at increased risk of acquiring TTV. 
      METHODS: Serum samples derived from 143 chronically hemodialyzed patients were 
      examined for TTV viremia by nested PCR. All serum specimens were also investigated 
      for viremia and for the presence of antibodies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and GB 
      virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) by PCR and serological assays, respectively. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV was determined to be 18.8% (n = 27), for HCV a 
      prevalence of 15.4% (n = 22) and for GBV-C/HGV of 8.4% (n = 12) could be 
      demonstrated. Parallel infection by TTV and HCV was detected in only 1.4% (n = 2) of 
      the patients. In no serum sample could TTV and GBV-C/HGV be detected in parallel. 
      None of the solely TTV-viremic individuals had clinical or biochemical signs of 
      liver disease. CONCLUSION: From our data we conclude that TTV viremia is widespread 
      among hemodialysis patients and can be detected in 18.8%. Since no viremic patient 
      had clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease, the hepatitis-inducing capacity 
      of TTV remains unclear.

TI  - Lack of association between hepatotropic transfusion transmitted virus infection and 
      oral lichen planus in British and Italian populations.
PG  - 990-3
AB  - BACKGROUND: A possible association between oral lichen planus (OLP) and chronic 
      hepatic disease has been found in some populations, although this is probably 
      geographically influenced. In 1997 a new hepatotropic virus, transfusion transmitted 
      virus (TTV), was identified but has not been studied in relation to OLP. OBJECTIVE: 
      The present investigation evaluated the genoprevalence of TTV DNA in the sera of 
      British and Italian patients suffering from OLP using two different sets of primers 
      to identify TTV subgenomic DNA. METHODS: Study groups comprised 40 adult subjects 
      (21 British, 19 Italian) with OLP. For each country, two control groups, a 
      disease-control group and a healthy-control group, were included. The presence of 
      TTV DNA in the sera of patients and control subjects was assessed using two 
      different polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis. RESULTS: 
      Statistical analysis did not reveal evidence of any association between TTV 
      infection and OLP or country of residence. CONCLUSION: An association between TTV 
      and OLP is unlikely.

TI  - [Significance of detection of transfusion transmitted virus in extrahepatic 
      tissues].
PG  - 92-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the location and distribution of transfusion transmitted 
      virus (TTV) in the liver and extrahepatic tissues. METHODS: TTV DNA was detected in 
      paraffin-embedded autopsy liver and extrahepatic tissues, including liver, pancreas, 
      kidney, spleen, testicle, and heart from 13 patients with non A-G hepatitis by 
      nested-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. RESULTS: Positive 
      hybridization signals of TTV nucleus acid were observed in 5 liver, 3 kidney, 2 
      pancreas and spleen tissues, respectively. TTV DNA was detected in one from each two 
      samples of testicle and heart. Positive signal was mainly located in nucleoli of the 
      liver and extrahepatic parenchymal cells. There was not obvious pathological damage 
      in those extrahepatic tissues. The positive rate of PCR approximately corresponded 
      to ISH. CONCLUSIONS: TTV can infect hepatic and extrahepatic tissues and its 
      infection in extrahepatic tissues might be responsible for a state of reinfection 
      and higher prevalence in different population.

TI  - SEN virus infection in children in Taiwan: transmission route and role in blood 
      transfusion and liver diseases.
PG  - 390-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: SEN virus (SENV) is a newly discovered DNA virus. We conducted this 
      study to evaluate potential modes of SENV transmission and the pathogenic effect of 
      SENV on liver diseases in children. METHODS: Polymerase chain reaction was used to 
      detect 2 SENV variant (SENV-D and SENV-H) DNA in sera from healthy individuals and 
      diseased children. Nucleotide sequence of SENV was determined by direct sequencing. 
      RESULTS: SENV infection was assessed in healthy individuals, including 50 newborns 
      (sera collected from the umbilical cord), 24 infants, 46 preschool children (aged 
      1-6 years), 42 school children of an age before that of the first sexual experience 
      (aged 7-12 years), 62 adolescents (13-18 years), 72 young adults (19-30 years) and 
      32 adults (>30 years). The prevalence of SENV-D and/or SENV-H (SENV-D/H) viremia in 
      each group was 0%, 17%, 24%, 24%, 27%, 33% and 40%, respectively. The prevalence of 
      SENV-D/H viremia in 18 children with non-A to E hepatitis, 64 thalassemic children, 
      80 children transfused during cardiac surgery, 30 children with chronic hepatitis B, 
      9 children with chronic hepatitis C and 32 infants with biliary atresia was 11%, 
      61%, 80%, 83%, 67% and 50%, respectively. SENV was found more frequently in all 
      patient groups than in 174 age-matched controls (P < 0.01), with the exception of 
      non-A to E hepatitis (11% versus 24% in the control group; P = 0.27). In 2 infants 
      with proven intrauterine hepatitis B viral infection, identical SENV-D nucleotide 
      sequence existed in both the maternal and neonate serum. Elevated alanine 
      aminotransferase concentrations were rarely observed in children who acquired 
      isolated SENV viremia because of transfusion for surgery. Infection with SENV in 
      children with chronic hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B viral infection was not 
      associated with higher peak alanine aminotransferase values. CONCLUSION: SENV is 
      transmitted mainly via nonparenteral daily contact and frequently occurs early in 
      life. Transfusion can significantly increase the rate of SENV viremia. SENV does not 
      appear to cause hepatitis in children.

TI  - Prevalence and clinical significance of SEN virus infection among volunteer blood 
      donors in southern Taiwan.
PG  - 1181-5
AB  - Of the eight different isolates of SEN virus (SENV), SENV-D and SENV-H have been 
      suggested associated with transfusion-associated hepatitis. The prevalence and 
      clinical significance of these two SENV strains among blood donors in southern 
      Taiwan were investigated in this study. Sera of 223 blood donors who were negative 
      for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and third-generation HCV antibody 
      (anti-HCV) from a blood center of southern Taiwan were tested for alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT), GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) anti-envelope 
      protein 2 (anti-E2) antibody and RNA, and SENV-D and -H DNA. Of the 223 donors, the 
      prevalence of SENV-D and/or -H (SENV-D/H), SENV-D, SENV-H DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA, and 
      anti-E2 were 24.2, 19.7, 5.8, 2.2, and 8.5%. The donors with SENV-D DNA had a 
      significantly higher mean age than those without (31.2 +/- 10.9 vs. 27.5 +/- 8.3 
      years; P = 0.014). No association between positive SENV DNA and gender, GBV-C/HGV 
      exposure, mean ALT level, or abnormal ALT was found. Based on multiple logistic 
      regression analysis, the increased age was the only independent factor associated 
      with positive SENV-D DNA (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08). 
      Nearly a fourth of blood donors in southern Taiwan were infected by SENV-D/H, with 
      SENV-D more prevalent than SENV-H. Patients with higher ages have a higher 
      prevalence of SENV-D. SENV-D or SENV-H infection was not associated with ALT levels.

TI  - Quantitative and genotypic analysis of TT virus infection in Chinese blood donors.
PG  - 1001-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The TT virus (TTV) is a member of a newly described family of human 
      viruses related to the C ircoviridae viruses. Its association with specific diseases 
      has not been established, and screening of blood donors has not been implemented. To 
      date, 16 genotypes have been identified. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Sera from 471 
      healthy blood donors (aged 11-58 years) were randomly selected and tested for TTV by 
      the use of two sets of primers: NG59d/NG61d/NG63d primers and T801/T935 primers. 
      Quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR) was developed to measure the TTV DNA 
      concentration among the blood donors. Sequencing of a part of the genome was 
      performed to identify the various genotypes. Several samples showed a mixed genotype 
      infection. RESULTS: TTV was detected in 251 (53.3%) of 471 healthy Hong Kong blood 
      donors by the use of NG59d/NG61d/NG63d primers. The prevalence of the virus 
      increased steadily with age (p = 0.03). TTV DNA was detected in 90 percent (90 of a 
      randomly selected 100) of samples by the use of T801/T935 primers. TTV DNA 
      concentration was also measured by QC-PCR in the blood donors who were positive for 
      TTV DNA in the first round of the heminested PCR. TTV titers ranged from 4.8 x 10(2) 
      copies per mL to 6 x 10(4) copies per mL, with a median value of 1.2 x 10(4) copies 
      per mL. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a 223-bp fragment from open reading 
      frame 1 showed three main genotypes (G1 [60.7%], G2 [24.3%], and G3 [14%]) and a new 
      genotype 17 (G17), with the latter bearing 60-percent nucleotide homology with other 
      genotypes deposited at GenBank. In addition, a new TTV subtype, G2f, was found. 
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TTV is high in healthy Chinese blood donors. Three 
      main genotypes (G1, G2, and G3) were detected. In addition, a new TTV genotype, 
      tentatively designated as G17, and a new subtype, G2f, were identified.

TI  - Molecular epidemiology of TT virus in Italy and phylogenesis of viral isolates from 
      subjects at different risk for parenteral exposure.
PG  - 76-84
AB  - The prevalence and genotype distribution of human TT virus (TTV) in Italy were 
      analysed in 593 subjects at different risk of parenteral infection who included 
      blood donors, patients with chronic type C hepatitis (HCV), thalassemic patients, 
      patients on haemodialysis, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-negative 
      intravenous drug users (IVDUs), and HIV-1-infected subjects (IVDUs, heterosexual 
      contacts and homosexual males). Plasma TTV-DNA was detected using nested PCR with 
      primers deduced from the N22 region of the open reading frame 1 (ORF-1) and from the 
      untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the 
      sequences obtained from ORF-1 was also undertaken. A high prevalence of plasma 
      TTV-DNA was observed using the UTR primers, with rates varying from 83-100% in the 
      study groups. Using the N22 primers, HIV-1 positive IVDUs and homosexual males, 
      haemodialysed patients and thalassemic patients had a significantly higher TTV 
      prevalence (range: 23.0-86.1%) than blood donors, who displayed a high frequency of 
      positivity (10.6%). Sequence analysis of 127 N22-positive isolates revealed that 
      42.5% were of type 1, 53.5% of type 2, 2.4% of type 3, and that two isolates (1.6%) 
      were closely related to genotypes 1-2 but distinct from the other major genotypes. 
      TTV-2 was significantly more prevalent in patients at high risk for parenteral 
      infection and in HIV-1 positive homosexuals. In sequential samples from 15 
      TTV-infected subjects, N22 sequences were detectable persistently in 12 (80.0%) and 
      UTR sequences persisted in all 15 patients over a mean period of 29.6 months. This 
      data indicates that TTV is widespread in Italy in parenterally exposed subjects, and 
      that the infection frequently persists.

TI  - [Presence and replication of TTV DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 
      hepatitis patients with TTV infection].
PG  - 16-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the presence and replication of TTV DNA in the peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hepatitis patients with TTV infection. METHODS: 
      Nested-PCR (nPCR) was performed for detecting the TTV DNA from the sera, PBMCs and 
      feces of 16 patients with non-A to non-G hepatitis in Beijing Ditan Hospital from 
      Oct. 1997 to Oct. 1998. PBMC DNAs were aslo digested by mung bean nuclease and 
      amplified by nPCR to clasify if TTV DNA was still positive. nPCR products of the 
      sera, PBMCs and feces of 5 hepatitis patients with non-A to non-G hepatitis were 
      cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: 14 of the 16 samples of PBMC and 5 of the 16 samples 
      of the feces were TTV DNA positive. Two of the 14 samples of the PBMC were still 
      positive after the digestion and amplification of the single-stand DNA. Sequence 
      analysis showed that there was more than 95% nucleotide homology among the sequenced 
      5 clones (from the sera, PBMC and feces of the 5 patients) and reported AB008394 
      (from Japan) and AF079173 (from China). Virus loading of patients whose feces were 
      positive by nPCR was obviously more than the patients with negative TTV DNA. 
      CONCLUSION: TTV DNA can exist and replicate in the PBMC; the hepatocytes of patients 
      with TTV infection are not the only place of TTV existence and replication.

TI  - Novel TTV variants isolated in an epidemic of hepatitis of unknown etiology.
PG  - 113-7
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered single-stranded DNA virus that has been 
      reported to be associated with elevated transminase levels in the patients with 
      posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. TTV prevalence is very high in the 
      common population and its pathogenicity remains unclear. In this study, we performed 
      an epidemiological study to investigate the infection rate of TTV and its role in an 
      epidemic of unknown-etiology hepatitis. Moreover, two TTV isolates named L01 and L02 
      were cloned from the serum of a patient with unknown-etiology hepatitis. Eighty-one 
      subjects were included in the study and were divided into two groups: 18 in the case 
      group and 63 in the control group. TTVDNA was detected by nested PCR from sera 
      samples. The infection rates of TTV in case and control groups were 33.3 and 38.9%, 
      respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Homology 
      analysis showed that L01 had a very poor homology with other TTV isolates and L02, 
      and L02 was 75.5% identical to JA10. The result does not support TTV as a causative 
      agent in this epidemic. The genetic divergence between L01 and other TTV isolates 
      beyond genotype, so it represents a new genotype of TTV.

TI  - [Investigation of SEN virus genotypes D and H among blood donors in Mersin 
      University Medical School Hospital].
PG  - 39-45
AB  - SEN virus is a recently discovered DNA virus, and eight genotypes (A to H) were 
      detected by phylogenetic analysis. Genotype D (SENV-D) and H (SENV-H) are thought to 
      be associated in the etiology of post-transfusion hepatitis. Although no strong 
      association was revealed between liver pathology and SEN virus, the viral 
      replication in hepatocytes and transmission by blood transfusions were well 
      characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SENV-D and 
      SENV-H in blood donors. One hundred serum samples were included in the study which 
      were obtained from blood donors comprised of 98 male and 2 female with a mean age 
      36.4 years who were enrolled at Mersin University Faculty of Medicine blood center. 
      The DNAs of SENV-D and SENV-H were detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), by 
      using D10S/L2AS and C5S/L2AS primers, respectively. SEN virus DNA positivity was 
      detected in 25 of 100 (25%) sera, of which 10 (10%) were positive for SENV-D and 15 
      (15%) were positive for SENV-H DNA. Although, the number of samples were not 
      sufficient to reflect the general prevalence, our study relatively reveals that 
      asymptomatic carriage rate of these viruses were 25% in our province.

TI  - Genotypic distribution of TT virus (TTV) in a Czech population: evidence for sexual 
      transmission of the virus.
PG  - 31-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: TTV is a new DNA virus distinguished by its high degree of strain 
      heterogeneity. The geographic clustering of viral genotypes suggests frequent 
      community transmission. While no specific human disease has yet been linked to it, a 
      transmission mechanism that facilitates strain diversity may eventually select for a 
      strain that will become pathogenic. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to examine 
      the prevalence, genotypic distribution, and mode of transmission of TTV in detail. 
      STUDY DESIGN: Three groups of study subjects were recruited between October 1998 and 
      January 2000 in Prague, Czech Republic. Group 1 included 152 injection drug users 
      with liver disease; group 2 included 102 persons with liver disease who denied ever 
      using injection drugs; group 3 included 111 prospective blood donors. TTV DNA was 
      detected from blood by a semi-nested PCR assay, and a selected set of PCR products 
      was genotyped by direct sequencing. Factors associated with TTV prevalence in groups 
      1 and 2 subjects were compared. RESULTS: TTV was detected in 15.8, 13.7, and 13.5% 
      of Groups 1, 2, and 3 subjects, respectively (P>0.05). The most common genotype was 
      2 (54%), followed by 1 (13%). The prevalence of TTV viremia was nearly three times 
      higher in persons with a present or past history of hepatitis B compared to those 
      without (P<0.05). TTV prevalence increased proportionately with the number of 
      lifetime sex partners in both groups (P<0.05); it was highest (32%) among non-users 
      of injection drugs who had five or more lifetime sex partners. CONCLUSION: TTV 
      prevalence in the Czech population is similar among blood donors, persons with liver 
      disease, as well as in a high-risk population of injection drug users. TTV appears 
      to be sexually transmitted.

TI  - [TTV and HPV co-infection in cervical smears of patients with cervical lesions in 
      littoral of Zhejiang province].
PG  - 110-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) and 
      human papillomavirus (HPV) co-infection in cervical smears of patients with cervical 
      lesions in littoral of Zhejiang province and analysis of transmitted route. METHODS: 
      Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) was established. TTV DNA were tested by nPCR 
      in cervical smears of 95 patients with cervical lesions and 55 healthy women, paired 
      serum samples were available from 55 and 42 women, and their viral titer. The 
      genotypes of 95 specimens of cervical cytology were detected with HybriMax. The 
      phylogenetic group of TTV was determined by means of nPCR with N22 primers. RESULTS: 
      The prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears of patients with cervical lesions and 
      healthy women was 52.7% (29/55) and was comparable with that in paired serum sample 
      (50%). Symptomatic women had significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical 
      smears (74.7%) than healthy controls (P = 0.005). The TTV DNA prevalence in patient 
      serum samples was 51%. The phylogenetic groups of TTV serum isolates were concordant 
      with those of TTV from cervical smears of the same subjects, and genotype was G1b. 
      The TTV viral titer in cervical smears were 10 to 1000 times as high as in serum. 
      The total infection rate of HPV was 98.9% in patients, and was 27.3% in healthy 
      women. The frequently detected genotype was HPV16, 18, 33 of HSIL, and HPV6 of LSIL. 
      The HPV positive study subjects had significantly higher TTV DNA prevalence than HPV 
      negatives (P = 0.02). CONCLUSION: High prevalence of TTV in cervical smears suggests 
      that sexual transmission is another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the 
      population. The higher viral titer in cervical smears than in the respective serum 
      samples might indicate active TTV replication in the female genital tract. 
      Nevertheless, cooperation between TTV and HPV needs to be further investigated.

TI  - Pathological changes of renal epithelial cells in mice transgenic for the TT virus 
      ORF1 gene.
PG  - 141-150
LID - 10.1099/0022-1317-83-1-141 [doi]
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified human DNA virus of the family Circoviridae. Its 
      genome consists of six putative open reading frames (ORFs). TTV was isolated 
      originally from a patient with cryptogenic hepatitis and the association of TTV with 
      hepatitis has been studied extensively, while its significance in other diseases is 
      unknown. To examine the pathogenicity of TTV, mice transgenic for the ORF genes in 
      various combinations were produced. A total of 11 independent founder mice was 
      produced: two mice, which were found to carry the ORF1 gene, showed pathological 
      changes in the kidney; other tissues were not affected. In these mice, the transgene 
      was expressed most strongly in the kidney and the transcript was shown to be spliced 
      to encode a protamine-like, highly basic protein. Mice from a line with high 
      transgene expression developed renal failure with severe renal epithelial cell 
      abnormalities resembling those seen in humans with nephrotic syndrome. The 
      transgenic mice with severe ascites died before reaching the age of 5 weeks. Another 
      founder mouse with low expression levels also showed similar, but milder, renal 
      epithelial cell changes, indicating that these effects were not caused by the 
      insertion of the transgene, but, rather, were caused by the ORF1 gene product. These 
      observations suggest that TTV affects renal epithelial cells as part of the 
      naturally occurring infection.

TI  - Roles of TT virus infection in various types of chronic hepatitis.
PG  - 219-23
AB  - An unenveloped single-stranded virus, which might be a causative agent for 
      posttransfusion non-A-G hepatitis, was recently found and named "TT virus" (TTV). 
      There is still controversy over the role of TTV in chronic hepatitis. Therefore, we 
      have examined the prevalence of TTV in various types of chronic hepatitis in Japan. 
      TTV DNA was detected in 11 of 40 patients (27.5%) with non-B, non-C chronic 
      hepatitis, 13 of 46 patients (28.3%) with type B chronic hepatitis, 21 of 55 
      patients (38.2%) with type C chronic hepatitis, and 41 of 131 subjects (31.3%) with 
      normal liver function tests. The positivity rate for TTV DNA tended to increase with 
      age. The detection rate did not differ statistically between non-B, non-C chronic 
      hepatitis and type B or type C chronic hepatitis, or normal subjects. The 
      distribution of TTV genotypes was not significantly different among them. Clinical 
      characteristics of the chronic illness were similar for patients with or without TTV 
      in all hepatitis groups. The etiologic role of TTV in chronic hepatitis is not 
      confirmed from the statistical and clinical standpoint.

TI  - Detection of TT virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction-microplate hybridization.
PG  - 85-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for the detection of TT virus (TTV) DNA by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-microplate hybridization and to find out various 
      influential factors of the assay. METHODS: TTV DNA extracted by guanidinium 
      thiocyanate was amplified by PCR, the PCR primers were pre-labeled with biotin. By 
      conjugation of biotin with streptavidin, the amplified products were coated to the 
      microplate well, and hybridized with FITC- probe simultaneously. After being reacted 
      with Anti-Fluorescein POD, the products that contained FITC probe were coloured by 
      TMB-H2O2 and then measured the optical density using a microplate reader at 450 nm 
      wavelength. RESULTS: The optimal concentration of NaOH was 0.3 mol/L, and the 
      optimal time of hybridization and enzymatic reaction was 60 minutes and 45 minutes, 
      respectively. The results also showed that the positive rate of TTV infection in 
      normal population, hepatitis A-G and hepatitis non A-G was 13.6%, 20.3% and 28.1%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the PCR-microplate hybridization with the 
      electrophoresis assay, the former is simple, rapid, sensitive and specific and is 
      expected to be a new technique instead of electrophoresis assay as a routine method 
      for TTV DNA detection.

      paraffin].
PG  - 112-7
AB  - INTRODUCTION: TT virus has been recently isolated in Japan in patients with acute 
      and chronic non-A/non-G hepatitis. Its possible etiopathogenetic role in causing 
      hepatitis has been initially taken in consideration. On the contrary, more recent 
      studies deny the importance of TT virus in causing liver damage. Most of the studies 
      are based on serological data or on viral detection from frozen liver tissue. AIM OF 
      THE STUDY: In the present paper we describe a method to detect viral genome from 
      formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded liver tissue. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twelve 
      needle biopsies from liver were studied. Six cases were selected on the basis of 
      serological negativity for HBV and HCV markers. Five cases of HCV-related chronic 
      hepatitis and one HCV- and HIV-positive intravenous drug abuser were also included. 
      All patients underwent liver biopsy, performed with a 14-G needle. Liver specimens 
      were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as routine. From each block, sections were 
      cut and stained for histopathologic examination. Additional 5 microns sections were 
      employed to extract DNA for nested PCR. RESULTS: In 2 of 12 cases studied, TT virus 
      genome was found. In both cases the presence of viral DNA was confirmed by 
      sequencing. Both patients were male. The first patient was a 39-year-old HIV- and 
      HCV-positive intravenous drug abuser. The second patient was a 60-year-old heavy 
      alcohol drinker. In both cases the presence of TT virus apparently did not affect 
      the histological picture. CONCLUSION: It is possible to detect TT virus genome from 
      formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. This method offers the possibility to 
      perform retrospective studies.

TI  - Correlation between Torque tenovirus infection and serum levels of eosinophil 
      cationic protein in children hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases.
PG  - 971-4
AB  - Children with bronchopneumonia have considerably higher Torque tenovirus (TTV) loads 
      than do children with milder acute respiratory diseases (ARDs). Moreover, in 
      children with ARDs, high TTV loads correlate with low percentages of circulating 
      CD3+ and CD4+ T cells and with elevated percentages of B cells, suggesting that TTV 
      might be immunomodulatory. Here, we show that, in children with ARDs, the presence 
      of TTV and TTV load correlate with concentrations of serum eosinophil cationic 
      protein. The possible mechanisms whereby TTV infection might lead to augmented 
      activity of eosinophils and the implications for pathogenesis are discussed.

TI  - [Analysis of eleven isolated transfusion transmitted virus genotype].
PG  - 89-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) genotype in hepatitis 
      patients and healthy people. METHODS: DNA fragment of TTV was amplified by 
      polymerase chain reaction with nested primers in eight patients with liver disease 
      and three healthy persons. The nested PCR products were cloned and sequenced. 
      RESULTS: A TTV DNA sequence of 222 bp (primer sequence excluded) was compared among 
      the 11 subjects. The similarity between N22 and WH1, WH2, WH3, GZ1, GZ2, GZ3, SD2, 
      SD3 was 97.0%, 97.0%, 98.0%, 98.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, 94.6% and 95.5%, respectively. The 
      similarity between TXO11 and GZ4, SD1, XJ1 was 98.0%, 98.0% and 95.0%, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: According to Okamoto's method, the eleven TTV clones are classified into 
      two subtypes: genotype 1a and 1b.

      Province.
PG  - 166-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular epidemiology of transfusion transmitted virus 
      (TTV) infection and its distribution in different populations in Shanxi Province and 
      the gene types of the isolates. METHODS: TTV DNA in serum samples was detected by 
      polymerase chain reaction. Partial gene of the strains from different populations 
      were cloned and sequenced, and their gene types were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 24 cases 
      with chronic hepatitis B, 31 cases with non A-G hepatitis, 53 cases of professional 
      blood donors, 112 cases of healthy lying -in women, the positive rates of TTV DNA 
      were 41.66%, 29.03%, 58.49% and 8.93%, respectively. TTV DNA in serum samples of 18 
      cases of 2 - 3 years old healthy children were negative and also were negative in 
      umbilical cord blood of 10 cases of TTV DNA positive healthy lying-in woman. 
      Sequence analysis of 4 isolated strains of Shanxi Province showed that the 
      nucleotide identity among them were more than 90% and they all belonged to the same 
      gene type (la) CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that TTV infection existed in Shanxi 
      Province, TTV might be an important pathogen for non-A to G hepatitis. TTV often 
      coinfected with hepatitis B virus and there were high rates of TTV infection in 
      professional blood donors and in patients with chronic liver disease. The gene type 
      of TTV in Shanxi province was la.

TI  - [Detection of TT virus DNA by nested-PCR method in non A-E hepatitis cases].
PG  - 53-62
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is the unique single stranded circular DNA virus, isolated from 
      humans. Viral DNA is shown to be present not only in patients with hepatitis of 
      unknown etiology but also in apparently healthy populations. TTV's role as a 
      causative agent for non A-E hepatitis is widely questioned. In this study, 23 non 
      A-E hepatitis patients (mean age: 46.8 yrs), 21 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients 
      (mean age: 41.0 yrs), 28 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients (mean age: 48.1yrs) have 
      been investigated, together with 90 healthy blood donors (mean age: 33.4 yrs), for 
      the presence of TTV-DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two sets of 
      primers targeting different regions (N22 and NCR) of the viral genome were combined 
      to enhance the detection sensitivity. TTV-DNA was detected in 10 (43.5%) of non A-E 
      hepatitis, 10 (35.7%) of CHC, 4 (19.1%) of CHB patients, and 16 of studied 52 
      (30.8%) blood donors, by N22-PCR. Viral DNA positivity rates by using NCR-PCR were 
      found as follows for the groups respectively; 65.2% (15/23), 50% (14/28), 42.9% 
      (9/21) and 57.8% (52/90). The differences of TTV-DNA positivity rates between study 
      groups were found statistically insignificant, when data from each set of primer 
      were compared (p>0.05). However, the positivity rate of non A-E hepatitis group 
      (91.3%) was significantly higher than CHC (64.2%), CHB (47.6%), and control (57.8%) 
      groups, when the detection sensitivities of both sets were combined (p=0.002 and 
      p=0.046, respectively). The study also revealed that the prevalence of TTV might be 
      underestimated if appropriate molecular methods were not employed. DNA sequencing 
      and genotyping are required to establish TTV's role as a causative agent of non A-E 
      hepatitis and to identify certain genotypes that might have a role in the 
      pathogenesis of hepatitis.

TI  - High frequency of mixed TT virus infections in healthy adults and children detected 
      by a simplified heteroduplex mobility assay.
PG  - 117-25
AB  - Recombinant plasmids carrying 199 base pairs (bp) inserts from the non coding region 
      (nucleotides (nt) 6-204) of the TT virus (TTV) genome were used to standardize an 
      heteroduplex mobility assay able to detect mixed infections of a single individual 
      with several TTV isolates. In this simplified heteroduplex mobility assay, 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were analyzed directly by polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis, without requirement for post-PCR denaturation and annealing 
      steps of the amplicons. The assay was used to test TTV positive serum samples 
      collected from healthy 1-7 years old children, 11-17 years old adolescents, and 
      24-39 years old blood donors living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as well as TTV 
      positive samples from Amazonian Indians. The results showed a very high frequency of 
      multiple infection in all groups, with 20/30 (67%), 31/33 (94%), 35/38 (92%), and 
      34/37 (92%) of the samples collected from children, adolescents, blood donors, and 
      Amazonian Indians, respectively, containing more than one TTV genotype.

TI  - [The significance of TT virus detection in persons with elevated alanine 
      aminotransferase during routine medical check up and patients with liver diseases].
PG  - 276-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of the new DNA virus (TTV) infection in 
      persons with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during routine medical check up 
      and patients with liver diseases, and analyze its pathogenesis. METHODS: PCR was 
      used in the detection of TTV DNA in 19 serum samples from ALT elevated persons and 
      41 from ALT normal persons during their routine medical check up, and 182 serum 
      samples from patients with various kinds of liver diseases. PCR products were 
      confirmed by RFLP. Other hepatitis viruses were simultaneously detected using 
      routine methods. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 10.53% (2/19) and 2.44% (1/41) in 
      groups of ALT elevated and control respectively with no significant difference 
      between their detective rates (P > 0.05). There were 9 cases with current HBV 
      infection, 1 case with hepatitis C and 1 case with hepatitis A in group of elevated 
      ALT. Two TTV positive cases were both superinfected with HBV. The detecting rate of 
      TTV DNA in patients with liver diseases was 4.4%. Only one case out of 18 non A to G 
      hepatitis showed TTV DNA in serum. CONCLUSION: There were TTV infections in Chinese 
      population. The main cause for ALT elevation in persons during routine medical check 
      up was HBV infection. There were TTV infections in patients with liver diseases too. 
      However, TTV wasn't the main cause of non A to G hepatitis. Thus, the pathogenesis 
      of TTV might be very weak.

TI  - TT virus infection in patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology.
PG  - 392-8
AB  - The role of a novel virus, designated as TT virus (TTV), as a cause of chronic liver 
      disease has not been well defined. We investigated the prevalence of TTV among 69 
      patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology and 50 volunteer blood 
      donors with normal transaminase levels. TTV DNA was amplified by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) by using two different sets of primers: one based on the sequence of 
      the original N22 clone within the open reading frame 1 (set A) and the other derived 
      from the untranslated region (set B). The prevalence of TTV detected by PCR primers 
      set A only, set B only, and in total (by either set A or B) was 11 (31%), 31 (86%), 
      and 31 (86%) of 36 patients with chronic hepatitis; 2 (40%), 4 (80%), and 4 (80%) of 
      5 with cirrhosis; 11 (39%), 17 (61%), and 22 (79%) of 28 with hepatocellular 
      carcinoma; and 9 (18%), 39 (78%), and 40 (80%) of 50 volunteer blood donors, 
      respectively. Of the interpretable 25 PCR products amplified with primers set A, 9 
      were classified as genotype 1a, 10 as genotype 1b, 4 as genotype 2, 1 as genotype 3, 
      and 1 as genotype 4. Molecular evolutionary analysis did not suggest any particular 
      strains of TTV that might be associated with chronic liver disease. The nucleotide 
      sequences of the untranslated region on which PCR primers set B were designed were 
      highly conserved, and the interpretable 22 PCR products amplified with primers set B 
      were not clearly divisible into distinct genotypes. Our findings provided no 
      evidence that TTV is a causative agent of chronic liver disease.

TI  - TT virus (TTV)--etiologic agent of acute hepatitis?
PG  - 539-42
AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first isolated in 1997 from the patient with acute 
      posttransfusion hepatitis. This fact led to the conclusion the virus was 
      hepatotropic and could be considered as one of causative agents of acute hepatitis. 
      However, later it was found in other human tissues and serological studies have 
      revealed it is widespread. Multiple tropisms of TTV and the fact the virus is found 
      in high rate of general population, are considered arguments for lack of medical 
      significance of TTV in human pathology. Here we present a report of two cases of 
      acute viral hepatitis in patients hospitalized at the Department of Infectious 
      Diseases, Medical University of Lublin, in whom TTV-DNA was found in serum and 
      serological and virological markers of common primary and secondary hepatotropic 
      viruses were negative. The cases of acute hepatitis we present here should be 
      treated as a preliminary report and the comment in the discussion about the real 
      role of TTV in human pathology.

TI  - Effects of HAART on hepatitis C, hepatitis G, and TT virus in multiply coinfected 
      HIV-positive patients with haemophilia.
PG  - 575-81
AB  - In multiply coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, we 
      investigated the effects of high-activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) using HIV 
      protease inhibitors on three other viruses: hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis G 
      virus (HGV), and TT virus (TTV). Viral concentrations were measured serially by 
      polymerase chain reaction methods in five patients with quadruple infection (HIV, 
      HCV, HGV, and TTV) and in two patients with triple infection (HIV, HCV, and HGV) 
      before and during HAART. In addition, CD4+ cell counts and serum alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured serially. Generally we observed no 
      difference in serum HCV RNA, HGV RNA, or TTV DNA concentrations between samples 
      obtained before and after initiation of HAART, whereas HIV RNA concentration 
      decreased and CD4 counts increased in most patients. However, two patients had 
      markedly decreased concentrations of HCV RNA and HGV RNA, respectively, more than 12 
      months after beginning HAART. Normalization of serum ALT levels was observed in a 
      patient with decline of HCV RNA concentrations. No interactions were observed among 
      these four viruses. HAART had no apparent direct effects on HCV, HGV, or TTV. 
      Further studies will be required to elucidate whether the restoration of immune 
      status through suppression of HIV replication by HAART may affect HCV or HGV RNA 
      concentrations.

TI  - [Establishment of ELISA with TT virus(TTV) and its application to patients with

PG  - 160-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the EIA method for detection of antibody to TT virus 
      (anti-TTV) and to investigate the distribution of anti-TTV in patients with 
      hepatitis and in healthy people. METHODS: The ELISA method using the recombinant 
      expressed product of truncated gene of TTV ORF1 as antigen was developed and was 
      applied to detect anti-TTV in patients with hepatitis and in healthy control. The 
      TTV DNA were detected by nested-PCR. RESULTS: The positive rates of anti-TTV 
      antibodies in different populations were as follows: 1.3% in healthy people, 10.5% 
      in patients with hepatitis A, 12.5% in patients with hepatitis B, 8.3% in patients 
      with hepatitis C, 7.7% in patients with hepatitis D, 12.0% in patients with 
      hepatitis E, 6.5% in patients with hepatitis G, 32.3% in patients with hepatitis 
      non-A to G. The positive rate of TTV DNA was significantly related to that of 
      anti-TTV (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The anti-TTV antibodies were detected positive in 
      patients with hepatitis and healthy people, however, its positive rate in patients 
      with hepatitis non-A to G was significantly higher than that in other groups. The 
      fact that anti-TTV antibodies coexist with TTV DNA suggests that the antibody to TTV 
      ORF1 antigen may be an infectious marker of TTV similar to that of anti-HCV.

AB  - TT virus is a recently discovered virus, of which the pathogenetic potential is 
      still uncertain. The present paper describes the histopathological features of a 
      case of TT virus-related acute recurrent hepatitis. The patient is a 28-year-old 
      woman with no history of drug or alcohol abuse, presenting with repeated episodes of 
      hypertransaminasemia evidenced during the last 4 years. No other markers of viral or 
      autoimmune disease were found. On histological analysis, the liver parenchyma showed 
      a preserved architecture. The histological features were those of a mild acute 
      hepatitis. The clinicopathological findings suggest th

TI  - TT virus infection does not affect the clinical profiles of patients with hepatitis 
      B and C in Yanbian City, China.
PG  - 214-21
AB  - China is an area of high endemicity for viral hepatitis, and the molecular 
      epidemiological investigation of TT virus (TTV) infection is of interest. In the 
      present study, we investigated the epidemiology, clinical significance and molecular 
      characteristics of TTV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in 
      Yanbian City, China. Serum samples obtained from 74 patients with hepatitis B and 
      hepatitis C who visited Yanbian Hospital, located in northeast China, were analyzed 
      in this study. The study group included 22 cases of chronic hepatitis B (B-CH), 17 
      cases of liver cirrhosis B (B-LC), 7 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (B-HCC), 16 
      cases of chronic hepatitis C (C-CH), 11 cases of liver cirrhosis C (C-LC) and 1 case 
      of hepatocellular carcinoma (C-HCC). Detection of TTV DNA was performed as described 
      by Nishizawa et al. The second-round PCR products from 7 subjects were sequenced, 
      followed by investigation of nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis. TTV DNA 
      was present in 18.2, 5.9, 28.6, 6.3, 9.1 and 0% of the patients with B-CH, B-LC, 
      B-HCC, C-CH, C-LC and C-HCC, respectively. The highest prevalence of TTV infection 
      was seen in the groups aged 40-50 and over 60 years. There was no significant 
      correlation between the presence of TTV DNA and the clinical parameters in patients 
      with hepatitis B and C. The various isolates showed 97.9-100% with isolates reported 
      previously from Japan and 98.4-100% with isolates reported previously from China. 
      Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the Yanbian isolates could be classified 
      in the same group as the Japan and China isolates. We concluded that chronic 
      coinfection with TTV did not affect the serological features of chronic hepatitis B 
      and C in China, as found in Tokyo, Japan.

PG  - 10-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study its pathogenecity based on infection status and replication of 
      transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in the liver tissues. METHODS: Using recombinant 
      plasmid as template and symmetrical and asymmetrical polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR), double-strand and single-strand TTV probes were labeled with digoxigenin. 
      Fifty-six cases of liver biopsy specimens were detected by in situ hybridization, 
      and six positive cases of them were tested further with single-strand probes. 
      RESULTS: TTV DNA was found in 14 of 51 patients with non A and non G hepatitis 
      (27.5%), and five cases in the control group were negative. TTV DNA was mainly 
      observed in the nuclei of hepatocytes and pathologic changes and necrosis in the 
      infected liver cells were not so apparent, but they could be seen in the liver 
      tissues of acute, chronic and severe hepatitis, as well as of liver cirrhosis. TTV 
      genome strand hybridization detected by single-strand probe was consistent with that 
      by double-strand probe. Both TTV genome strand and its complementary strand were 
      present in the two cases of liver specimens, but hybridizational signals were weaker 
      in the latter than those in the former. CONCLUSION: TTV could cause injury and 
      replicate itself in the liver, but no obvious and direct injury to hepatocytes.

PG  - 363-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) and 
      its sequence characterization in China. METHODS: TTV DNA was amplified by 
      Semi-Nested-PCR, and the positive products were sequenced directly. RESULTS: The 
      homology of partial nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 7 Chinese TTV isolates 
      were 64.7%-98.4% and 62.7%-96.4% respectively when compared with Japanese isolate. 
      Among 7 Chinese TTV isolates, the homology of partial nucleotide and amino acid 
      sequences were 63.5%-98.4% and 60.2%-96.4% respectively. They differently belong to 
      two genotypes and two subgenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: There exists TTV in China, and 
      there might be several genotypes of Chinese TTV isolates.

PG  - 31-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of TTV genomes in young children from 
      Nanjing and establish the PCR method for detecting TTV DNA. METHODS: A hemi-nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was established to detect TTV DNA in 110 young 
      children and two PCR-amplified products were sequenced and the data were analyzed 
      with the computer programs. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 14 out of 110 children, 
      and 222 bp sequences of 2 isolates from the children were analyzed. Compared with 
      representative of published isolates, they have the nucleotide identity of 
      93.7%-98.6% with TX011. CONCLUSIONS: The infection rate of TTV in children is 
      12.73%, and 2 isolates from children belong to subgroup G1b. Our results indicates 
      that TTV could be transmitted via other pathway besides hematogenous one, and TTV 
      could be carried by healthy population.

PG  - 9-13
AB  - AIM: To examine clinical, immunological and morphological features of HGV- and 
      TTV-infections in patients with chronic hepatic diseases (CHD) and assess efficiency 
      of treatment of HGV-seropositive patients. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 202 patients with 
      CHD were examined for markers of HBV-, HCV-, HGV- and TTV-infections. Some patients 
      were subjected to puncture biopsy of the liver. Efficiency of interferon-alpha 
      treatment of HGV and HBV/HCV coinfection was studied. RESULTS: HGV RNA and TTV DNA 
      were detected in 19.8 and 11.8% of cases, respectively. Biochemical indices in 
      patients with HGV and TTV monoinfections significantly differed from those in the 
      control group while morphological changes in most of them corresponded to those with 
      hepatitis. INF-alpha was given to 7 patients with HGV + HBV/HCV infections. A 
      response was achieved in 3 months in 2 of them. CONCLUSION: The role of HGV and TTV 
      in hepatic diseases pathology is still unclear. Further studies on detection and 
      examination of patients infected with G and TT viruses are necessary. When choosing 
      therapy, the presence of HGV RNA and TTV DNA in blood serum, virus genome in 
      hepatocytes and histological changes in hepatic tissue should be considered.

      contained 199 bp (1-199), 3 269 bp (38 approximately 3 306) and 434 bp (3 306 
      approximately 3 739) separately. These PCR products were sequenced by the standard 
      method. RESULTS: The complete TTV gene (named as TTV CHN1) consisting of 3 739 
      nucleotides contained two ORFs. The first ORF located at 589 approximately 2 901 nt, 
      coding 770 amino acids; the second located at 107 approximately 715 nt, coding 202 
      amino acids. In this genome, G is 22.25%, C 25.54%, A 31.26% and T 20.97%. The 
      homology of Chinese and Japanese TTV genes was more than 94% at both nucleotide and 
      amino acid levels. There exists a hyper-variation region (HVR) spanning at 1 380 
      approximately 1 800 bp. In this region, the HVR homology of Chinese and Japanese TTV 
      genes was 88% and 81% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. CONCLUSION: 
      Chinese and Japanese TTV isolates belong to the same genotype. There exists a 
      hyper-variation region (HVR) spanning at 1 380 approximately 1 800 bp.

TI  - Low prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV)-like DNA sequences in 
      cystadenolymphoma and pleomorphic adenoma of the salivary glands.
PG  - 759-63
AB  - Titers of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV)-like DNA in saliva samples have been 
      reported 100-1,000 times higher than those of the corresponding sera, suggesting 
      viral transmission by saliva droplets. The present study was conducted to determine 
      whether TTV-like DNA sequence elements play a role in the pathogenesis of 
      cystadenolymphoma or pleomorphic adenoma and if the parotid or the submandibular 
      gland is a major source of TTV persistence. Sixty-two archival salivary gland 
      samples (16 cystadenolymphomas, 13 pleomorphic adenomas, and 33 controls) and 23 
      corresponding saliva samples were examined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      for TTV DNA. All PCR products that displayed DNA bands were sequenced. Leder's stain 
      and immunohistochemistry (anti-CD8, anti-CD20, anti-CD45R0, anti-CD68, and 
      anti-Ki67/MiB1) were applied to detect possible changes associated with findings of 
      TTV-like DNA sequences. Tissue displayed TTV-like DNA sequences in 8.1% (5/62; 
      saliva: 47.8%, 11/23). Tissue that contained TTV-like DNA sequences was 
      histologically indistinguishable from samples lacking such DNA. TTV appears to be 
      only a bystander in cystadenolymphoma, pleomorphic adenoma, and other salivary gland 
      affections. Neither of the glands seems to be a major source of TTV persistence.

AB  - To investigate infection and sequence divergence of TT virus in various population, 
      a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay with primers from TTV ORF1 genome 
      was used to detect serum TTV DNA. TTV DNAs from various population were cloned and 
      sequenced. Six gene sequences derived from two patients with non-A through non-E and 
      non-G hepatitis, a hepatitis patient with HBsAg, a normal blood donor, an 
      intravenous drug user and a woman prostitute, were compared with known sequence of 
      TTV isolate (N22) reported by Okamoto, Japan. The nucleotide homology were 96%-98% 
      and the whole sequences belonged to la genotype. The data indicate that TTV DNA from 
      various population in China might chiefly be la genotype. There is no correlation 
      between genotype and disease transmission and development.

TI  - Persistent TT virus infection does not contribute to the development of non-A to -G 
      hepatocellular carcinoma. A case-control study of 19 patients in Japan.
PG  - 80-6
AB  - We tested the sera of patients with non-A, non-B, non-C, non-G (non-A to -G) 
      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the presence of TT virus (TTV) DNA and 
      clinicopathologically elucidated the relationship between TTV infection and 
      hepatocarcinogenesis. The study cohort consisted of 19 patients with non-A to -G 
      HCC. Detection of TTV DNA was performed by the nested polymerase chain reaction 
      according to a previously published method. TTV DNA was detected in the sera of 9 
      (47.4%) of the 19 patients with non-A to -G HCC. The clinical background factors and 
      blood biochemical parameters of the TTV-DNA-positive and -negative HCC patients did 
      not significantly differ. Three TTV-DNA-positive and 2 TTV-DNA-negative patients 
      underwent surgical resection of the HCC. The histological findings in the 
      non-cancerous liver tissue of the TTV-DNA-positive and -negative patients did not 
      significantly differ. In conclusion, TTV infection does not affect the features of 
      non-A to -G HCC.

PG  - 241-4
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction assay with nested primers (nested PCR) deduced from the 
      well conserved sequences of TTV ORF1 region was established to detect TTV DNA. PCR 
      products from the 2 patients with non A-G hepatitis were cloned and sequenced to 
      confirm its specificity. By using this assay, we tested the serum samples of 90 
      normal individuals, 88 paid blood donors, 79 intravenous drug users and 29 patients 
      with non A-G hepatitis in Shenzhen, China. The positive rates of TTV DNA were 7.8%, 
      9.0%, 41.7% and 44.8%, respectively. TTV DNA was detected in 14 of the 90 normal 
      individuals and 88 paid blood donors without any symptoms of liver disease. The 
      results of this study suggest that TTV infection is common in normal population and 
      the paid blood donors. The intravenous drug users are at high risk for TTV 
      infection. TTV would be responsible for a part of non A-G hepatitis.

PG  - 79-81
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the distribution of anti-TTV antibody and the different 
      ORF gene in different populations of China. METHODS: The antibody to TTV in sera 
      collected from different population were detected by using ELISA and the different 
      ORF genes were amplified with PCR. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV ORF1 DNA, ORF2 
      DNA and the antibody in various populations were as follows: 16.0% (12/75), 10.7% 
      (8/75) and 25.3% (19/75) in paid blood donors; 10.0 (3/30), 16.7% (5/30) and 16.7% 
      (5/30) in patients with hepatitis A, 47.5% (19/40), 42.5% (17/40) and 22.5% (9/40) 
      in patients with hepatitis B; 42.9% (15/35), 37.1% (13/35) and 28.6% (10/35) in 
      patients with hepatitis C; 20.0% (3/15), 26.7% (4/15) and 13.3% (2/15)in patients 
      with hepatitis D; 16.7% (2/12),16.7% (2/12) and 33.3% (4/12)in patients with 
      hepatitis E; 23.8% (5/21), 38.1% (8/21) and 23.8% (5/21) in patients with hepatitis 
      G; 61.1% (11/18), 50.0% (9/18) and 44.4% (8/18) in patients with non A-G hepatitis, 
      respectively. The positive rate of different ORF DNA had no significant difference. 
      Significant differences were found in the positive rates of TTV DNA in various 
      populations. There was no relationship between the TTV DNA and the antibody to TTV. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The antibody to TTV and TTV DNA were found in every population of 
      China. There was no significant difference in the positive rates of TTV DNA between 
      ORF1 and ORF2. The positive rate in patients with non A-G hepatitis was higher than 
      those in the other populations.

      blood donors].
PG  - 237-40
AB  - In order to investigate TTV infection in blood donors, 262 sera samples from blood 
      donors were detected by nested--PCR method using primers from ORF1 of TTV genome 
      DNA. The results showed that 18 of 58(31.0%) serum samples from blood donors with 
      elevated transaminase level were positive for TTV DNA. 30 of 204 (14.7%) sera 
      samples from blood donors with normal transaminase levels were positive for TTV DNA. 
      There were significant difference between them (chi 2 = 38.1, P < 0.05). Five 
      products of PCR for TTV DNA were purified and cloned to T Vector. The sequence 
      analysis showed that there were above 97% nucleotide identity among AB008394 (from 
      Japan), TTVCHNI (from China) and our 5 isolates from blood donors. The results 
      suggest that there exists TTV infection among blood donors in China. TTV may be 
      transmitted by blood transfusion. Our isolates, AB008394 and TTVCHN1 share a same 
      genotype.

TI  - TT virus infection in screened Taiwanese blood donors.
PG  - 198-200
AB  - OBJECTIVE: TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered human DNA virus of uncertain 
      clinical significance. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TTV 
      infection among blood donors in Taiwan. METHODS: Viral DNA was studied in 224 
      healthy blood donors and 118 deferred donors. DNA was extracted from plasma and 
      amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction with reported primer sets from a 
      conserved region of the TTV genome. RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV DNA in the 
      deferred donors was 24.6%, significantly higher than in the healthy donors (11.9%). 
      TTV was also more prevalent in those with hepatitis B surface antigen than in those 
      without it (p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: In comparing normal with deferred Taiwanese 
      blood donors, hepatitis B virus infection is linked to a higher prevalence of TTV 
      infection.

      populations in China. METHODS: TTV DNA and anti TTV IgG were simultaneously tested 
      by PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV DNA in the samples of 81 normal 
      subjects, 92 blood donors, 123 hepatitis A-G patients and 32 hepatitis non A-G 
      patients were 2.5%, 2.2%, 19.5% and 28.1%, respectively; and anti-TTV IgG was 1.2%, 
      3.7%, 26.8% and 34.4%, respectively. There were significant differences between the 
      normal and the blood donor group and the hepatitis group; and among multi-infectious 
      cases, the infection rate of TTV with HBV was as high as 75.0%. CONCLUSION: The 
      investigation indicated that TTV infection was very popular in different groups. 
      Some of the normal and blood donor groups infected with TTV could become healthy 
      carries of virus. And the hepatitis patients were the high risk group. In addition, 
      TTV may be transmitted via other pathways besides blood.

AB  - 104 serum samples from patients with liver diseases were detected for TTV DNA by 
      nested-PCR method. The results showed that 25 of 104(24%) were positive for TTV DNA. 
      Among 104 samples, 48%(12/42) were positive for nonA-E and G 19% (4/12) were 
      positive for hepatitis A 25% (8/32) were positive hepatitis B 11.1% (1/9) was 
      positive hepatitis C 4 of 6(66.7%) fulminant hepatitis cases were detected positive 
      for TTV DNA. The partial gene of two TTV isolates from the patients were cloned and 
      sequenced. The sequence analysis shows that there is 98.4% nucleotide identity 
      between AB008394(from Japan) and one isolate from the patient (TTVEC023). The 
      results suggest that TTV is associated with acute, chronic and fulminant hepatitis. 
      TTV infection would be the important cause of non A-E and G hepatitis.

      TTV DNA in the serum was tested by nested PCR and the clinical data was analyzed. 
      RESULTS: Infection rate of the TTV in cryptogenic hepatitis was 38.6%. It was a 
      sporadic disease, and involved mainly the adults, with no sexual difference. The 
      symptoms were notable, often with jaundice, but the level of transaminase were 
      elevated moderately. Histology revealed the portal area inflammation. If accompanied 
      with other disease, the illness would be exacerbated. CONCLUSION: TTV would be 
      accounted for part of the reason in patients with cryptogenic hepatitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical significance of gene variant of transfusion 
      transmitted virus (TTV). METHODS: A nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) 
      assay with specific primers from open reading frame one (ORF1) of TTV genome was 
      established to detect TTV DNA in the serum samples from patients with hepatitis B 
      and blood donors. Asymmetric PCR was established to get single strand DNA in the TTV 
      DNA positive cases, and then single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was 
      applied. RESULTS: 1.25 +/- 0.50, 1.60 +/- 0.55, 3.36 +/- 1.36 and 4.59 +/- 1.83 SSCP 
      bands were detected in the blood donors, chronic HBV carriers, chronic hepatitis B 
      patients and chronic severe hepatitis B patients respectively. SSCP bands were much 
      more complicated in chronic hepatitis patients and chronic severe hepatitis than 
      those of chronic HBV carriers and blood donors (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: There is gene 
      variant in TTV infection. The complication of gene variant strain or quasispecies 
      infection of TTV may be one of the causes responsible for clinical exacerbation of 
      TTV superinfection in chronic hepatitis patients.

AB  - To investigate transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection in the hepatitis 
      patients and blood donors in Hunan, we used nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) 
      assay with primers from TTV genome to detect TTV DNA in seventy clinical hepatitis 
      cases and forty-three blood donors. The results were as follows: TTV DNA was 
      positive in ten of thirty eight patients with hepatitis B(26.3%), and twelve of 
      thirty-two patients with non-A through non-E(37.5%). Elevated transaminase (ALT) was 
      observed in those cases (452 U.L-1 and 582 U.L-1, respectively). On the other hand, 
      TTV DNA was positive in four of forty-three normal blood donors. The data indicate 
      that infectious rates of TTV in hepatitis patients and blood donors in Hunan are 
      similar to those in Japan, and TTV's pathogenicity needs further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) replicates in the 
      liver and to analyze the relationship between TTV and cryptogenic hepatitis. 
      METHODS: A 3.2 kb TTV fragment was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) in 31 serum samples of patients with cryptogenic hepatitis who came from a 
      school where was in an outbreak area of cryptogenic hepatitis during 1996 and in 30 
      healthy individuals. A hybridization/nuclease protection assay was used to detect 
      positive-strand TTV fragment from the liver specimens of the 7 patients. RESULTS: 
      TTV DNA was detected in serum samples from 30 of 31 (96.9%) patients and from 18 of 
      30 (60%) healthy individuals, respectively. There was significant difference in the 
      prevalence of TTV infection between the two groups. Based on hybridization/ nuclease 
      protection assays, we detected positive-strand TTV fragment in all of 7 liver 
      specimens of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: TTV is related possibly to cryptogenic 
      hepatitis. TTV can replicate in the liver. Although TTV only causes mild liver 
      damage, a few patients will suffer from chronic hepatitis.

TI  - [Distribution of TT virus genotypes in blood donors of northern China].
PG  - 284-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the distribution of TT virus (TTV) genotypes in the blood 
      donors of Northern China. METHODS: TTV DNA was detected using nested-PCR and its PCR 
      products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector for sequencing. The sequences were 
      analysed using ClustalX and Neighbor joining programs. RESULTS: Nucleotide identity 
      of the 12 strains of Chinese TTV isolated was 53%-95%. Nucleotide homology between 
      the representatives of genotype 1a and 1b [TX011(O), TA278] and the 12 strains of 
      TTV was 55%-94% and 55%-75%, respectively. Of the 12 Chinese TTV isolates, eight 
      were classified as genotype 1b, three as unknown genotype X and one as unknown 
      genotype Y, which accounted for 66.7%, 25% and 8.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      exceptional degree of genetic heterogeneity was displayed in TTV nucleotide 
      sequences and they could be, at least, classified as three genotypes. Genotype 1b 
      may be the main prevalent genotype in blood donors of Northern China.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the TTV- like mini virus (TLMV) infection in Chinese 
      patients with non A-G hepatitis and to analyse sequence of 5' non-coding region 
      (5'NCR)of TLMV. METHODS: TLMV DNA was detected by nested - PCR from 53 serum samples 
      of non A-G hepatitis patients without TTV infection. PCR products were cloned and 
      sequenced. RESULTS: TLMV DNA were positive in 37 of 53 patients (69.8%). The 
      sequence of 5' NCR of 8 TLMV isolates was compared with that reported by Takahashi 
      (GenBank Accession No. ab 026930-026931) and showed nucleotide identity between 64% 
      - 83%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that TLMV infection is 
      common in TTV negative patients with non A-G hepatitis. The 5' NCR sequence of TLMV 
      showed a great degree of diversity. The pathogenicity of TLMV and its relationship 
      to non A-G hepatitis need to be confirmed and further study is required.

AB  - A 12-year-old Japanese boy suffered from severe acute hepatitis and pancytopenia. 
      The patient underwent successful bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical 
      sister. Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA of genotype 1a and IgM-class antibody against 
      the virus were detected in sera at the onset of hepatitis. TTV/1a DNA and 
      anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody levels were undetectable on the 16th and 46th days after 
      the onset of illness, respectively. Anti-TTV/1a IgG antibody was positive throughout 
      the observation period. Sequential viral load and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody suggested 
      a primary infection of TTV/1a. Genomic sequence of the virus coincided with that of 
      the original strain first isolated from human. TTV DNA was quantified at 130 copies 
      in 10(5) bone marrow mononuclear cells, which suggested that infection of 
      hematopoietic cells might be the cause of aplasia. This is the first report of TTV 
      hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia assessed by the anti-TTV antibodies and viral 
      load in peripheral blood and bone marrow.

TI  - Early acquisition of TT virus in infants: possible minor role of maternal 
      transmission.
PG  - 285-90
AB  - This study assessed the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) viremia in pregnant women and 
      evaluated the role of maternal transmission in early acquisition of TTV in infants 
      in Taiwan. Two groups of pregnant women were screened for TTV using polymerase chain 
      reaction. The first group included 135 healthy pregnant women attending the 
      obstetrics department for routine prenatal care and the second group from 25 GB 
      virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV)-infected mothers. In both groups, when TTV 
      infection was found in mothers, serial serum samples were collected for the infants 
      at regular intervals until 1 year of age and were tested for TTV DNA. The results 
      showed that 40% (54/135) of the women undergoing routine prenatal care and 56% 
      (14/25) of GBV-C/HGV-infected pregnant women were positive for TTV DNA (P = 0.137). 
      Of the 54 TTV-infected mothers in the routine prenatal group, 29 and their 30 
      infants received regular follow-up. The positive rate of TTV DNA in infants was 40% 
      (12/30) in the routine prenatal group and 29% (4/14) in the group with 
      GBV-C/HGV-infected mothers (P = 0.463). All but 2 of the 16 TTV-infected infants had 
      normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels during follow-up. The phylogenetic 
      analysis in 7 mother-infant pairs showed that the homology was diverse in each pair 
      and a close genetic relatedness was found in 2 mother-infant pairs. In conclusion, 
      TTV viremia is common in pregnant Taiwanese women and their infants. However, the 
      results suggest that maternal transmission may play only a minor role in early 
      acquisition of TTV in infants.

TI  - TTV and HPV co-infection in cervical smears of patients with cervical lesions.
PG  - 118
LID - 10.1186/1471-2334-9-118 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The female lower genital tract is a gateway for pathogens entering the 
      host through the mucous membrane. One of the prevalent human viruses is Torque teno 
      virus (TTV). The major reported routes of TTV transmission are fecal-oral and 
      parenteral. Furthermore, other modes of transmission, e.g. sexual contact, are 
      suggested. To investigate the sexual route of TTV transmission, cervical smears of 
      healthy women and those with cervical lesions were screened for the presence of TTV 
      DNA. METHODS: TTV DNA was studied in cervical smears of 95 patients with cervical 
      lesions and 55 healthy women. Paired serum samples were available from 55 and 42 
      women, respectively. All healthy women had normal cytology while 44 patients had 
      histologically confirmed low-grade lesion (LGL) and 51 high-grade lesion (HGL). TTV 
      DNA was detected with primers specific for the non-coding region. In 40 paired 
      cervical smears and serum samples, the phylogenetic group of TTV isolates was 
      determined. The presence of HPV DNA in cervical smears was detected by means of PCR 
      with MY09/11 primers. RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears of 
      healthy women was 52.7% and was comparable with that in paired serum samples (50%). 
      Symptomatic women had significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears 
      (74.7%) than healthy controls. The TTV DNA prevalence in patient serum samples was 
      51%. The phylogenetic groups of TTV serum isolates were concordant with those of TTV 
      from cervical smears of the same subjects. In cervical smears, a wider variety of 
      TTV isolates was found. The viral loads in cervical smears were 10 to 1000 times as 
      high as in sera. The HPV-positive study subjects had significantly higher TTV DNA 
      prevalence than HPV negatives. The prevalence of TTV was not associated with disease 
      severity. CONCLUSION: High prevalence of TTV in cervical smears suggests that sexual 
      transmission is another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the population. The 
      higher viral load in cervical smears than in the respective serum samples might 
      indicate active TTV replication in the female genital tract. Nevertheless, 
      cooperation between TTV and HPV needs to be further investigated.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Quantification of titers of ubiquitous viruses such as Torque teno virus 
      (TTV) that do not cause clinical symptoms might be helpful in assessing the immune 
      status of an individual. We hereby describe the validation of a SYBR Green-based TTV 
      quantification method for plasma samples. METHODS: Plasmids with TTV specific 
      inserts were used for preparing standards and absolute quantification of TTV was 
      performed using SYBR Green methodology. The method was assessed for its accuracy and 
      precision (intra and inter-day) on four non-consecutive days. TTV was also 
      quantified from plasma samples of 20 healthy volunteers and from 30 hematopoietic 
      stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. RESULTS: The assay was specific and showed 
      satisfactory efficiency (82.2%, R2=0.99) with the limit of quantification defined as 
      100 copies per reaction. The assay had good precision (inter and intra-day 
      coefficient of variation in cycle threshold (CT) < 4%) and accuracy (100 ± 10%) in 
      the range of 100 to 1010 copies/reaction. We found TTV loads ranging from 2.5 - 4.07 
      log copies/mL of plasma with CT (mean ± SD) of 33.8 ± 1.77 in healthy individuals 
      and 2.06 - 8.49 log copies/mL of plasma with CT (mean ± SD) of 24.3 ± 1.04 in HSCT 
      recipients. CONCLUSION: SYBR Green-based q-PCR assay combines simplicity with 
      satisfactory sensitivity and may be suitable for monitoring the immune status of 
      transplant recipients, where TTV loads over time may serve as a marker for immune 
      reconstitution in human plasma samples.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tissue tropism of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), 
      a novel nonenveloped DNA virus, in experimentally infected Rhesus monkey. METHODS: 
      Filtrate of feces of one patient with TTV infection was fed into the stomachs of ten 
      Rhesus monkeys. Five (?) monkeys were killed during viremia and their tissues were 
      collected to be examined for the presence of replicative virus DNA by in situ 
      hybridization, dot blot hybridization with antisense probe and 
      hybridization/nuclease protection assay. RESULTS: The virus contents (density of 
      electrophoretic band) in the liver, PBMC, and serum of three infected monkeys 50.1%, 
      31.0%, and 18.9% respectively; the relative proportion was 2.65;1.64;1.00. TTV was 
      detected in liver, spleen, stomach, small intestine and its lymph nodes, PBMC, 
      colon, and serum; however, viral plus-chain, a putative replicative intermediate, 
      was found only in liver, spleen, small intestine, and lymphoid cells. CONCLUSION: 
      Transfusion transmitted virus is hepato-, spleno-, and lymphoid cell-tropic, and may 
      has multiple routes of transmission.

AB  - Clinical characteristics of transmitted transfusion virus (TTV) infection and its 
      pathogenicity in children were evaluated. Serum TTV DNA from 118 children (mean age: 
      7.8 +/- 2.8 years) was detected by nested PCR. The product of PCR was cloned and 
      sequenced. The positive rate for serum TTV-DNA in 20 healthy children, 9 cases of 
      acute hepatitis, 51 cases of chronic hepatitis, 24 cases of nephritis or nephrotic 
      syndrome and 14 cases of hypoplastic anemia or acute leukemia was 20%, 11%, 29%, 42% 
      and 21% respectively, but there was no significant difference in TTV-DNA frequency 
      among them (P > 0.05). Of the 16 patients receiving immunosuppressive agent for a 
      long time, 7 (44%) were positive for TTV-DNA, and of the 17 cases not receiving 
      immunosuppressive agent, 5 (29%) were positive with the difference being not 
      significant (P > 0.05). Essential characteristics were pathogen-carrier or 
      asymptomatic infection in children with TTV infection. Long-term employment of 
      immunosuppressive agent did not increase the incidence in TTV infection. There was 
      still high prevalence in TTV infection in healthy children not receiving blood 
      product, suggesting the possibility of non hematogenous transmitted transfusion in 
      TTV transmission.

TI  - Evidence of Torque teno virus (TTV) vertical transmission in swine.
PG  - 1390-5
LID - 10.1016/j.theriogenology.2009.01.010 [doi]
AB  - Routes of swine torque teno virus (TTV) transmission have been minimally 
      investigated in the pig population. Current knowledge suggests the faecal-oral route 
      as the most probable way of viral dissemination. Other transmission routes, such as 
      mother-to-infant, have been studied in humans, but no information is available for 
      swine. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of 
      two swine TTV genogroups, TTV1 and TTV2, in colostrum samples (n=61) and sera 
      samples from sows (n=10) and stillborn pigs coming from them (n=30). Colostrum was 
      fractioned into two components, milk whey and cell pellets, and 26 out of 61 milk 
      whey samples and 30 out of 58 cell pellets analyzed contained TTV1 or TTV2 genomes, 
      respectively, detected by specific PCR methods. Six and 3 out of 10 serum samples 
      from sows were positive for TTV1 and TTV2 DNA, respectively. Finally, 15 out of 30 
      sera from stillborns were PCR positive for TTV1, but only 2 were TTV2 positive. 
      Positive stillborns were always infected with the same TTV genogroup as their 
      mothers. However, TTV sequence analysis determined that sequences obtained from sows 
      and their stillborns were not identical. In conclusion, our results indicated that 
      swine TTVs can be transmitted vertically, and suggest that different sow-to-piglet 
      transmission routes may coexist, including transplacental/intra-uterine as well as 
      through lactation. This study represents the first description of swine TTV presence 
      in colostrum and stillborn piglets.

TI  - Real-time PCR methods for independent quantitation of TTV and TLMV.
PG  - 59-67
AB  - There is considerable interest in the possible clinical effects of the human 
      circoviruses TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV). Most people appear to 
      have at least one of these viruses replicating actively in their bodies, thus mere 
      correlation of the presence of virus and disease states are probably less 
      informative than a quantitative analysis of viraemia. Real-time PCR based methods, 
      with either SYBR Green or TaqMan probe, designed to quantitate selectively TTV and 
      TLMV are described. The suggested TaqMan-based protocols were suitable for 
      quantitation of viruses in the range of 10(2)-10(9) copies/ml of sample; and proved, 
      by sequencing of PCR products, to be specific for each of the two viruses.

TI  - [TT virus infection in liver transplant recipients with cryptogennic cirrhosis].
PG  - 177-81
AB  - The possible causative role of novel TT virus in liver diseases has been intensively 
      studied in regarding its hepatotrophy, ability to cause persistent infection and 
      worldwide prevalence. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence as well 
      as the clinical importance of TTV in a normal healthy population group in the Czech 
      Republic and in a group of liver transplant recipients diagnosed with cryptogenic 
      cirrhosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the DNA of TT virus in 68% 
      (13/19) of samples isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes and in 21% (4/19) of 
      plasma samples in the liver transplant group. The viral DNA was detected only in 
      11.8% (4/34) of leukocytes and in no plasma sample from the healthy population 
      control group. All patients included in this study had good liver function and had 
      no complications during the postoperative period. The prevalence of TTV DNA 
      detection in healthy control group in Czech republic is similar to the rates 
      reported in European and North American countries. Significant difference was proved 
      between the prevalences of TTV in the groups of healthy controls and liver 
      transplant recipients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. However, no association of TTV 
      infection with possible postoperative complications could be found.

TI  - A novel variant of torque teno virus 7 identified in patients with Kawasaki disease.
PG  - e0209683

LID - e0209683
AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD), first identified in 1967, is a pediatric vasculitis of 
      unknown etiology that has an increasing incidence in Japan and many other countries. 
      KD can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Its epidemiological characteristics, such as 
      seasonality and clinical picture of acute systemic inflammation with prodromal 
      intestinal/respiratory symptoms, suggest an infectious etiology for KD. 
      Interestingly, multiple host genotypes have been identified as predisposing factors 
      for KD. To explore experimental methodology for identifying etiological agent(s) for 
      KD and to optimize epidemiological study design (particularly the sample size) for 
      future studies, we conducted a pilot study. For a 1-year period, we prospectively 
      enrolled 11 patients with KD. To each KD patient, we assigned two control 
      individuals (one with diarrhea and the other with respiratory infections), matched 
      for age, sex, and season of diagnosis. During the acute phase of disease, we 
      collected peripheral blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and feces. We also determined 
      genotypes, to identify those that confer susceptibility to KD. There was no 
      statistically significant difference in the frequency of the risk genotypes between 
      KD patients and control subjects. We also used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to 
      analyze these samples. Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 
      (TTV7) in two patients with KD (18%), but not in control subjects (P = 0.111). 
      Sanger sequencing revealed that the TTV7 found in the two KD patients contained 
      almost identical variants in nucleotide and identical changes in resulting amino 
      acid, relative to the reference sequence. Additionally, we estimated the sample size 
      that would be required to demonstrate a statistical correlation between TTV7 and KD. 
      Future larger scale studies with carefully optimized metagenomic sequencing 
      experiments and adequate sample size are warranted to further examine the 
      association between KD and potential pathogens, including TTV7.

TI  - Quantification of Torque Teno Virus Viremia as a Prospective Biomarker for 
      Infectious Disease in Kidney Allograft Recipients.
PG  - 1191-1199
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiy306 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced immunosuppression following kidney transplantation is 
      crucial to prevent allograft rejection, but increases risk for infectious disease. 
      Tailoring of drug dosing to prevent both rejection and infection is greatly 
      desirable. The apathogenic and ubiquitous torque teno virus (TTV) reflects 
      immunocompetence of the host and might be a potential candidate for immunologic 
      monitoring. METHODS: To assess TTV as an infection biomarker, virus load was 
      prospectively quantified in peripheral blood of 169 consecutive renal allograft 
      recipients at the Medical University Vienna. RESULTS: Patients with infection showed 
      higher TTV levels compared to patients without infection (4.2 × 108 copies/mL 
      [interquartile range, IQR, 2.7 × 107-1.9 × 109] vs 2.9 × 107 [IQR 1.0 × 106-7.2 × 
      108]; P = .006). Differences in TTV load became evident almost 3 months before 
      infection (median 77 days, IQR 19-98). Each log level of TTV copies/mL increased the 
      odds ratio for infection by 23% (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.45; P = .014). TTV 
      >3.1 × 109 copies/mL corresponded to 90% sensitivity to predict infections. Logistic 
      regression demonstrated independent association between TTV levels and infection. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TTV quantification predicts infection after kidney transplantation and 
      might be a potential tool to tailor immunosuppressive drug therapy.

TI  - Polymorphism of the TT virus and its frequency in Polish blood donors.
PG  - 177-81
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine, in Polish blood donors, the frequency of TT virus (TTV) 
      using different primers and the sequence diversity of TTV genotypes. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Two-hundred blood donors were studied. TTV DNA was detected by the 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers for the coding (ORF1) and non-coding 
      (NC) regions. Twenty isolates were genotyped by sequencing the ORF1 fragment. 
      RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 78% of donors using NC primers and in 10% using 
      ORF1 primers. The frequency of TTV DNA detection by NC primers was observed to 
      increase with donor age, whereas the frequency of detection by ORF primers did not 
      differ between various age-groups. The nucleotide sequence homology of Polish TTV 
      isolates ranged from 59 to 99%. Three genotypes (1b, 2b and 2c) were identified. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The frequency of TTV detection depends on the primers used for the PCR. 
      Using the NC primers the virus is detected in the majority of donors, whereas the 
      ORF1 primers strongly underestimate the prevalence of TTV. The frequency of TTV DNA 
      increases with age. Polish TTV isolates are highly polymorphic and are classified as 
      1b, 2b and 2c.

TI  - Detection of TT virus (TTV) by three frequently-used PCR methods targeting different 
      regions of viral genome in children with cryptogenic hepatitis, chronic B hepatitis 
      and hbs carriers.
PG  - 432-7
AB  - This study was designed so that three sensitive and widely-used polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) methods for the detection of TT virus or Torque Teno virus (TTV) 
      would be simultaneously applied to a large number of subjects to evaluate 
      performances of the various PCR protocols with different genotype sensitivities. 
      Sera were collected from 92 children admitted to Hacettepe University Ihsan 
      Doğramaci Children's Hospital Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit (17 cryptogenic 
      chronic hepatitis, 17 asymptomatic HBs carriers, 18 chronic HBV patients and 40 
      healthy children). TTV DNA was detected via nested N22, nested 3'-UTR and 5'-UTR 
      PCRs for all samples. Differences in TTV D N A detection prevalences were n o t 
      statistically significantbetween the study groups with all TTV DNA and liver enzyme 
      levels. A significant agreement between PCR methods that target UTR was observed. 
      TTV detection rate increased with age, suggesting a non-parenteral, environmental 
      exposure to the virus for the study population.

TI  - Hepatitis viruses (other than hepatitis B and C viruses) as causes of hepatocellular 
      carcinoma: an update.
PG  - 149-57
LID - 10.1111/jvh.12043 [doi]
AB  - Chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections are universally accepted as causes of 
      hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatitis A and E viruses cause only acute 
      self-limiting infections of the liver. Of the remaining hepatitis viruses - Delta 
      hepatitis, hepatitis G (GB-C), TT and SEN - all have at some time been incriminated 
      as causes of hepatocellular carcinoma. Delta hepatitis virus requires helper 
      functions from hepatitis B virus to become invasive. Chronic Delta/hepatitis B viral 
      co-infection runs a more severe course than that resulting from chronic hepatitis B 
      virus infection alone, with progression to cirrhosis being more likely and more 
      rapid. A substantial majority of the early studies did not find an increased 
      incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in co-infected individuals. But more recently, 
      an increased incidence of the tumour has been recorded more often than no increase. 
      Further studies are needed to draw a firm conclusion with regard to the 
      hepatocarcinogenic effect of dual Delta/hepatitis B virus co-infection. With one 
      exception, no published study (of 13) has incriminated chronic infection with 
      hepatitis G virus as a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. The dissenting study, 
      published in 1999, was the only one performed in the United States. Fewer studies of 
      the hepatocarcinogenic effect of TT virus have been performed. Apart from one study, 
      published in 1999, no convincing evidence is available that supports a causal role 
      for TT virus in hepatocarcinogenesis. The exception was in Japanese patients with 
      high hepatitis C viral loads but independent of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. 
      No evidence has been produced to indicate that SEN virus causes hepatocellular 
      carcinoma.

TI  - Torque Teno virus in children who underwent orthotopic liver transplantation: new 
      insights about a common pathogen.
PG  - 247-54
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jit423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND:  Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous infectious agent. Transplant 
      recipients are at risk of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and could be vulnerable 
      to TTV-associated adverse effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the 
      influence of immunosuppression and HEV infection on TTV replication and liver injury 
      in pediatric patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). METHODS: 
       Pediatric recipients of liver transplants were classified into the following 2 
      groups: (1) those with normal serum aminotransferases levels and (2) those with 
      persistently increased serum aminotransferases levels and histological features of 
      chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology. The TTV load was assessed in 342 serum 
      samples by use of TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction, along with TTV 
      genogroups and coinfection with HEV. RESULTS:  TTV DNA was detected in 96% of tested 
      serum samples. Viral load was significantly lower in patients with features of 
      chronic hepatitis, of whom 78% had liver fibrosis scores of ≥2. Viral load decreased 
      during posttransplantation follow-up. Viral load and genogroups were influenced by 
      immunosuppression. Lower viral load was observed in patients coinfected with HEV. 
      CONCLUSIONS:  TTV infection is widespread, and its replication is closely related to 
      immune status and viral coinfection. High TTV viremia is not associated with 
      hepatitis after OLT, but, conversely, liver inflammatory activity impairs TTV 
      replication.

AB  - Environmental factors are capable of triggering the expression of human endogenous 
      retroviruses and induce an autoimmune response. Infection can promote the expression 
      of human endogenous retroviruses by molecular mimicry or by functional mimicry. 
      There are additional mechanisms which may control the expression of human endogenous 
      retroviruses, such as epigenetic status of the genome (hypomethylation, histone 
      deacetylation). Ultraviolet exposure, chemicals/drugs, injury/stress, hormones, all 
      as a single cause or in a concert, may modulate the involvement of human endogenous 
      retroviruses in pathogenic processes. In the current review we summarize the current 
      knowledge on infections, molecular mimicry, cross-reactivity and epigenetics 
      contribution for trigger human endogenous retroviruses expression and pathogenesis 
      in lupus patients.

AB  - PURPOSE: To test the hypothesis that uncultured organisms may be present in cases of 
      culture-negative endophthalmitis by use of deep DNA sequencing of vitreous biopsies. 
      DESIGN: Single-center, consecutive, prospective, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: 
      Aqueous or vitreous biopsies from 21 consecutive patients presenting with presumed 
      infectious endophthalmitis and 7 vitreous samples from patients undergoing surgery 
      for noninfectious retinal disorders. METHODS: Traditional bacterial and fungal 
      culture, 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and a representational 
      deep-sequencing method (biome representational in silico karyotyping [BRiSK]) were 
      applied in parallel to samples to identify DNA sequences corresponding to potential 
      pathogens. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Presence of potential pathogen DNA in ocular 
      samples. RESULTS: Zero of 7 control eyes undergoing routine vitreous surgery yielded 
      positive results for bacteria or virus by culture or 16S polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR). A total of 14 of the 21 samples (66.7%) from eyes harboring suspected 
      infectious endophthalmitis were culture-positive, the most common being 
      Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species. There was good agreement among culture, 
      16S bacterial PCR, and BRiSK methodologies for culture-positive cases (Fleiss' kappa 
      of 0.621). 16S PCR did not yield a recognizable pathogen sequence in any 
      culture-negative sample, whereas BRiSK suggested the presence of Streptococcus in 1 
      culture-negative sample. With the use of BRiSK, 57.1% of culture-positive and 100% 
      of culture-negative samples demonstrated the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) 
      sequences, compared with none in the controls (P=0.0005, Fisher exact test). The 
      presence of TTV viral DNA was confirmed in 7 cases by qPCR. No other known viruses 
      or potential pathogens were identified in these samples. CONCLUSIONS: Culture, 16S 
      qPCR, and BRiSK provide complementary information in presumed infectious 
      endophthalmitis. The majority of culture-negative endophthalmitis samples did not 
      contain significant levels of bacterial DNA. "Culture negativity" does not seem to 
      be due to failure of growth of fastidious bacteria. The small DNA virus TTV was 
      unexpectedly found in all culture-negative samples and some culture-positive 
      samples. This study cannot distinguish whether TTV is a direct intraocular pathogen, 
      an adjuvant for inflammation, a general marker of inflammation, or a commensal virus 
      but provides a testable hypothesis for a pathogenic mechanism in culture-negative 
      endophthalmitis.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus as a Novel Biomarker Targeting the Efficacy of Immunosuppression 
      After Lung Transplantation.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small DNA-viruses, of the genus Alphatorquevirus, 
      whose replication is linked to immune status. TTV load may be an indicator for 
      efficacy of IS in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). In a prospective 
      single-center-study 143 LTRs were followed up and tested by quantitative TTV-DNA 
      PCR. Using multivariate Cox-regression contribution of TTV-load to the occurrence of 
      severe infections, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), acute cellular 
      rejection (ACR), and death was assessed. During follow-up 28 (20%) patients 
      developed infections with a rate of 7.7 per 100 patient-years (PY). The hazard-ratio 
      (HR) associated with a one-log10 increase of TTV-load before the event was 5.05. 
      CLAD occurred with a rate of 6.0%-PY. HR for a 1 log10 increase of the lowest TTV 
      level before the event was 0.71 (CI: 0.54-0.93). TTV-load predicts clinical events 
      and may be useful to optimize IS during the first years of follow-up of LTRs.

TI  - Transfusion transmitted virus infection in patients on maintenance haemodialysis and 
      in hospital workers.
PG  - 277-81
AB  - A newly discovered DNA virus, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), was isolated from 
      a post-transfusional hepatitis patient in Japan. A high prevalence (32-46%) of TTV 
      infections in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis (HD) has been reported 
      but the occupational risk of TTV on HD units has not yet been determined. We 
      determined the prevalence of TTV in workers in the same HD unit and the risk factors 
      for TTV infection in HD patients, using logistic regression analysis. The prevalence 
      of TTV DNA was 59.6% in 198 HD patients, significantly higher than that in the HD 
      unit (13 of 39, 33.3%;P= 0.002) and non-HD healthcare workers (20 of 75, 26.7%; P= 
      0.001). A logistic regression analysis showed that male gender and negative test 
      results for hepatitis G virus RNA were risk factors for TTV infection, but prior 
      blood transfusion and duration of HD were not. Stepwise selection of multiple 
      regression analysis showed that the presence of hepatitis C virus RNA was the only 
      significant predictor for high serum ALT activity, and that the presence of TTV DNA 
      was not. These results indicate that TTV is one of the prevalent human viruses 
      transmissible either parenterally or nonparenterally in HD patients, but the 
      occupational risk of TTV infection in HD unit workers is as low as in other 
      healthcare workers. The pathogenic effects of TTV on the liver appear to be limited.

TI  - Effectiveness of nanofiltration in removing small non-enveloped viruses from three 
      different plasma-derived products.
PG  - 213-7
LID - 10.1111/j.1365-3148.2009.00931.x [doi]
AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the ability of nanofiltration of albumin 
      solution, prothrombin complex (PTC) and factor IX (FIX) to remove two small, 
      non-enveloped DNA viruses, parvovirus B19 (B19V) and torque teno virus (TTV). Virus 
      removal was investigated with down-scale experiments performed with sequential steps 
      of 35-nm and 15-nm nanofiltrations of products spiked with virus DNA-positive sera. 
      Viral loads were determined by real-time PCRs. The 15-nm nanofiltration removed more 
      than 4.0 B19V log from all the products, TTV was reduced of more than 3.0 log from 
      albumin solution and FIX by 35-nm and 15-nm nanofiltrations, respectively, being 
      viral DNA undetectable after these treatments. Traces of TTV were still found in PTC 
      after the 15-nm nanofiltration. In conclusion, nanofiltration can be efficacious in 
      removing small naked viruses but, since viruses with similar features can 
      differently respond to the treatment, a careful monitoring of large-scale 
      nanofiltration should be performed.

TI  - [Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) and renal failure].
PG  - 176-82
AB  - In 1997, a new DNA virus, designated TTV "Transfusion Transmitted Virus", was 
      isolated and seemed to be associated with non A-G post-transfusion hepatitis. The 
      virus infects mainly patients at risk for parenteral exposure and hence, prone to 
      develop chronic liver disease, as well as healthy populations worldwide. Few 
      reports, however, have been published on the epidemiology and potential significance 
      of TTV infection in patients with renal disease. This paper reviews, 
      characterization of the virus, the history of its discovery, taxonomy and 
      identification. Current status of TTV infection in patients with renal diseases are 
      also summarised.

TI  - High detection rates of Torque teno sus virus in co-infection with important viral 
      pathogens in porcine kidneys on St. Kitts Island, Lesser Antilles.
PG  - 1175-1181
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12960 [doi]
AB  - We report here high rates of detection (50.8%, 31/61 pigs) of Torque teno sus virus 
      (TTSuV) in kidneys of slaughter-age, apparently healthy pigs on St. Kitts island, 
      Lesser Antilles. TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a were detected in 23 (37.7%) and 13 (21.3%) 
      pigs, respectively, including mixed infection in five animals. By nucleotide 
      sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, significant genetic diversity was 
      observed among both TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a on St. Kitts, with TTSuVk2a showing higher 
      genetic diversity than TTSuV1. Fourteen (45.2%) and 10 (32.2%) of the TTSuV infected 
      pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine parvovirus 
      (PPV), respectively, revealing high rates of co-infection of TTSuV with PCV2 and 
      PPV. This is the first report on detection and genetic diversity of TTSuV from the 
      Lesser Antilles. Also, PCV2 and PPV were detected for the first time in the Lesser 
      Antilles. Considering the impact of pig farming on the regional livestock economy, 
      the increasing demand for local pork and lack of information on emerging and 
      re-emerging porcine viruses in the Lesser Antilles, the present findings have 
      important implications on swine health.

TI  - Effects of multiple virus coinfections on disease progression in HIV-positive 
      patients.
PG  - 105-13
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Since virus infections in AIDS patients are mostly inevitable and as they 
      frequently cause disease deterioration and therapeutic failures, a comprehensive 
      investigation was made of the influence of the coinfections of 9 well-known viruses 
      on disease progression in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 
      (HIV). METHODS: A cross-sectional study of 62 HIV-positive patients was conducted to 
      correlate the prevalence rates for the 9 viruses with the alanine aminotransferase 
      (ALT) levels and CD4 cell counts of the patients. RESULTS: The rates of HIV-positive 
      patients infected with the 9 viruses are significantly higher than those of the 
      control groups. Furthermore, almost one third of the patients in the studied group 
      was coinfected with transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) and manifested significantly 
      higher ALT levels (p = 0.020), and these were raised further if coinfection with TTV 
      and human hepatitis C virus had occurred (p = 0.010). By analyzing CD4 cell counts, 
      the only significant effect on AIDS progression which could be detected was 
      coinfection with human herpesvirus 8. CONCLUSION: This result confirmed that 
      immune-suppressed persons are more vulnerable to common virus infections. Unlike 
      hepatitis B or C virus, TTV seems to accelerate the progression of chronic hepatitis 
      in HIV-infected patients.

TI  - [Detection of porcine Circovirus type 2 and Torque-Teno-Sus-virus 1 and 2 in semen 
      samples of boars from an Austrian artificial insemination centre].
PG  - 201-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and torque-teno-sus- viruses (TTSuV) 
      are ubiquitous in all pig-producing countries. Both pathogens are transmitted 
      horizontally as well as vertically, and semen could be an important means of 
      transmission. Aim of this study was the investigation of the prevalence of these two 
      viruses in boar semen. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Single semen samples from 100 boars 
      from an artificial insemination centre were analysed by quantitative real time PCR 
      for PCV2 and by conventional PCR for TTSuV-1 and TTSuV-2. RESULTS: Only one Piétrain 
      boar of age of 47months showed a measurable PCV-2 quantity of 7.56x10³/ml semen. 
      Four samples were PCR-positive for TTSuV-1, and five for TTVSu-2, while in a single 
      co-infection both TTSuVs were detected.All TTSuV-positive samples originated from 
      Piétrain boars. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This study represents the first 
      description of TTSuV presence in semen in Austria. The prevalence of TTSuV as well 
      as PCV-2 was low. The clinical relevance of a simultaneous contamination of boar 
      semen with both pathogens remains unclear.

TI  - Detection of Torque teno sus virus types 1 and 2 by nested polymerase chain reaction 
      in sera of sows at parturition and of their newborn piglets immediately after birth 
      without suckling colostrum and at 24 hr after suckling colostrum.
PG  - 315-9
AB  - This study was performed to clarify the sow-to-fetus transmission pathway of Torque 
      teno sus virus (TTSuV) types 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). For this purpose, detection 
      of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 (TTSuVs) in sera of 6 sows (Sows 1-6) at parturition and in 
      sera of their newborn piglets immediately after birth without suckling colostrum was 
      performed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). These sows were bred using 
      semen that had tested negative for TTSuVs. In a TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-positive sow (Sow 
      1), TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were detected in 4 and 5 of 12 newborn littermates, 
      respectively. In a TTSuV1-positive sow (Sow 2), TTSuV1 was detected in 1 of 8 
      newborn littermates. In 4 TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-negative sows (Sows 3-6), TTSuV1 was 
      detected in 6 out of the 25 newborn piglets of 3 sows (Sows 3-5), while TTSuVs were 
      not detected in all 13 piglets of 1 sow (Sow 6). In addition, to investigate the 
      possibility of a sow-to-piglet transmission pathway of TTSuV via colostrum, TTSuV1 
      and TTSuV2 in sera of 12 newborn piglets from Sows 1-3 were examined by nPCR. 
      Immediately after birth without suckling colostrum, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were not 
      detected in 10 and 8 of 12 newborn piglets, respectively; however, at 24 hr after 
      suckling colostrum, TTSuV1 was detected in 6 piglets, while TTSuV2 was not detected 
      in any piglets. These results confirmed the existence of a sow-to-fetus transmission 
      pathway of TTSuV during normal pregnancy and suggested a possibility of 
      sow-to-piglet transmission of TTSuV via colostrum.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus prevalence in Turkish patients with thalassemia.
PG  - 347-53
AB  - In hematology patients on chronic transfusion regimes, liver diseases are frequent, 
      and mostly related to the agents transmitted by blood products and concominant iron 
      deposition in liver. Besides hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, new viral agents 
      like hepatitis G virus (HGV) and TorqueTeno virus (TTV) are identified in these 
      patients, although their association with any pathology or disease is not yet 
      proved. In the present work, the authors studied the clinical importance of TTV in 
      Turkish multitransfused patients with thalassemia. Forty-six healthy and 57 
      thalassemic patients were enrolled in the study. TTV was detected in serum samples 
      by 3'-UTR nested PCR. Transaminase and ferritin levels, hepatitis B and C virus 
      markers and number of transfusions were interpreted for possible association with 
      TTV infection. As a result, TTV was detected in 63% of the thalassemia and 54% of 
      the control patients. Prevalence of TTV infection, clinical features, laboratory 
      data, and annual transfusion numbers of TTV-positive and -negative patients were not 
      observed to be statistically significant. In conclusion, in Turkish patients with 
      thalassemia, TTV infection cannot be considered as a risk factor for liver disease.

TI  - Comparison of DNA and RNA extraction methods for mummified tissues.
PG  - 445-51
AB  - Nucleic acids extracted from mummified tissues are valuable materials for the study 
      of ancient human beings. Significant difficulty in extracting nucleic acids from 
      mummified tissues has been reported due to chemical modification and degradation. 
      The goal of this study was to determine a method that is more efficient for DNA and 
      RNA extraction from mummified tissues. Twelve mummy specimens were analyzed with 9 
      different nucleic acid extraction methods, including guanidium thiocyanate (GTC) and 
      proteinase K/detergent based methods prepared in our laboratory or purchased. 
      Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA and beta-actin RNA were used as markers 
      for the presence of adequate DNA and RNA, respectively, for PCR and RT-PCR 
      amplification. Our results show that 5 M GTC is more efficient of releasing nucleic 
      acids from mummified tissue than proteinase K/detergent, and phenol/chloroform 
      extraction with an additional chloroform step is more efficient than 
      phenol/chloroform along. We were able to isolate DNAs from all 12 specimens and RNAs 
      from 8 of 12 specimens, and the nucleic acids were sufficient for PCR and RT-PCR 
      analysis. We further tested hepatitis viruses including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis 
      C virus, hepatitis G virus, and TT virus DNA, and fail to detect these viruses in 
      all 12 specimens.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTV) 
      species in pig foetuses in order to assess the possible relationship between swine 
      TTV infection and abortion in swine. A total of 98 abortion cases and foetuses 
      collected from 55 pregnant sows at slaughterhouse were analysed by PCR for the 
      presence of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTV2). All 
      foetuses were necropsied and relevant tissues were collected, pooled, and submitted 
      to DNA extraction. The overall prevalence of swine TTV1 and TTV2 in aborted foetuses 
      (n = 98) was 17.0% and 29.6%, respectively. For slaughterhouse collected foetuses (n 
      = 55), 10.9% were TTV1 PCR positive and 40.0% were positive for TTV2. There were no 
      statistically significant differences when comparing prevalence of swine TTVs by 
      type of sample (aborted versus slaughterhouse collected foetuses) or by gestation 
      stage. The present work represents the first description of swine TTV infection in 
      pig foetuses at different stages of gestation. Results obtained confirm that 
      vertical transmission is an important route of TTVs dissemination. In addition, data 
      obtained suggest that swine TTVs should not be considered as infectious agents 
      responsible for abortion occurrence.

PG  - 142-7
AB  - In the present retrospective study, serum samples from a total of 253 pigs of 
      different age groups from 83 farms collected in the year 2008 were included.The sera 
      were analysed for the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2. 
      Furthermore, the correlation between TTV and PCV-2 was investigated. 62.1% of the 
      pigs were positive for TTV1 and/or TTV2 by PCR. 21.7% of the samples were positive 
      for TTV1 and TTV2, 16.2% only for TTV1 and 23.3% only for TTV2. In 80.7% of the 
      investigated farms at least one animal was TTV positive. In the growing and 
      fattening period significantly more pigs were positive for TTV than in other age 
      classes. A positive association was found between TTV1 and IgM against PCV-2, 
      between TTV2 and PCV-2 results by in situ hybridisation (ISH) as well as TTV1 and 
      TTV2 and PCV-2 results by qPCR. A significant correlation could also be seen between 
      the diagnosis,porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC)" and the detection of TTV, 
      whereas there was none to the diagnosis "porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome 
      (PDNS)". In the present study, TTV was detected in Austria for the first time.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus for Risk Stratification of Acute Biopsy-Proven Alloreactivity in 
      Kidney Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 1934-1939
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiz039 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Drug-induced immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients is 
      crucial to prevent allograft rejection, but increases risk for infectious disease. 
      Immunologic monitoring to tailor immunosuppressive drugs might prevent 
      alloreactivity and adverse effects simultaneously. The apathogenic torque teno virus 
      (TTV) reflects the immunocompetence of its host and might act as a potential 
      candidate for a holistic monitoring. METHODS: We screened all 1010 consecutive 
      patients from the prospective Vienna Kidney Transplant Cohort Study for availability 
      of allograft biopsies and adequately stored sera for TTV quantification by 
      polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Patients with acute biopsy-proven alloreactivity 
      according to the Banff classification (n = 33) showed lower levels of TTV in the 
      peripheral blood compared to patients without rejection (n = 80) at a median of 43 
      days before the biopsy. The risk for alloreactivity decreased by 10% per log level 
      of TTV copies/mL (risk ratio, .90 [95% confidence interval, .84-.97]; P = .005). TTV 
      levels >1 × 106 copies/mL exclude rejection with a sensitivity of 94%. Multivariable 
      generalized linear modeling suggests an independent association between TTV level 
      and alloreactivity. CONCLUSIONS: TTV is a prospective biomarker for risk 
      stratification of acute biopsy-proven alloreactivity in kidney transplant recipients 
      and might be a potential tool to tailor immunosuppressive drug therapy.

TI  - Efficient surveillance of pig populations using oral fluids.
PG  - 292-300
LID - 10.1016/j.prevetmed.2011.11.008 [doi]
AB  - Currently virus surveillance in swine herds is constrained by the cost-effectiveness 
      and efficiency of sampling methods. The objective of this study was to assess the 
      value of using oral fluids collected by barn personnel as a method of surveillance 
      based on PCR testing. Approximately 12,150 pigs in 10 wean-to-finish barns on 10 
      farms were monitored for the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine 
      reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and 
      Torque teno virus genogroups 1 (TTV1) and 2 (TTV2) by sampling oral fluid specimens. 
      Oral fluid samples were collected from 6 pens at each site starting at the time of 
      pig placement (∼3 weeks of age) and continuing thereafter at 2-week intervals for a 
      period of 18 weeks. Data were analyzed both on a pen basis and barn basis. Overall, 
      508 (85%) samples were positive for PCV2, 73 (12%) for PRRSV, 46 (8%) for IAV, 483 
      (81%) for TTV2, and 155 (26%) for TTV1 during the study period. The estimated 
      arithmetic means of the quantitative PCR-positive oral fluids for PCV2, PRRSV, and 
      IAV were 1×10(4.62), 1×10(4.97), and 1×10(5.49)per ml. With a single exception, all 
      barns were positive for PCV2 and TTV2 at every sampling point in the study. Virus 
      detection varied among barns, particularly for IAV and PRRSV. The pen level, 
      cumulative distribution of agent combinations between all 10 barns were 
      statistically different. The most commonly observed patterns were PCV2+TTV2 (239 pen 
      samples, 40%), PCV2+TTV1+TTV2 (88 pen samples, 15%), and PCV2 alone (66 pen samples, 
      11%). This "proof-of-concept" project showed that a variety of viruses could be 
      detected either intermittently or continuously in pig populations and demonstrated 
      that barn herd virus status is highly variable, even among barns in the same 
      production system. Oral fluid sampling is a promising approach for increasing the 
      efficiency and cost effectiveness of virus surveillance in swine herds.

TI  - Red meat consumption and cancer: reasons to suspect involvement of bovine infectious 
      factors in colorectal cancer.
PG  - 2475-83
LID - 10.1002/ijc.27413 [doi]
AB  - An increased risk for colorectal cancer has been consistently reported for long-time 
      consumption of cooked and processed red meat. This has frequently been attributed to 
      chemical carcinogens arising during the cooking process of meat. Long-time fish or 
      poultry consumption apparently does not increase the risk, although similar or 
      higher concentrations of chemical carcinogens were recorded in their preparation for 
      consumption. The geographic epidemiology of colorectal cancer seems to correspond to 
      regions with a high rate of beef consumption. Countries with a virtual absence of 
      beef in the diet (India) or where preferably lamb or goat meat is consumed (several 
      Arabic countries) reveal low rates of colorectal cancer. In China, pork consumption 
      has a long tradition, with an intermediate colorectal cancer rate. In Japan and 
      Korea, large scale beef and pork imports started after World War II or after the 
      Korean War. A steep rise in colorectal cancer incidence was noted after 1970 in 
      Japan and 1990 in Korea. The consumption of undercooked beef (e.g., shabu-shabu, 
      Korean yukhoe and Japanese yukke) became very popular in both countries. The 
      available data are compatible with the interpretation that a specific beef factor, 
      suspected to be one or more thermoresistant potentially oncogenic bovine viruses 
      (e.g., polyoma-, papilloma- or possibly single-stranded DNA viruses) may contaminate 
      beef preparations and lead to latent infections in the colorectal tract. Preceding, 
      concomitant or subsequent exposure to chemical carcinogens arising during cooking 
      procedures should result in increased risk for colorectal cancer synergistic with 
      these infections.

AB  - Alterations of B cell subpopulations have been described up to date as 
      characterizing advanced stage of HIV-1 infection. However, whether such defects are 
      relevant in subjects with a preserved number of CD4⁺ T cells (>350 cells/μL) is 
      unclear. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated if signs of B cells exhaustion 
      and impaired viral immune surveillance are present in a cohort of 43 asymptomatic 
      HIV-1-infected patients with preserved CD4⁺ T cell counts (>350 cells/μL) and highly 
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) untreated. A dramatic expansion of exhausted 
      tissue-like memory B cells (CD10⁻CD21(low)CD27⁻) was observed. B cells alteration 
      was related to an increase in Torque teno virus (TTV) load, used as surrogate marker 
      of immune function. Successfully HAART-treated patients showed normalization of B 
      cell subpopulations frequency and TTV load. These results provide new insights on B 
      cell in HIV-1 infection and show that development of B cell abnormalities precedes 
      CD4⁺ T cell decline.

TI  - Detection of SENV Virus in Healthy, Hepatitis B- and Hepatitis C-Infected 
      Individuals in Yazd Province, Iran.
PG  - 168-74
AB  - BACKGROUND: SEN virus (SENV) is the latest virus proposed as a cause of unknown 
      hepatitis cases. Among nine detected genotypes of the virus, genotypes D and H are 
      more frequent in hepatitis cases of unknown origin. The aim of this study was to 
      determine the frequency of SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes in the sera of healthy 
      individuals and hepatitis B and C patients. METHODS: Totally, 200 serum samples from 
      healthy individuals as well as 50 hepatitis B and 50 hepatitis C patients were 
      collected. Anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus), anti-human immunodeficiency virus, 
      hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HBV (hepatitis B virus) core antigen were 
      detected, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST) were measured. Viral DNA was subjected to nested PCR. Fisher's exact and 
      unpaired ANOVA tests were used for statistical analyses. RESULTS: SENV was detected 
      in 90%, 66%, and 46% of the healthy individuals HBV and HCV-positive individuals, 
      respectively. The frequency of SENV and its two genotypes were significantly lower 
      in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients (P<0.01). Also, the frequency of SENV-H was 
      higher than SENV-D in all studied groups. In SENV-positive HBV patients, the level 
      of ALT and AST enzymes were significantly less than SENV-negative patients (P<0.05). 
      It was the same for SENV-H-negative and -positive cases. CONCLUSIONS: The levels of 
      liver enzymes were significantly lower in HBV patients co-infected with SENV 
      compared to HBV patients (P<0.05), indicating a positive impact of the virus in 
      liver pathology by decreasing liver damage and thus decreasing the liver enzymes.

PG  - 327-330
LID - 10.1111/tbed.12792 [doi]
AB  - In this study, the co-infection of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) and porcine 
      circovirus type 3 (PCV3) was reported. One hundred and ten of 132 (83.3%) 
      PCV3-positive samples were co-infected with Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1). 
      Ninety-four of 132 (71.2%) PCV3-positive samples were co-infected with Torque teno 
      sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). Sixty-six of 132 (50.0%) of PCV3-positive samples were 
      co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. There were no clinical signs of infection 
      in pigs that were both PCV3-positive and PCV2-negative, in either multiparous sows 
      or live-born infants. The high co-infection rate provides valuable information for 
      the further study of the pathological correlation between PCV3 and TTSuVs.

AB  - Sera and selected tissue homogenates collected from gnotobiotic swine never exposed 
      to the environment or other swine tissues were tested for the presence of porcine 
      torque teno virus (TTV) DNAs by nested and non-nested polymerase chain reactions 
      (PCR) using primers specific for the untranslated region of porcine genogroups (g) 1 
      and 2. Twenty-three of 105 (21.9%) gnotobiotic piglets were g1- and/or g2-TTV DNA 
      positive. Twenty-three of 27 (85.2%) sow sera, collected at the time of Caesarian 
      derivation of the litters contained either or both TTV genogroup DNAs. These data 
      demonstrate that porcine TTV may be transmitted to piglets by the in utero route and 
      that the incidence of fetal infection is high.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first isolated in 1997 from the patient with acute 
      post-transfusion hepatitis. This fact led to the conclusion that the virus was 
      hepatotropic and could be one of the causative agents of acute hepatitis. 
      Afterwards, however, the virus was found in other human tissues and serological 
      studies revealed that it was widespread. Multiple tropisms of TTV and the fact of 
      its high incidence in general population are considered to indicate no medical 
      significance of TTV in human pathology. Here we present a report of two cases of TTV 
      infection in patients who developed pancreas cancer. The patients were hospitalized 
      at the Department of Infectious Diseases due to hepatitis of unknown origin. Since 
      serological and virological markers of common primary and secondary hepatotropic 
      viruses were negative, TTV-DNA was found in serum and was believed to be the only 
      causative agent with probable hepatotropic action. The patients later developed 
      pancreas cancer and they underwent operation. The relationship is difficult to 
      confirm, however the cases we present should be treated as a preliminary report and 
      a comment on the real role of TTV in human pathology.

TI  - TT virus genotype changes frequently in multiply transfused patients with hemophilia 
      but rarely in patients with chronic hepatitis C and in healthy subjects.
PG  - 1130-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus, was originally thought to be 
      transmitted by transfusion. However, nonparenteral transmission is recently 
      suspected to be a major mode of transmission. To investigate the possibility of 
      reinfection with TTV in multiply transfused patients and to evaluate the 
      significance of transfusion transmission of TTV in patients with hemophilia, serial 
      changes in TTV genotype were investigated in three groups. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: 
      Serial changes in TTV genotype were investigated in 16 multiply transfused patients 
      with hemophilia, 16 age-matched patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 16 
      age-matched healthy subjects. RESULTS: Mixed infection with multiple TTV genotypes 
      was common in all groups. However, changes in TTV genotype were frequent in patients 
      with hemophilia (15/16; 93.8%) but rare in patients with chronic hepatitis C and in 
      healthy subjects (each group: 1/16; 6.3%). CONCLUSION: Changes in TTV genotype were 
      frequently observed in multiply transfused patients with hemophilia but not in 
      patients with chronic hepatitis or in healthy subjects without risk of transfusion 
      transmission. This difference may suggest that exposure to TTV or even reinfection 
      occurs frequently in patients with hemophilia, which could be evidence of 
      transfusion transmission of TTV in this population.

TI  - High Prevalence of Torque teno (TT) virus in classical Kaposi's sarcoma.
PG  - 14-7
AB  - Human herpes virus 8 infection is the primary and necessary factor in the 
      development of Kaposi's sarcoma, but is not sufficient per se to trigger the onset 
      of the disease. In order to search for virological cofactors associated with the 
      occurrence of the disease, we investigated the prevalence of active infection by two 
      newly discovered viruses, hepatitis G virus and TT virus, among patients with 
      classical Kaposi's sarcoma. Serum of 24 patients with Mediterranean Kaposi's sarcoma 
      was investigated using polymerase chain reaction and compared with that of 68 
      healthy subjects. Cutaneous samples from patients with Kaposi's sarcoma and healthy 
      subjects were investigated for TT virus DNA. No patient had serum markers for 
      hepatitis G virus. TT virus DNA was present in the serum of 21/24 (87.5%) patients 
      and 32/68 (47%) controls (p=0.002). TT virus DNA was present in the lesional skin of 
      5/18 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (27.7%), but not in the skin of controls. TT 
      virus might play a role as a cofactor in the clinical emergence of Kaposi's sarcoma 
      in patients infected with Human herpes virus 8, perhaps by immunosuppressive effects 
      or by a common transmission pathway for these two viruses.

TI  - TT virus infection in patients with fulminant hepatic failure.
PG  - 3602-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A new DNA virus, which has been designated the TT virus, was discovered 
      in 1997. It is not clear whether TT virus is a cause of any of the types of 
      hepatitis. We conducted a case-control study to test the hypothesis that the 
      presence of TT virus is a necessary condition for the development of fulminant 
      hepatic failure in people who have non-A, -B, or -C hepatitis. METHODS: We studied 
      55 patients with fulminant hepatic failure [28 men, 27 women, mean (+/- SD) age, 47 
      +/- 15 yr], 32 patients with acute hepatitis (18 men, 14 women, mean age, 38 +/- 15 
      yr), and 200 healthy subjects (106 men, 94 women, mean age, 42 +/- 14 yr). TT virus 
      DNA was detected in sera by a nested polymerase chain reaction using a primer set 
      for genotype 1. RESULTS: TT virus was more frequently detected in patients with 
      fulminant hepatic failure [in 33 of 55 (60%); 95% confidence interval (CI), 47-73%] 
      than in those with acute hepatitis [in 8 of 32 (25%); 95% CI, 10-40%; p = 0.0016] or 
      in healthy subjects [in 50 of 200 (25%); 95% CI, 19-31%; p < 0.0001]. TT virus was 
      detected at a significantly higher rate in non-A, -B, or -C fulminant hepatic 
      failure [in 18 of 22 (82%); 95% CI, 66-98%] than in fulminant hepatic failure of A, 
      B, or C type [45%, 28-62%, 15/33; p = 0.007] or in non-A, -B, or -C acute hepatitis 
      [24%, 3-44%, 4/17; p = 0.0003]. The logistic regression analysis selected TT virus 
      (p = 0.0009), age (p = 0.0116), and etiology (p = 0.0309) as independent variables 
      associated with fulminant hepatic failure (coefficient of determination, 0.2335). 
      CONCLUSIONS: TT virus comparatively plays a role in the pathogenesis of non-A, -B, 
      or -C fulminant hepatic failure.

TI  - [TT virus and hepatitis G virus in different risk groups in Afyon].
PG  - 61-7
AB  - The main transmission route of TT virus (Transfusion-Transmitted Virus, TTV) and 
      hepatitis G virus (HGV) is by parenteral route of blood and blood-products. Since 
      they form the same risk group, some of TTV or HGV positive patients may also be 
      infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV). In this study, 
      the presence of TTV and HGV has been investigated by reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection 
      System, AB), in 40 hepatitis B, 30 hepatitis C and 5 hepatitis B and C co-infected 
      patients, 50 HBV and HCV negative hemodialysis patients, and 50 randomly selected 
      healthy blood donors. As a result, 37 (21.1%) TTV and 11 (6.3%) HGV positivity were 
      detected, out of a total 175 cases. The positivity rates for TTV and HGV were found 
      as 40% and 5% in HBV-positive, 23.3% and 20% in HCV-positive, 20% and 20% in HBV+HCV 
      co-infected patients, 20% and 4% in hemodialysis patients, and 6% and 0% in healthy 
      blood donors, respectively. In conclusion, as the positivity rates were not low for 
      these viruses, their role on the hepatitis pathogenesis should be further 
      investigated by detailed studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Data regarding the influence of the APOBEC3B deletion on infectious 
      diseases remain limited and shown discrepancies. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the 
      APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism status and its association with prevalence of 
      co-infection with blood-borne pathogens in Indonesian HIV-infected individuals. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 597 HIV-positive blood samples were tested for the 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Torque Teno virus (TTV), GB 
      virus-C (GBV-C), and Toxoplasma gondii. Nucleic acid was extracted from plasma 
      samples and used for the molecular detection of HIV RNA, HBV DNA, HCV RNA, TTV DNA, 
      and GBV-C RNA, whereas HBsAg, anti-HCV, IgM and IgG anti-T. gondii were detected 
      through serological testing. The APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism was genotyped by 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: The deletion genotype was associated with 
      HCV viremia (p<0.001) as well as elevated IgG anti-T. gondii (adjusted OR 
      [aOR]=3.4). The deletion genotype was also associated with decreased levels of HBsAg 
      (aOR=0.03), and anti-HCV (aOR=0.1). D/D was frequently found in HIV-infected 
      individuals with CD4+T cells<14% (aOR=5.8). The intact genotype was associated with 
      a reduced likelihood of a CD4+T cell count<200 cells/μL (aOR=0.2) but a higher 
      prevalence of TTV co-infection (aOR=8.6). CONCLUSIONS: The APOBEC3B deletion 
      polymorphism was found to be associated with HBV, HCV, TTV, and T. gondii 
      co-infection in Indonesian HIV-infected individuals.

TI  - Prevalence and genotypic distribution of hepatitis GB-C/HG and TT viruses in blood 
      donors, mentally retarded children and four groups of patients in eastern Anatolia, 
      Turkey.
PG  - 222-7
AB  - We investigated the prevalence and genotypic distribution of GB virus-C/hepatitis G 
      virus (GBV-C/HGV) and TT virus (TTV) in blood donors, mentally retarded children and 
      four groups of patients living in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The prevalence and 
      genetic analysis of TTV were determined by using the primers of the UTR and ORF1 
      regions of TTV, respectively. Reverse transcription nested (RT-n)-PCR was used to 
      amplify 5' UTR of GBV-C/HGV. Genotyping of HGV was carried out by PCR-based 
      genotyping assay while RFLP was conducted to determine the genotypes of TTV. TTV DNA 
      was detected in 118 of 410 sera tested, giving an overall prevalence of 28.7%; 
      GBV-C/HGV-RNA was detected in only 17 cases, giving an overall prevalence of 4.1%. 
      No significant differences were observed in the number of positive or negative tests 
      for GBV-C/HGV and TTV according to duration of illness or mean duration of 
      institutionalization in any of the groups studied. Although all samples from the 
      study population belonged to genotypes 1 and 4, the most common TTV genotype is G2. 
      In conclusion, our results indicate a low endemicity of GBV-C/HGV and TTV infection 
      in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The presence of G2 strains reveals the limited genetic 
      diversity of the GBV-C/HGV circulating in Turkey. We suggest that TTV infection of 
      genotypes 1 and 4 is prevalent in the same region.

TI  - Pathogenic characterization of a cervical lymph node derived from a patient with 
      Kawasaki disease.
PG  - 814-23
AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common cause of multisystem vasculitis in 
      childhood. Although cervical lymphadenitis is one of the major symptoms in KD, lymph 
      node biopsy is rarely performed, because KD is usually diagnosed by clinical 
      symptoms. A cervical lymph node biopsy was taken from a girl aged 1 year and 8 
      months who had suspected lymphoma, but she was diagnosed with KD after the biopsy. 
      The cervical lymph node specimen was analyzed with multivirus real-time PCR that can 
      detect >160 viruses, and unbiased direct sequencing with a next-generation DNA 
      sequencer to detect potential pathogens in the lymph node. Histologically, focal 
      necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, including neutrophils and macrophages, 
      was observed in the marginal zone of the cervical lymph node, which was compatible 
      with the acute phase of KD. Multivirus real-time PCR detected a low copy number of 
      torque teno virus in the sample. Comprehensive direct sequencing of the cervical 
      lymph node biopsy sample sequenced more than 8 million and 3 million reads from DNA 
      and RNA samples, respectively. Bacterial genomes were detected in 0.03% and 1.79% of 
      all reads in DNA and RNA samples, respectively. Although many reads corresponded to 
      genomes of bacterial environmental microorganisms, Streptococcus spp. genome was 
      detected in both DNA (77 reads) and RNA (2,925 reads) samples. Further studies are 
      required to reveal any association of microbial or viral infection with the 
      pathogenesis of KD.

TI  - Heterogeneity of TT virus related sequences isolated from human tumour biopsy 
      specimens.
PG  - 44-50
AB  - TT viruses have recently been reported in serum samples from varying percentages of 
      human blood donors and in patients with chronic liver disease. However, no 
      association with human pathology has yet been reported. In a pilot study we analysed 
      162 biopsy specimens from various human cancers and from colon polyps for the 
      presence of TT virus related sequences by polymerase chain reaction using three sets 
      of nested primers for TT virus detection. All gels were subjected to Southern blot 
      hybridisation, and DNA from hybridising bands was cloned and sequenced. A total of 
      54.3% of tumour specimens contained identifiable TT virus related sequences. 
      Specimens from hypopharynx, larynx, endometrial, ovarian and bladder cancers were 
      14-35% positive and gastrointestinal cancers (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum) 
      and colon polyps 57-100% positive. Lung cancers (68.4%), mammary cancers (50%), 
      multiple myelomas (85.7%) and human leukaemias (53.3%) also revealed a high 
      prevalence of TT virus related sequences. Since normal control tissues were not 
      available for the tumour biopsy specimens tested, these data do not permit 
      conclusions concerning a possible causal relationship between the virus infections 
      and carcinogenesis. Another aspect, however, deserves attention: the heterogeneity 
      of TT virus clones obtained from the specimens tested here was striking: 66 novel 
      sequences, probably belonging to new types were identified. Only 16 clones 
      corresponded by more than 97% of their sequences to established prototypes. Even 
      individual tumours commonly contained sequences substantially diverging in nucleic 
      acid composition. Up to five different types were identified within an individual 
      tumour. The high variability of these virus types suggests that additional primer 
      combinations within the highly conserved region of the genome would detect a still 
      higher rate of positive tumours.

TI  - TT virus infection in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).
PG  - 80-7
AB  - TT virus is a novel hepatitis-associated DNA virus that has been provisionally 
      designated as transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV). Infection by TTV has been 
      frequently demonstrated in humans. Few reports, however, have been published on the 
      epidemiology of TTV infection in patients with ESRD. The prevalence of TTV in 
      patients undergoing maintenance dialysis varies widely and various demographic, 
      virologic or clinical features can explain these differences; in some series, the 
      prevalence of TTV in HD was significantly higher than in control groups. Blood 
      transfusion requirement and nosocomial transmission of TTV within dialysis units 
      seem to be important in the diffusion of TTV in the HD setting; however, other 
      routes of TTV acquisition may play a role. The clinical significance related to the 
      presence of TTV in HD population remains unclear; it is possible that TTV may 
      aggravate liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The natural 
      history of TTV in dialysis is an area of avide research, since TTV has a propensity 
      for establishing long-term infection in HD patients. The possibility that TTV causes 
      pathological changes outside the liver cannot be ruled out. Further studies are in 
      progress to understand the natural history and the epidemiology of TTV infection in 
      patients with ESRD.

TI  - Effect of multiple freezing and thawing of serum on TT virus and hepatitis B virus 
      DNA positivity.
PG  - 515-8
AB  - This study was done to determine the effect of freezing and thawing of serum on the 
      stability of TTV and HBV DNA levels. Seven TTV DNA positive samples were randomly 
      selected among the sera having HBV DNA with concentrations ranging from 12 pg/ml to 
      4162 pg/ml and they were frozen and thawed up to eight times and then analyzed for 
      changes on TTV- and HBV DNA levels. TTV DNA positivity and HBV DNA concentrations 
      were tested by using semi-nested PCR and Digene hybrid capture system, respectively. 
      Seven cycles of freezing and thawing did not significantly change HBV DNA 
      concentrations and TTV DNA positivity in any of the samples tested. After eight 
      cycles, only three samples were tested, and all were positive for HBV DNA, but 
      negative for TTV DNA. Our results show that both TTV- and HBV DNA positives 
      continued until the seventh cycle of freezing and thawing in all samples tested.

TI  - TT virus in hematological disorders and bone marrow transplant recipients.
PG  - 483-9
AB  - TT virus (TTV) was cloned as a possible causative agent for non A to C 
      posttransfusion hepatitis. Determination of the entire sequence of the virus 
      revealed that the virus is the first human circovirus. The nucleotide sequence of 
      TTV has a wide range of diversity and at least sixteen genotypes have been 
      discovered to date. The prevalence of TTV infection in the normal population differs 
      among countries, but exceeds 10% in several countries. Most of TTV infections are 
      not associated with hepatitis, although there is evidence of TTV-induced hepatitis, 
      especially caused by TTV of genotype I. To determine whether TTV is replicated in 
      the liver is important in order to show that TTV is really a hepatitis virus, 
      because results of a study in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients suggested that 
      TTV might be replicated mainly in the hematopoietic cells. The prevalence of TTV 
      infection in patients with hematological disorders who regularly require blood 
      products was extremely high, but most of the infections did not cause liver injury, 
      even in BMT recipients.

TI  - Detection of SEN virus in the general population and different risk groups in 
      Slovakia.
PG  - 223-8
AB  - Sera of 426 adult persons were examined to assess the prevalence of SEN virus (SENV) 
      infection in Slovakia and to determine the importance of different risk factors for 
      parenteral transmission. SENV prevalence was determined by the PCR method using 
      primers of SENV-D and SENV-H strains. Positive results were found in 10 of 37 
      patients with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology, 7 of 38 with acute hepatitis B, 
      17 of 44 with chronic hepatitis B, 29 of 102 with chronic hepatitis C, 36 of 72 
      hemodialysis patients, 2 of 33 health care workers and 24 of 100 persons from the 
      control group. The highest prevalence of SENV was among hemodialysis patients, 
      significantly higher than in the groups of health care workers, acute hepatitis B 
      and controls. The lowest prevalence was in health care workers group, significantly 
      lower also in comparison with groups of chronic hepatitis B and C. Among the 
      possible risk factors of virus transmission the average duration of hemodialysis 
      (1.15 vs. 0.50 years), number of surgeries (1.60 vs. 1.10) and transfusions (1.34 
      vs. 0.94) showed notable differences in terms of SENV infection. Bilirubin and 
      aminotransferase levels did not differ between SENV-positive and -negative groups. 
      No pathogenetic role of SEN virus in liver injury was confirmed.

TI  - Infection with hepatitis A and TT viruses and socioeconomic status in Rio de 
      Janeiro, Brazil.
PG  - 121-5
AB  - The prevalence of antibodies directed against the enterically transmitted hepatitis 
      A virus (HAV) was measured in 2 groups of people living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
      Of 1,056 health care workers (HCWs), 778 (73.7%) were anti-HAV positive. A high 
      prevalence of anti-HAV antibodies (85.7%) was also found among 274 voluntary blood 
      donors (BDs). TT virus (TTV) is a DNA virus that has been found in the sera of 
      patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. Occurrence of virus 
      shedding suggests that the fecal-oral route may be an important mode of TTV 
      transmission, particularly in the developing world. The presence of TTV DNA was 
      analyzed by PCR in the sera of 191 HCWs and 151 BDs. TTV was detected in 65.4% of 
      HCWs and 79.5% of BDs. In both groups, a family income of < US$400 per month and a 
      level of education of < 11 y of schooling were found to be risk factors for HAV 
      infection. Furthermore, a low family income was associated with TTV viremia in the 
      HCW group. However, the presence of TTV DNA was associated with neither low level of 
      education nor anti-HAV positivity.

TI  - HEV, TTV and GBV-C/HGV markers in patients with acute viral hepatitis.
PG  - 767-75
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of HEV, TTV and 
      GBV-C/GBV-C/HGV in patients with acute viral hepatitis A, B and non-A-C. We 
      evaluated sera of 94 patients from a sentinel program who had acute hepatitis A (N = 
      40), B (N = 42) and non-A-C (N = 12); 71 blood donors served as controls. IgM and 
      anti-HEV IgG antibodies were detected by enzyme immunoassay using commercial kits. 
      TTV and GBV-C/HGV were detected by nested PCR; genotyping was done by sequencing and 
      phylogenetic analysis. Anti-HEV IgG was present in 38, 10 and 17% of patients with 
      hepatitis A, B and non-A-C. Four patients with hepatitis A and 1 with non-A-C 
      hepatitis also had anti-HEV IgM detected in serum. TTV was detected in 21% of 
      patients with acute hepatitis and in 31% of donors. GBV-C/HGV was detected in 9% of 
      patients with hepatitis, and in 10% of donors. We found TTV isolates of genotypes 1, 
      2, 3, and 4 and GBV-C/HGV isolates of genotypes 1 and 2. Mean aminotransferase 
      levels were lower in patients who were TTV or GBV-C/HGV positive. In conclusion, the 
      detection of anti-HEV IgM in some acute hepatitis A cases suggests co-infection with 
      HEV and hepatitis E could be the etiology of a few cases of sporadic non-A-C 
      hepatitis in Salvador, Brazil. TTV genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 isolates and GBV-C/HGV 
      genotype 1 and 2 strains are frequent in the studied population. TTV and GBV-C/HGV 
      infection does not appear to have a role in the etiology of acute hepatitis.

TI  - Similar frequency of TT virus infection in patients with liver enzyme elevations and 
      healthy subjects.
PG  - 434-6
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a novel DNA virus that has been identified in patients with 
      post-transfusional hepatitis of unknown aetiology. However, its pathogenic role in 
      liver injury remains unclear. To determine its frequency and clinical impact in 
      cryptogenic liver diseases, we investigated the TTV prevalence in patients with 
      liver enzyme elevations of unknown aetiology and in healthy subjects. Fifty-four 
      patients (33 male, 21 female) who have been followed up for elevated ALT/AST levels 
      of unknown aetiology and 118 healthy subjects (99 male and 19 female) were included 
      in the study. TTV DNA was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction. Other 
      possible causes of transaminase elevation were excluded in detailed biochemical and 
      serological tests. A liver biopsy was performed in 45 patients. TTV DNA was detected 
      in 46 patients with liver enzyme elevations (85.1%) and in 94 healthy subjects 
      (79.6%). There was no statistical difference between the groups (p = 0.51). 
      Histological examination of the liver revealed no specific change in TTV DNA 
      positive patients that could be attributed to this virus infection. These results 
      showed that TTV is a common virus in patients with liver enzyme elevation of unknown 
      aetiology and even among healthy subjects in our geographical area. TTV infection is 
      therefore widespread in the general population and does not seem to be associated 
      with liver damage.

TI  - [Frequency of transfusion transmitted virus in healthy infants in Jiujiang city 
      Jiangxi province].
PG  - 54-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) DNA was detected in serum samples 
      obtained from healthy infants and volunteer blood donors living in Jiujiang city in 
      an attempt to shed light on the prevalence of TTV infection and the transmission 
      route of TTV infection in infants. METHODS: Modified untranslated region, polymerase 
      chain reaction (UTR PCR) and N22 PCR were performed to test TTV DNA in serum samples 
      from 86 infants and 58 blood donors. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected by UTR PCR in 51 
      (53.5%) infants and 58 (100%) in blood donors, while that tested by N22 PCR was 14 
      (16.3%) and 22 (37.3%) in infants and blood donors, respectively. Among infants 
      younger than 30 days, 1 - 6 months and 7 - 12 months of age, TTV DNA was detected by 
      UTR PCR and N22 PCR at rates of 0, 33.3%, 95.0% and 0, 7.4%, 30.0%, respectively. 
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of TTV DNA detected by UTR PCR were 95% in infants 
      of 7 - 12 months after birth and 100% in healthy blood donors in Jiujiang city. 
      However the results obtained by N22 PCR were much less frequently in the same 
      population. Results showed that significant difference did exist in the prevalence 
      of TTV DNA detected by the two different PCR systems. Age-dependent increase of TTV 
      infection was observed in early childhood, while environmental sources were 
      considered to be the most common route of TTV acquisition as the primary infection 
      in infants. However, the prevalence of TTV in infants of 7 - 12 months was similar 
      to that in healthy adults in the same region.

TI  - TT virus infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B and response of TTV to 
      lamivudine.
PG  - 1261-4
AB  - AIM: To investigate the responses of TT virus (TTV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) to a 
      long-term lamivudine therapy. METHODS: Sixteen patients infected with both TTV and 
      HBV were treated with lamivudine 100 mg daily for 30 months. Blood samples were 
      drawn at the beginning of the therapy and subsequently at month 3, 6, 9, 12 and 30. 
      Serum TTV was quantified by real time PCR and serum HBV was detected by 
      hybridization assay and nested polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: TTV infection was 
      detected in 100 % of HBV-infected patients. Loss of serum TTV DNA after one year of 
      treatment occurred in 1/16 (6 %) patients. At the end of therapy, TTV DNA was 
      positive in 94 % of them. The decline of HBV viremia was evident at 3 months after 
      therapy and the response rate was 31 %, 44 %, 63 %, 50 % and 50 % at month 3, 6, 9, 
      12 and 30, respectively. CONCLUSION: TTV replication is not sensitive to lamivudine 
      and is highly prevalent in HBV-infected patients.

TI  - Prevalence and Genotyping of Torque Teno Virus in HBV/HIV and Chronic HBV Patients 
      in Iran.
PG  - 338-44
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) was the first human Anelloviridae detected in a 
      Japanese patient with an unknown type of hepatitis in 1997. TTV is by far the first 
      known single-stranded circular DNA virus infecting human. In spite of its widespread 
      nature in human population, its pathogenesis is still unclear. In addition, 
      information regarding TTV infection in Iranian population is limited. Therefore, we 
      attempted to determine the prevalence and genotype of TTV in three groups: HIV/HBV 
      patients, chronic hepatitis B patients, and healthy individuals. METHODS: The 
      presence of TTV DNA in sera was investigated using PCR. The primer sets encompassing 
      two 5΄-UTR and N22 regions were used, and the positive products were collected for 
      sequencing. Phylogenetic tree was generated based on N22 region and using the MEGA 7 
      software. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 452 patients with HIV/HBV and chronic 
      hepatitis B, as well as in healthy control groups. The results from PCR indicated 
      positive rates for these three groups, 48%, 54%, and 49.3% using 5΄-UTR primer and 
      15.1%, 12%, and 8% using N22 primer, respectively. CONCLUSION: Five genogroups were 
      observed, which the second group was found to be the most frequent. The results of 
      5΄-UTR primer showed more prevalence of TTV DNA comparing to N22 primer in patients 
      and healthy control.

TI  - Detection rates of the swine torque teno viruses (TTVs), porcine circovirus type 2 
      (PCV2) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) in the livers of pigs with hepatitis.
PG  - 641-8
LID - 10.1007/s11259-010-9432-z [doi]
AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are the most recently 
      recognized causes of infectious hepatitis of pigs and may or may not act 
      independently in the development of the disease. Recently it has been suggested that 
      swine torque teno viruses (TTVs), in co-infections with some swine viral pathogens, 
      may potentiate the severity of disease. In order to search for virological cofactors 
      associated with infectious hepatitis in pigs, we investigated the liver tissues, to 
      determine the presence of TTVs, PCV2 and HEV of naturally infected pigs and analysed 
      the prevalence of both genogroups of the TTVs in the hepatitis lesions. 
      Histopathological techniques, nested-polymerase chain reactions (nPCRs), polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR) and one-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction 
      (RT-PCR) were applied to detect hepatitis lesions, TTVs genogroups 1 and 2, PCV2 and 
      HEV infection. Of the livers examined 58% (29/50) had mild to moderate hepatitis and 
      74% (37/50), 56% (28/50) and 26% (13/50) samples were nPCR, PCR and RT-PCR positive 
      for TTVs PCV2 and HEV respectively. TTVs were detected in 84% (16/19) of the samples 
      which were determined to be of mild severity while present in almost all (90% or 
      9/10) samples identified as having moderate hepatitis lesions. Additionally, the 
      livers of 12 out of 21 (57%) pigs without the hepatitis lesions were positive for 
      TTVs. These results demonstrate an association between TTVs and infectious hepatitis 
      of pigs in concomitant infections with PCV2 and/or HEV and indicated that TTVs may 
      play a role as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of disease.

TI  - Clinical significance of TT virus in chronic hepatitis C.
PG  - 202-8
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Much is still unknown about the clinical significance of TT 
      virus (TTV), which has been reported as a candidate for non A-G hepatitis virus. The 
      aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of TTV in patients 
      coinfected with TTV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: The 95 subjects studied 
      had chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and underwent interferon (IFN) therapy. TT Virus DNA 
      was detected by using polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequences were 
      determined by using a dideoxy chain termination method. A phylogenetic tree was 
      drawn up by using the neighbor-joining method. RESULTS: TT Virus DNA was detected in 
      37.9% of patients with the use of an open reading frame 1 (ORF1) primer, and in 
      88.4% of patients by using a 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) primer. Using both sets 
      of primers, no differences were found between TTV-DNA-positive and -negative 
      subjects with CHC in the clinical findings. Serum TTV DNA was eradicated in 30.6% of 
      patients with the ORF1 primer, and in 19.1% of patients with the 5' UTR primer at 6 
      months after the cessation of IFN therapy. The levels of TTV DNA before IFN therapy 
      were significantly lower in the viral eradication group than in non-eradication 
      group. The changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations were 
      significantly correlated with changes in HCV-RNA in CHC patients with TTV. Moreover, 
      there was no correlation between the changes in TTV DNA and the course of ALT. 
      CONCLUSION: Hepatocellular injury in patients with chronic hepatitis who are 
      coinfected with HCV and TTV appears to primarily be caused by HCV and is less 
      attributable to TTV.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus DNA in serum, tear and aqueous humour of patients 
      undergoing cataract operation.
PG  - 759-62
AB  - PURPOSE: Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a novel non-enveloped, 
      single-stranded DNA virus with unclear pathogenesis throughout the world. Many 
      studies were conducted to determine this virus in various body fluids and different 
      primer sets have been tested for accurate diagnosis. This study aimed to collect 
      data on the prevalence of TTV in serum, tear and aqueous humour of patients 
      undergoing planned cataract surgery and to determine efficacy of three different 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. METHODS: A total of 72 specimens (24 
      each of serum, tear and aqueous humour specimens) were collected from 24 patients 
      (11 male and 13 female) having age-related cataract. The patients did not have any 
      other ocular pathology. TTV DNA was investigated by three different PCR methods: a 
      seminested PCR performed with Okamato's primers, a one-step PCR performed with 
      degenerative Takashi's primers and a commercial real-time PCR system. RESULTS: TTV 
      DNA was detected in 20 (83.3%) of the 24 serum specimens by the one-step PCR and 
      real-time PCR system. However, seminested PCR yielded a positivity rate of 25%. TTV 
      DNA positivities of the one-step PCR and the real-time PCR system were 33.3% and 
      66.6% of the 24 tear specimens, respectively. Seminested PCR did not yield positive 
      result in these specimens. From aqueous humour specimens, TTV DNA was detected in 3 
      (12.5%) of the 24 specimens only by the real-time PCR. TTV DNA positivity of 
      seminested PCR was significantly low in all specimens. CONCLUSIONS: TTV DNA was 
      detected in serum, tear and aqueous humour of patients undergoing cataract surgery, 
      supporting the idea that this virus can be detected almost all of the body fluids 
      but at different rates under various PCR conditions and primer sets. Using 
      commercial real-time PCR significantly increased the TTV DNA positivity.

LID - e17501
AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), a member of the family Anelloviridae, is a 
      single-stranded, circular DNA virus, widely distributed in swine populations. 
      Presently, two TTSuV genogroups are recognized: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 
      Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuV genomes have been found in commercial 
      vaccines for swine, enzyme preparations and other drugs containing components of 
      porcine origin. However, no studies have been made looking for TTSuV in cell 
      cultures. In the present study, a search for TTSuV genomes was carried out in cell 
      culture lineages, in sera used as supplement for cell culture media as well as in 
      trypsin used for cell disaggregation. DNA obtained from twenty-five cell lineages 
      (ten from cultures in routine multiplication and fifteen from frozen ampoules), nine 
      samples of sera used in cell culture media and five batches of trypsin were examined 
      for the presence of TTSuV DNA. Fifteen cell lineages, originated from thirteen 
      different species contained amplifiable TTSuV genomes, including an ampoule with a 
      cell lineage frozen in 1985. Three cell lineages of swine origin were co-infected 
      with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. One batch of trypsin contained two distinct TTSuV1 plus 
      one TTSuV2 genome, suggesting that this might have been the source of contamination, 
      as supported by phylogenetic analyses of sequenced amplicons. Samples of fetal 
      bovine and calf sera used in cell culture media did not contain amplifiable TTSuV 
      DNA. This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV as contaminants in cell 
      lineages. In addition, detection of the viral genome in an ampoule frozen in 1985 
      provides evidence that TTSuV contamination is not a recent event. These findings 
      highlight the risks of TTSuV contamination in cell cultures, what may be source for 
      contamination of biological products or compromise results of studies involving in 
      vitro multiplied cells.

AB  - Torque teno felis virus (FcTTV) was detected in the cat population in the Czech 
      Republic. A total of 110 serum samples were tested by a nested PCR technique using 
      specific primers, situated in the highly conserved untranslated region of the virus 
      genome. The frequency of feline TT virus in the Czech Republic was found to be 
      33.63%. Sequencing of PCR product from several virus strains showed that all of them 
      are closely related and belong to the same virus species. Whole genome sequencing of 
      three strains was performed to compare overall genetic heterogeneity of feline TT 
      viruses. One of these three strains showed more that 10% difference at the 
      nucleotide level. Furthermore we didn't find any correlation between FcTTV infection 
      and sex or health status of examined animals.

PG  - 328-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perinatal infection of transfusion transmitted virus 
      (TTV) in the mother-to-infant transmission and molecular evidence. METHODS: TTV was 
      examined in serum from 104 mothers and umbilical blood of their infants by a 
      semi-nested polymerase chain reaction technique. TTV nucleotide sequences isolated 
      from two sets of mother/infant pairs were analyzed. RESULTS: The TTV detection rate 
      was 13.46% (15/104), and it was 4.81% (5/104) in the umbilical blood of their 
      newborns. Homology analysis was done by sequencing between positions 1,915 and 2,185 
      of the published TTV genome, Analysis of TTV sequences from the 2 pairs of mother 
      and infant both infected confirmed a genetic link between the virus of the infected 
      mother and their infected infants. CONCLUSIONS: There is a possibility of vertical 
      maternal-fetal transmission of TTV.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus prevalence in subjects at high risk of sexually 
      transmitted infection in Turkey.
PG  - 363-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the possible sexual transmission of virus and to identify the 
      prevalence of TTV viremia in Turkey and its association with other hepatotropic 
      viruses. METHODS: Serum samples were collected from 81 subjects (74 prostitutes and 
      seven homosexual men) at high risk of sexually transmitted infection and from 81 
      healthy controls (74 females and seven males). Sera of patients and controls were 
      tested for TTV, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human 
      immunodeficiency virus. Also, serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were 
      measured. RESULTS: The prevalence rates of TTV viremia in the risk group and control 
      group were 86.4% and 82.7%, respectively. There was a statistical difference in mean 
      age between TTV-infected and uninfected subjects (38.6 +/- 9.9 versus 32.2 +/- 6.1 
      years, respectively, P < 0.001). Prevalence rates of TTV infection in subjects with 
      positive anti-HAV and positive anti-HBc were high when compared with subjects who 
      were negative for these. CONCLUSION: We suggest that TTV infection has a diverse 
      route of transmission, and its prevalence increases with age; also, the prevalence 
      rate of TTV is high in certain risk groups. The prevalence rates of TTV in the group 
      at risk for sexual transmission (86.4%) and in the control group (82.7%) were among 
      the highest ever reported in the world. Also, we suggest that TTV generally does not 
      cause clinical disease, in spite of this high prevalence.

TI  - Interspousal transmission of TT virus: low efficiency and lack of apparent risk 
      factors.
PG  - 1287-91
AB  - BACKGROUND: The TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified human DNA virus and little is 
      known about its non-parenteral transmission. The aim of the present study was to 
      explore the prevalence of TTV infection in spouses of index cases and the related 
      risk factors. METHODS: Serum TTV-DNA was studied in spouses of 41 subjects with TT 
      viremia. For couples in which both husband and wife had TT viremia, nucleotide 
      sequences of the open reading frame-1 region were analyzed by phylogenetic tree 
      constructions. RESULTS: Three (7%) of 41 spouses were positive for TTV-DNA. No 
      differences were noted between index patients with seropositive spouses and those 
      without seropositive spouses with regard to clinical characteristics, including 
      parenteral risk factors and exposure duration. Nucleotide sequence comparison and 
      phylogenetic tree analysis of the viral genome in three TTV-infected couples 
      revealed the isolates to be closely related in two, with a homology of 97 and 98%, 
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that interspousal transmission of 
      TTV does occur; however,the efficiency of transmission is low compared with 
      hepatitis C virus and GB virus-C. There are no apparent risk factors for 
      transmission between spouses and further studies are needed to clarify other modes 
      of non-parenteral transmission.

TI  - The role of transfusion-transmitted virus in patients undergoing hemodialysis.
PG  - 86-8
AB  - GOALS: To study transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in 75 patients on 
      hemodialysis and examine its relationship with age, sex, duration of dialysis, 
      history of transfusion, and chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
      levels. STUDY: Serum TTV was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TTV 
      genotypes by restriction fragment length polymorphism, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      RNA by PCR. RESULTS: Transfusion-transmitted virus was detected in 32 patients 
      (42.7%). Transfusion-transmitted virus genotypes were as follows: G1 in 16 patients; 
      G2, 3; G3, 1; G4, 2; G2-G5, 6; and unclassified, 4. Mean duration of dialysis was 37 
      +/- 32 months for TTV-positive patients and 43 +/- 37 months for TTV-negative 
      patients (not significant). Twenty-seven (84%) TTV-positive patients and 27 (63%) 
      TTV-negative patients had a history of transfusions ( p = 0.04). Chronic ALT 
      elevation was observed in 9 patients; 5 of them were TTV-positive (16%) and 4 were 
      TTV-negative (9%) (not significant). Four (40%) HCV RNA-positive patients and 5 (8%) 
      HCV RNA-negative patients had chronic ALT elevation ( p = 0.003). Three TTV-positive 
      patients with chronic ALT elevation were also infected with HCV. The two patients 
      with isolated TTV infection did not have another clinical feature to explain their 
      ALT elevation. CONCLUSIONS: Transfusion-transmitted virus had a high prevalence in 
      the patients on hemodialysis; genotype G1 accounts for half of the cases. 
      Transfusion-transmitted virus infection depends on the transfusional antecedent but 
      not on the duration of dialysis. Chronic ALT elevation is significantly associated 
      with HCV infection but not TTV infection. However, TTV could be a causative agent of 
      chronic ALT elevation in some patients.

TI  - Different behavior of erythrovirus B19 and torquetenovirus in response to a single 
      step of albumin purification.
PG  - 1162-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The safety of human serum albumin (HSA) is of special interest with 
      respect to virus transmission because of the wide use of this blood product as a 
      therapeutic agent and also, added to other products, as an excipient or a 
      stabilizer. Conflicting data are reported concerning HSA contamination by small, 
      naked viruses such as the erythrovirus B19 (B19V) and the anellovirus 
      torquetenovirus (TTV). This study has been performed to assess the effect of the HSA 
      purification procedures on the viral contamination. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Known 
      concentrations of B19V and TTV virus were spiked in raw Fraction V, the starting 
      material from fractionated human plasma for HSA purification, which was subsequently 
      submitted to the depth filtration procedure. After spiking, B19V and TTV genome 
      copies were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays in 
      the mixture at the end of Fraction V dissolution, to determine the virus 
      concentration achieved, in the HSA solution after the filtration step, in the 
      filtered postwashing fluid, and in the supernatant of resuspended Celite. RESULTS: 
      B19V was completely adsorbed by the Celite used as a filter aid in the depth 
      filtration process and was thus undetectable in the resulting HSA-containing 
      fraction. In contrast, in 2 out of 3 experiments, TTV was detected in all samples. 
      CONCLUSION: The different behavior of the two viruses might be a reflection of their 
      different surface charge.

TI  - Prevalence and genotypic variability of TTV in HIV-infected patients.
PG  - 2401-7
AB  - TT virus is a small, circular DNA virus, that has been associated with transfusion 
      hepatitis. We sought to determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) in patients with 
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to characterize the virus in terms 
      of genotypic variability and in the relationship to CD4+, HIV viral loads, HCV/HIV 
      coinfection, and ALT abnormalities. A cross-sectional analysis of HIV-infected 
      patients in the United States, including 86 HIV-positive subjects and 118 
      HIV-negative controls was performed. TTV was detected using a seminested PCR 
      technique. Samples underwent cloning and sequence analysis and/or RFLP to determine 
      genotype. Thirty-eight percent of HIV-positive patients had TTV infection versus 
      14.4% of patients within the matching cohort (P = 0.0009). The highest rate of TTV 
      infection was in patients with concurrent HCV/HIV infection (54% vs 30%, P = 0.038). 
      HIV-infected subjects with TTV had lower ALT levels than those without TTV (P = 
      0.036). Intravenous drug use was the leading factor associated with TTV positivity 
      among HIV-positive subjects. Mixed genotypes were more common in those with HIV. 
      Therefore, TTV prevalence, ALT levels, and genomic heterogeneity of TTV all seem to 
      be altered in patients with HIV.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus infection in HIV-1-seropositive patients.
PG  - 246-50
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence, persistence and genome heterogeneity of 
      transfusion-transmitted (TTV) in HIV-1-infected patients, a group at high risk both 
      of contracting blood-borne viruses and having viral persistence relating to 
      immunodepression. METHODS: Plasma samples from 238 HIV-1 seropositive subjects and 
      226 healthy blood donors were examined for TTV-DNA both by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) using primers from the conserved regions in the N22 clone and PCR using 
      primers deduced from the untranslated region (UTR). Direct DNA sequencing and 
      phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize 27 TTV isolates from HIV-1 patients 
      or healthy controls. RESULTS: Using PCR with the UTR primers, TTV DNA was detected 
      in a very high percentage (> 80%) of samples both from HIV-1 seropositive subjects 
      and from blood donors. Using PCR with N22 primers, shown to detect viral strains 
      associated with hepatitis of unknown etiology, TTV DNA was found in 103 of 238 
      (43.3%) HIV-1-infected patients and in 22 of 226 (9.7%) blood donors. There was no 
      difference in the prevalence of the TTV DNA in HIV seropositive subjects with regard 
      to clinical features related to immunosuppression, markers of HCV infection or 
      intravenous drug use; presence of TTV DNA was associated significantly only with 
      male gender (P = 0.003). Persistent or intermittent viremia was detected in plasma 
      samples taken up over a period of 19 months in all (15 of 15) HIV-infected patients 
      tested. CONCLUSIONS: The persistence and high frequency of infection detected by PCR 
      with N22 primers in HIV-1 seropositive patients suggest that further clinical 
      investigation of immunocompromised hosts will provide information to clarify the 
      pathogenic role of TTV.

AB  - We describe a novel species of torque teno mini virus called TTMV-204, which was 
      isolated from the gingival epithelium of patients with periodontitis and 
      characterized using viral metagenomics. The sequence of the full genome is 2824 nt 
      in length. Phylogenetic analysis and genetic analyses show classic Betatorquevirus 
      species organization with less than 40% amino acid similarity in ORF1. The 
      prevalence of TTMV-204 in the periodontitis patient population was 18.75% (15/80), 
      which was higher than in periodontally healthy individuals (10.00%, 10/80). However, 
      the difference of the TTMV-204 prevalence between two groups was not statistically 
      significant (p = 0.115). Further investigation is required to determine whether this 
      new virus is associated with inflammation.

AB  - We detected Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) in tissue samples from 
      18 stillborn piglets using nested polymerase chain reaction. The detection rates of 
      TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were 78% and 50%, respectively, with 83% of the stillborn piglets 
      positive for TTSuV1 or TTSuV2. TTSuV1 was detected highest in the liver (72%) 
      followed by heart (56%), spleen (38%) and tonsils (38%) while TTSuV2 was detected 
      highest in the tonsils (38%) followed by liver (33%), spleen (25%), and heart (17%). 
      These results indicate that TTSuVs are commonly present but not equally distributed 
      among the tissues of stillborn piglets.

TI  - Transfusion transmitted virus in screened United Arab Emirates blood donors.
PG  - 58-62
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the rate of infection caused by Torque teno virus (TTV) in 
      United Arab Emirates (UAEs) healthy population as a pilot study in detecting TTV DNA 
      in 100 healthy blood donors. METHODS: We randomly choose a total of 100 healthy 
      blood donors who attended Zayed Military Hospital, Abu Dhabi, UAE from January 20 to 
      May 30, 2005. We carried out a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to 
      detect TTV DNA. RESULTS: Real-time for TTV was positive in 75 (75%) donors. Eight 
      (73%) non-UAE donors were TTV positive while 67 (75%) were UAEs. Among these donors, 
      72 (77%) were males and 3 (50%) were females. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated a 
      high prevalence of TTV in UAE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torquetenovirus (TTV) represents a commensal human virus producing 
      life-long viremia in approximately 80% of healthy individuals of all ages. A 
      potential pathogenic role for TTV has been suggested in immunocompromised patients 
      with hepatitis of unknown etiology sustained by strong proinflammatory cytokines. 
      OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the sera immunological profile 
      linked to TTV infection in bone marrow transplant (BMT) children with liver injury. 
      STUDY DESIGN: TTV infection was assessed in sera from 27 BMT patients with altered 
      hepatic parameters and histological features, by the use of quantitative real-time 
      PCR, along with TTV genogroups and coinfection with HEV. The qualitative and 
      quantitative nature of soluble inflammatory factors was evaluated studying a large 
      set of cytokines using the Bioplex platform. As controls, sera from 22 healthy 
      children negative for serological and molecular hepatitis markers including TTV and 
      HEV, and for autoimmune diseases, were selected. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: TTV was 
      detected in 81.4% of BMT patients with a viral load ranging from 10(5) to 10(9) 
      copies/mL. All samples were HEV-RNA negative. A pattern of cytokines, IFN-γ, TNF-α, 
      FGF-basic (p<0.01) and MCP-3 (p<0.001) was found significantly highly expressed in 
      TTV-positive patients compared to TTV-negative and controls. Of note, MCP-3 
      chemokine showed the highest sera concentration independently of the amount of TTV 
      load and the status of immune system deregulation (p<0.001). In this pilot study for 
      the first time, a positive association was found between TTV and increased level of 
      MCP-3 suggesting a indirect role of TTV in liver injury.

TI  - Presence of TTV DNA in serum, liver and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 
      patients with chronic hepatitis.
PG  - 440-7
AB  - The main site of TT virus (TTV) replication remains unknown. Therefore, we have 
      studied the presence and titres of TTV DNA in paired serum, liver and PBMC samples 
      from 50 patients with liver disease (32 with chronic hepatitis B or C, seven with 
      cryptogenic hepatitis and 11 with nonviral liver disease) were included. TTV DNA was 
      analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers from the open reading 
      frame 1 (ORF 1) and from the untranslated region (UTR) and titres were 
      semiquantified by PCR using an external standard. TTV DNA was detected in 26% of 
      serum, 24% of liver and 14% of PBMC samples with ORF 1 primers. When UTR primers 
      were used, 70% of serum and liver samples and 64% of PBMC were TTV DNA positive. No 
      differences between TTV positive and negative patients were found regarding 
      epidemiological or biochemical parameters. Trypsin treatment and fluorescent in situ 
      hybridization confirm the intracellular location of TTV in PBMC. The mean of TTV DNA 
      titres was statistically higher in liver than in serum or PBMC. TTV titres in serum 
      correlated with those in PBMC but not with those in liver. In conclusion, although 
      the liver seems to be the main site for TTV replication, this virus is also able to 
      infect PBMC.

TI  - Transcriptional regulation of TT virus: promoter and enhancer regions in the 1.2-kb 
      noncoding region.
PG  - 341-8
AB  - Since the discovery of TT virus (TTV) in 1997, its mechanism of transcriptional 
      control has remained unsolved. Molecular analysis points at the 1.2-kb noncoding 
      region (NCR) as being responsible for transcriptional control. The 5' terminus of 
      TTV mRNA was located at nt 114 using the primer extension method (nt 114 will be 
      referred to as position +1). This employed the PE1 primer, designed to start 
      approximately 100 nt downstream of the predicted initiation site. Overall promoter 
      and enhancer activity of the NCR was analyzed using dual luciferase assays in K562, 
      Jurkat, U937, A549, HepG2, Huh7, and HeLaS3 cells. Of those tested, K562 showed the 
      highest relative luciferase activity of 31.1, and activity in HepG2 (14.6) was 
      significantly higher than that in Huh7 (2.8). Fragments of <250 nt length, spanning 
      the NCR, were inserted into a luciferase vector possessing an SV40 promoter. 
      Fragments F5(-542/-311) and F6(-310/-197) showed promoter-enhancing activities of 
      >6.0 by insertion not only in the sense orientation, but also both in the antisense 
      orientation and downstream of the luciferase gene. The 5' deletion of NCR from -1201 
      to -370 resulted in no significant decrease in the level of luciferase activity. A 
      gradual decrease in the activity of the 5'-deletion mutants from position -370 
      through -155 was consistent with the loss of enhancer binding sites detected during 
      fragment analysis. A further deletion at position -76 completely abolished 
      luciferase expression, indicating that region -154/-76 contains the critical 
      regulatory element for functioning of the TTV promoter.

TI  - Detection of TT virus in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.
PG  - 304-13
AB  - The TT virus, a recently identified single-stranded DNA virus with unknown 
      pathogenicity, has been shown to commonly infect humans. Viruses have been 
      considered to contribute to disease pathogenesis in autoimmune disorders including 
      idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We assessed 
      the prevalence of TTV infection in IIM compared with that in patients with RA and 
      healthy blood donors. Detection of TTV was conducted by nested PCR and real-time PCR 
      in the sera of 94 patients with IIM, 95 RA patients. and 95 age- and sex-matched 
      healthy blood donors. Identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. TTV 
      DNA was detected in 61 of 94 (64.9%) patients with IIM, in 64 of 95 (67.4%) patients 
      with RA, and in 62 of 95 (65.3%; P > 0.05) healthy individuals. Age, sex, activity, 
      or duration of disease had no influence on TTV positivity in either group. However, 
      patients with severe IIM (n = 36) had a significantly higher rate of TTV infection 
      (31/36, 86.1%) than patients with mild disease (30/58, 51.7%, P < 0.05, chi(2) = 
      10.0). Disease was considered severe in IIM when immunosuppressive treatment was 
      necessary because of continuous high activity and/or serious inner-organ involvement 
      despite corticosteroid treatment. In conclusion, although we found the detection 
      rate of TTV similar in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and 
      rheumatoid arthritis and comparable to that in healthy controls, our data suggest 
      that infection with TT virus may result in a more severe disease in patients with 
      idiopathic inflammatory myopathies.

TI  - Infection with transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) in humans and other primates in 
      Venezuela.
PG  - 173-80
AB  - Tranfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), a single-stranded circular DNA virus that 
      chronically infects humans and other animals, displays a high degree of genetic 
      diversity and was originally thought to be associated with hepatitis. The 
      prevalences of TTV infection among different populations of humans and non-human 
      primates from Venezuela have now been evaluated, using serum samples and three 
      different detection tests. All three tests were PCR-based, one involving a 
      hemi-nested PCR and primers based on the N22 open-reading-frame-1 region (N22-PCR), 
      another employing 55 cycles with primers from the more conserved untranslated region 
      (UTR-PCR), and the other using a hemi-nested PCR with primers from the same region 
      (HUTR-PCR). The overall prevalences of human infection appeared much higher with the 
      HUTR-PCR (52%) than with the N22-PCR (13%) or the UTR-PCR (5%). When the products 
      amplified by N22-PCR from 28 human isolates of TTV were sequenced, only two 
      genotypes of the virus were detected. The non-human sera tested came from primates 
      kept in a zoo in north-western Venezuela. TTV DNA was detected, by HUTR-PCR, in both 
      of the chimpanzee sera tested but not in any of the sera from the 11 New-World 
      primates or the other 12 Old-World primates that were investigated. The results, 
      particularly those of the HUTR-PCR, indicate that TTV infection is common in 
      Venezuela, especially in populations, such as many Amerindian groups, who live under 
      poor sanitary conditions. Although TTV infection may be relatively rare among 
      non-human primates from the New World, this will have to be investigated further, 
      using many more samples collected throughout the Americas.

TI  - The prevalence of viral hepatitis among the Hmong people of northern Thailand.
PG  - 837-44
AB  - Sera from 269 Hmong people (102 males and 167 females, with mean age 35.4 years, 
      range 16-63 years) were examined in order to determine the seroprevalence of 
      hepatitis virus infection. The seroprevalence rates for HAV (hepatitis A virus), HBV 
      (hepatitis B virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), HDV (hepatitis D virus), HEV 
      (hepatitis E virus), HGV (hepatitis G virus) and TTV (TT virus) infection were 87.8% 
      (n=140), 76.0% (n=150), 2.0% (n=150), 0.7% (n=150), 6.5% (n=139), 5.3% (n=94) and 
      25.6% (n=121) respectively. The rate for carriers of HBV (HBsAg) was 13.8% (20.5% in 
      males and 9.6% females) with a peak prevalence in the 21-40 year age group. A high 
      rate of HAV seropositivity was found among the younger subjects. The rate of HEV 
      seroprevalence was low. The prevalence of TTV-DNA was high with no difference 
      between the sexes. HGV-RNA prevalence was low and seen primarily in males. This 
      study indicates that the Hmong people are endemically infected with HAV and HBV 
      infection and should be considered for targeted vaccination. The role of TTV and HGV 
      in producing illness and hepatic disease has yet to be determined in this 
      population.

TI  - Transfusional transmitted virus seroprevalence in asymptomatic HBsAg (+) hepatitis B 
      carriers.
PG  - 174-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the transfusional transmitted 
      virus (TTV) seroprevalence in asymptomatic HBsAg (+) patients and to assess the 
      influence of TTV on the course of these patients. METHODS: Sixty asymptomatic HBV 
      carriers were included and 31 healthy volunteers served as controls. Cases were 
      followed at 6-month intervals for a total duration of 4 years. RESULTS: In the 
      asymptomatic carrier group, 31 patients (51.7%) had a history of surgery and 10 
      (16.7%) had a history of blood transfusions. TTV-DNA was detected in 45 of these 
      patients (75%). In the control group, 12 patients (38.7%) had a history of surgery 
      and 2 had (6.5%) a history of blood transfusions. TTV-DNA was found in 20 (64.5%) of 
      these subjects. The incidence of TTV-DNA positivity was not significantly different 
      between the two groups (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: In spite of the common occurrence of 
      HBV and TTV, TTV-DNA was also detected in 64.5% of healthy controls. Furthermore, 
      during 4 years of follow up, TTV had no detrimental effects on the course of 
      asymptomatic HBV carriers. These results suggest that the hepatic injury due to TTV 
      is insignificant in this group of patients.

TI  - High torquetenovirus loads are correlated with bronchiectasis and peripheral airflow 
      limitation in children.
PG  - 804-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of torquetenovirus 
      (TTV) infection in a group of children with recurrent lower respiratory tract 
      infections and radiologic evidence of bronchiectasis. Correlations between TTV loads 
      and severity of bronchiectasis and between TTV loads and lung function were 
      evaluated. METHODS: In 38 subjects, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and 
      plasma tests for TTV detection and quantification were done. In 21/38 subjects, 
      spirometry was also performed. RESULTS: TTV was found in 31/38 (81.6%) patients. The 
      correlation between TTV loads and severity of bronchiectasis was statistically 
      significant (r = 0.548; P = 0.01). TTV loads showed inverse correlation with 
      FEF25-75% (r = -0.541; P = 0.011), and FEF25-75%/FVC (r = -0.512; P = 0.018). 
      Inverse correlation was found also between severity of bronchiectasis and functional 
      lung parameters: FEF25-75% (r = -0.635; P = 0.002), FEV1/FVC (r = -0.541; P = 
      0.011), and FEF25-75%/FVC (r = -0.645; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      demonstrated the high prevalence of TTV infection in children with bronchiectasis. 
      Moreover, we have shown a significant correlation between TTV loads and airflow 
      limitation within the peripheral airways, as well as between severity of 
      bronchiectasis and decrease of lung function.

TI  - The prevalence of TT virus in cancer patients.
PG  - 463-8
AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a recently discovered 
      transfusion-transmissible DNA virus. Its frequency and clinical impact has not been 
      established in cancer patients in Turkey. In this study, we determined the 
      prevalence of TTV DNA positivity, and its relationship with history of transfusion, 
      amount of transfusion, age and sex in patients with hematological and solid 
      malignancies. Sixty-one patients (35 male and 26 female) followed up for various 
      malignancies and 45 healthy subjects were included in the study. ITV DNA was assayed 
      by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV DNA was detected in 18 of 61 patients 
      (29.5%) and in 5 of 45 control subjects (11.1%). In cancer patients, the prevalence 
      of TTV DNA positivity was higher to comparison with control group. In addition, the 
      prevalence of TTV DNA positivity was significantly higher in 22 patients who had a 
      history of blood transfusion in the last 6 months than 39 patients who had no 
      current or past history of transfusion (40.9% vs 23.0% respectively). These results 
      suggest that the prevalence of TTV DNA is high and the parenteral route is an 
      important mode of transmission for TTV in cancer patients. In addition, the high 
      prevalence and persistence of TTV in cancer patients with parenteral risk exposure 
      could be related to the immunodeficiency due to cancer and high viral loads by 
      parenteral route.

TI  - Clinical significance of TT virus infection in children with chronic hepatitis B.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenic role of TT virus (TTV) is not clear in patients with 
      chronic hepatitis B. The aims of the present study were to determine the frequency 
      of TTV positivity in serum and saliva samples and the possible role of TTV in 
      children with chronic hepatitis B. METHODS: Sera and saliva from 29 healthy children 
      and 25 children with chronic hepatitis B were tested for TTV-DNA by means of 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Fifty-two percent (13/25) of the 
      serum samples and 32% (8/25) of the saliva samples were positive for TTV-DNA in 
      children with chronic hepatitis B. In healthy non-transfused children, TTV-DNA was 
      detected in 58% (17/29) of the serum samples and 41% (12/29) of the saliva samples. 
      Six (46%) of 13 children with chronic hepatitis and 10 (59%) of 17 healthy children 
      had TTV-DNA positivity both in serum and saliva samples. Two serum samples were 
      negative for TTV-DNA while the saliva samples were positive for TTV-DNA in chronic 
      hepatitis B and control groups. Mean age, sex, serum alanine aminotransferase 
      levels, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA values were similar in TTV-positive and 
      -negative children with chronic hepatitis B. However, total histologic activity 
      index (HAI), periportal necrosis and portal inflammation scores were significantly 
      higher in children with HBV-DNA and TTV-DNA viremia (P = 0.013, P = 0.008, P = 
      0.015, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Because total HAI, periportal necrosis and portal 
      inflammation scores were higher in children with TTV coinfection, TTV infection may 
      contribute to the progression of liver damage in children with chronic hepatitis B.

TI  - Torquetenovirus viremia kinetics after autologous stem cell transplantation are 
      predictable and may serve as a surrogate marker of functional immune reconstitution.
PG  - 189-92
LID - 10.1016/j.jcv.2009.11.027 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: It is common experience that retreating patients too early after a 
      course of intensive chemotherapy predisposes to opportunistic infections despite 
      apparently normal lymphocyte levels. OBJECTIVES: The extent of replication of 
      persistent viruses that cause no obvious disease (and hence need no treatment) might 
      better define when a patient has recovered from functional immune deficiency. STUDY 
      DESIGN: We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to monitor the kinetics of 
      plasma torquetenovirus (TTV) viremia in hematological patients undergoing autologous 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as support to high-dose chemotherapy (HSCT). 
      RESULTS: Independently from underlying hematological disease and therapeutic 
      regimen, TTV viremia increased post-HSCT, and this increase paralleled the increase 
      of circulating CD8(+)CD57(+) T lymphocytes, known to represent an indirect marker of 
      functional immune deficiency. Subsequently, within a matter of months, TTV levels 
      returned to baseline values, at a pace that appeared to be constant over time. 
      CONCLUSION: Monitoring of TTV viremia represents a unique opportunity to follow 
      functional immune reconstitution in immunosuppressed patients. Also, the size of the 
      TTV viremia increases resulting from immunosuppressive treatments might be of 
      guidance in determining the appropriate time interval before delivery of a next 
      course of therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The first era in the discoveries of respiratory viruses occured 
      between 1933 and 1965 when influenza virus, enteroviruses, adenovirus, respiratory 
      syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus (CoV) were found by 
      virus culture. In the 1990s, the development of high throughput viral detection and 
      diagnostics instruments increased diagnostic sensitivity and enabled the search for 
      new viruses. This article briefly reviews the clinical significance of newly 
      discovered respiratory viruses. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2001, the second era in the 
      discoveries of respiratory viruses began, and several new respiratory viruses and 
      their subgroups have been found: human metapneumovirus, CoVs NL63 and HKU1, human 
      bocavirus and human rhinovirus C and D groups. SUMMARY: Currently, a viral cause of 
      pediatric respiratory illness is identifiable in up to 95% of cases, but the 
      detection rates decrease steadily by age, to 30-40% in the elderly. The new viruses 
      cause respiratory illnesses such as common cold, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, 
      exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. 
      Rarely, acute respiratory failure may occur. The clinical role of other new viruses, 
      KI and WU polyomaviruses and the torque teno virus, as respiratory pathogens is not 
      clear.

TI  - [GBV-C/HGV and TTV infection markers in Polish blood donors and haemophilia 
      patients].
PG  - 581-8
AB  - Viruses GBV-C/HGV and TTV were identified in patients with hepatitis of unknown 
      etiology. Aim of our study was to assess the frequency of infection markers of these 
      viruses in blood donors and haemophilia patients treated with virucidaly activated 
      and non inactivated blood products. Material and methods. TTV DNA (by PCR using 
      primers to coding ORFI and non-coding region NC) and GBV-C/HGV (RNA by RT-PCR and 
      anti-E2 by EIA) were tested in blood donors (200 for TTV and 219 for GBV-C/HGV), 122 
      haemophilia patients treated in the past with non inactivated blood products and in 
      20 haemophilia children treated exclusively with inactivated clotting preparations. 
      Results RNA GBV-C/HGV were identified in 3,2%; 23,7% and in 0%, respectively blood 
      donors, adult and children haemophilia patients. Antibody anti-E2 were found in 
      23,6%; 37% i 25% of studied groups respectively. DNA TTV was detected most 
      frequently by NC than ORF1 primers: in 78% vs.10% of blood donors, 100% vs 43,5% of 
      adult haemophilia patients and in 95% vs. 15% young haemophiliacs. Conclusions 
      Haemophilia patients were at risk of GBV-C/HGV and TTV infection. Following 
      implementation of viral inactivation methods in the process of clotting factor 
      concentrates production, the risk for GBV-C/HGV transmission was significantly 
      reduced and in less extant for TTV.

TI  - Virome definition in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with neurological complications 
      after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neurological complications (NC) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplant (HSCT) recipients lead to long-term sequelae and result in significant 
      morbidity and mortality. Since risk factors for NC include viral infection or 
      reactivation, virome inspection after HSCT might be helpful to the clinical 
      management of patients after HSCT. OBJECTIVES AND STUDY DESIGN: In this study we 
      investigated whether any viruses are found in association with NC after HSCT. For 
      this purpose, unbiased next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to characterize 
      nucleic acid (NA) content in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken at time of NC in 35 
      HSCT patients. Virome definition in CSF from non-transplanted subjects (controls) 
      was also tested to define the commensal flora. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: A higher 
      number of reads/contigs mapped to viruses in patients compared to the controls 
      (7,626 vs 235). Besides bacteriophages, Torque teno virus (TTV) was also identified 
      in both controls and patients. Interestingly, a significantly higher number of 
      TTV-like sequences was detected in the patient samples (7,236 vs 9), showing 
      similarities to distinct genotypes; 3/2,575, 2/1,692 and 2/2,969 contigs/reads 
      mapped to TTV11, TTV13 and Torque teno midi virus, respectively. In conclusion, 
      unbiased NGS demonstrated to be a suitable approach to characterize the virome in 
      samples containing limiting amounts of NA. The higher TTV levels and genetic 
      diversity found in CSF of subjects with NC after HSCT might suggest a possible 
      association between TTV reactivation and the disorder. However, further studies are 
      needed to evaluate the possible role of TTV on NC in HSCT patients.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus in association with hepatitis A-E viral infections in 
      various forms of liver diseases in India.
PG  - 2432-6
AB  - AIM: To describe the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in 
      association with hepatitis A-E viral infections in different forms of liver diseases 
      in North India. METHODS: Sera from a total number of 137 patients, including 37 
      patients with acute viral hepatitis (AVH), 37 patients with chronic viral hepatitis 
      (CVH), 31 patients with cirrhosis of liver and 32 patients with fulminant hepatic 
      failure (FHF), were analyzed both for TTV-DNA and hepatitis A-E viral markers. 
      Presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis E virus 
      (HEV) infections was detected in different proportions in different groups. 
      Moreover, TTV-DNA was simultaneously tested in 100 healthy blood donors also. 
      RESULTS: None of the patients had hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis D virus 
      (HDV) infections. Overall prevalence of TTV-DNA was detected in 27.1% cases with 
      AVH, 18.9% cases with CVH, 48.4% cases with cirrhosis and 9.4% cases with FHF. 
      TTV-DNA simultaneously tested in 100 healthy blood donors showed 27% positivity. On 
      establishing a relation between TTV infection with other hepatitis viral infections, 
      TTV demonstrated co-infection with HBV, HCV and HEV in these disease groups. 
      Correlation of TTV with ALT level in sera did not demonstrate high ALT level in 
      TTV-infected patients, suggesting that TTV does not cause severe liver damage. 
      CONCLUSION: TTV infection is prevalent both in patients and healthy individuals in 
      India. However, it does not have any significant correlation with other hepatitis 
      viral infections, nor does it produce an evidence of severe liver damage in patients 
      with liver diseases.

TI  - TT-virus infection in Japanese general population and in hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 1915-20
AB  - To determine TT virus (TTV) prevalence and the persistence of viremia, we 
      prospectively did cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using by the polymerase 
      chain reaction to test the successive sera of 150 Japanese hemodialysis patients and 
      compared these with those of 166 residents of a rural Japanese area endemic for 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). TTV DNA positivity was significantly higher in 50 (30.1%) 
      of the residents than in 25 (16.7%) of the patients in 1997 (P < 0.05). TTV DNA 
      positively in the patients was not associated with HCV RNA positivity and also 
      increased with the number of blood transfusions and decreased with the duration of 
      hemodialysis, but not significantly. Longitudinal study from 1997 to 1999 showed 
      that persistent TTV DNA positivity was found significantly more often in 35 (21.1%) 
      of the residents than in 13 (8.6%) of the patients (P < 0.05), and that persistent 
      TTV DNA negativity was found significantly more often in 103 (68.7%) of the patients 
      than in 91 (54.8%) of the residents (P < 0.05). Of the 25 patients and 50 residents 
      TTV DNA positive in 1997, TTV DNA was eliminated more often in 12 (48.0%) patients 
      than in 15 (30.0%) residents over the three years, but the difference was not 
      significant. The route of TTV transmission might differ from HCV in that it could be 
      nonparenteral. TTV was less prevalent in hemodialysis patients than residents, and 
      the virus was more often eliminated by hemodialysis patients than by residents 
      during the three-year observation period, possibly because of the effect of the 
      hemodialysis procedure.

TI  - Detection of TTV in peripheral blood cells from patients with altered ALT and AST 
      levels.
PG  - 195-201
AB  - This work analyzes the prevalence of TTV DNA in peripheral blood cells from patients 
      with hepatic alterations and healthy blood donors and measures levels of sodium, 
      potassium, urea, creatinine, phosphatase alkaline, total and direct bilirubin, gamma 
      glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) in certain randomly selected patients. DNA samples from 111 
      individuals were evaluated. They were divided into two groups, "A" (study) and "B" 
      (control), including 54 patients with liver enzyme alterations (ALT/AST) presenting 
      non-B-non-C hepatitis and 57 blood donors, respectively. TTV DNA was determined by 
      nested PCR. Certain products of the second-round PCR were sequenced. Serum 
      biochemical assay was performed and disclosed TTV in 31.48% (17/54) of patients in 
      group A and 5.26% (3/57) in the control group B. TTV prevalence was significantly 
      higher in patients with liver disease than in healthy donors. In group A, sodium, 
      potassium, urea, creatinine, phosphatase alkaline, total and direct bilirubin, gamma 
      glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
      aminotransferase (AST) levels were analyzed in certain randomly selected patients 
      and no significant difference in biochemical levels (p>0.05) was found when TTV 
      infected and noninfected individuals were compared. Knowledge related to TTV has 
      rapidly increased, but many fundamental aspects remain unclear. This led us to 
      question the role of TTV and doubt remains as to whether or not it is just a 
      commensal virus. Further studies are necessary to confirm and extend these findings.

TI  - SEN virus: epidemiology and characteristics of a transfusion-transmitted virus.
PG  - 1084-8
AB  - SEN virus (SEN-V) is a blood-borne, single-stranded, nonenveloped DNA virus. 
      Although its prevalence varies by geographic region, it has been detected in as many 
      as 30 percent of postoperative transfusion recipients, compared to 3 percent of 
      postoperative patients who did not receive transfusions. A significant association 
      has been observed between transfusion volume and the occurrence of SEN-V infection. 
      Transmission by transfusion also has been confirmed by the detection of greater than 
      99 percent homology between SEN-V in donor and recipient sera. Concurrent infections 
      with SEN-V and hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus 
      type 1 have been documented, and these observations probably reflect the blood-borne 
      transmission of these viruses as well as SEN-V. Although SEN-V was discovered as 
      part of a search for causes of posttransfusion hepatitis, there is no firm evidence 
      so far that SEN-V infection either causes hepatitis or worsens the course of 
      coexistent liver disease. Nevertheless, SEN-V appears to be transmitted by 
      transfusion, and further studies may reveal more about its role in the future.

TI  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) viral loads in serum of postweaning 
      multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-affected and healthy pigs in Brazil.

AB  - Associations between Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) and the occurrence of 
      postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) have been reported with 
      controversial results. Currently, no studies have been performed comparing 
      simultaneously viral loads of TTSuVs and PCV2. To examine the role for TTSuVs in 
      PMWS-affected animals, a SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) was designed to 
      detect and quantify TTSuV1, TTSuV2 and PCV2 genomes in swine sera. TTSuV1 genome 
      loads were significantly higher in healthy adults than in young and SPF animals 
      (p<0.05) suggesting that the prevalence of TTSuV1 infection increases with age and 
      bears no association with PMWS. Regarding TTSuV2, no significant variation was 
      detected in viral loads within any of the groups. As expected, PCV2 genome loads 
      were higher in PMWS-affected swine than in healthy or SPF animals (p<0.001). These 
      findings provide clear evidence to indicate that neither TTSuV1 nor TTSuV2 viral 
      loads have any correlation with the occurrence of PMWS.

TI  - Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia: a review.
PG  - 87
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-8-87 [doi]
AB  - Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is an uncommon but distinct variant of 
      aplastic anemia in which pancytopenia appears two to three months after an acute 
      attack of hepatitis. HAAA occurs most frequently in young male children and is 
      lethal if leave untreated. The etiology of this syndrome is proposed to be 
      attributed to various hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses. Several hepatitis viruses 
      such as HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV have been associated with this set of 
      symptoms. Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses such as parvovirus B19, 
      Cytomegalovirus, Epstein bar virus, Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) and non-A-E 
      hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) has also been documented to develop the syndrome. 
      Considerable evidences including the clinical features, severe imbalance of the T 
      cell immune system and effective response to immunosuppressive therapy strongly 
      present HAAA as an immune mediated mechanism. However, no association of HAAA has 
      been found with blood transfusions, drugs and toxins. Besides hepatitis and non 
      hepatitis viruses and immunopathogenesis phenomenon as causative agents of the 
      disorder, telomerase mutation, a genetic factor has also been predisposed for the 
      development of aplastic anemia. Diagnosis includes clinical manifestations, blood 
      profiling, viral serological markers testing, immune functioning and bone marrow 
      hypocellularity examination. Patients presenting the features of HAAA have been 
      mostly treated with bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA 
      matched donor, and if not available then by immunosuppressive therapy. New 
      therapeutic approaches involve the administration of steroids especially the 
      glucocorticoids to augment the immunosuppressive therapy response. Pancytopenia 
      following an episode of acute hepatitis response better to hematopoietic cell 
      transplantation than immunosuppressive therapy.

TI  - Increased prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus and cross-reactivity with 
      immunodominant epitopes of the HRES-1/p28 endogenous retroviral autoantigen in 
      patients with systemic lupus erythematosus.
PG  - 124-34
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients produce autoantibodies to 
      HRES-1/p28, a human endogenous retrovirus-encoded nuclear protein. To identify 
      cross-reactive viral antigens capable of triggering autoreactivity, HRES-1/p28 
      epitopes were mapped by SLE antibodies. METHODS: Forty-four peptides overlapping 
      HRES-1/p28 and 13 viral peptides were synthesized on cellulose membrane and tested 
      for recognition by antibodies from 16 HRES-1 Western blot seropositive SLE patients. 
      Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) was detected by gene amplification in sera of 
      211 SLE patients, 78 healthy SLE family members, 199 unrelated healthy donors, and 
      91 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. RESULTS: HRES-1/p28 residues 41-55, 121-135, 
      and 156-170 were recognized by 12/16 (75.0%), 11/16 (68.8%), and 9/16 lupus sera 
      (56.25%) and considered immunodominant. HRES-1/p28 residues 121-135 harbor 
      cross-reactive epitope with retroviral peptides and the 70 K U1snRNP lupus 
      autoantigen. HRES-1/p28 residues 41-55 and 156-170 exhibited the highest prevalence 
      of cross-reactivity with TTV peptide ORF2a (14/16, 87%). Prevalence of TTV DNA was 
      increased in lupus patients (120/211) with respect to healthy (66/199; P < 0.0001) 
      or RA controls (23/91; P < 0.0001). TTV prevalence in healthy lupus relatives 
      (40/78) was decreased with respect to lupus patients (80/121; P = 0.0184) and 
      increased with respect to unrelated healthy donors (66/199; P = 0.0026). HRES-1/p28 
      Western blot reactivity was observed in 12/23 TTV PCR-negative donors and 43/58 TTV 
      PCR-positive donors (P < 0.0281). CONCLUSIONS: Increased prevalence of TTV and 
      molecular mimicry with HRES-1/p28 may contribute to generation of antinuclear 
      antibodies and pathogenesis of SLE.

TI  - Detection of TT virus (TTV) in children and youth with chronic viral hepatitis B and 
      C.
PG  - CR29-33
AB  - BACKGROUND: TTV is a newly discovered virus and little is known about the frequency 
      of TTV infection in children in Poland. The aim of our study was to investigate the 
      frequency of TTV infection in children with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. 
      MATERIAL/METHODS: Two patient groups were tested: 74 patients with chronic hepatitis 
      B aged 4 to 20 years, and 13 patients with chronic hepatitis C aged 10 to 18 years. 
      Nucleic acids were extracted from serum using the spin column technique (QIAGEN(r), 
      Hilden, Germany), and TTV DNA sequences were amplified by nested PCR. RESULTS: TTV 
      DNA was found in 47.3% of patients with chronic hepatitis B and in 53.8% of patients 
      with hepatitis C. Among those patients with chronic B hepatitis there was no 
      statistical difference between the frequency of coinfection with TTV and 
      clinical-histopathological diagnosis, activity of aminotransaminases, frequency of 
      seroconversion of HBeAg to antiHBe, or interferon alpha therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In 
      Poland, TTV viremia is frequent in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. 
      TTV coinfection did not modify the course and activity of chronic hepatitis B or 
      influence the outcome of interferon therapy.

TI  - SEN virus infection in patients on peritoneal dialysis.
PG  - 74-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many reports have demonstrated SEN virus (SEN-V) infection rates in 
      hemodialysis patients, but the SEN-V infection rate in peritoneal dialysis (PD) 
      patients has never been reported. In this study, we determined the prevalence rate 
      of SEN-V viremia in a PD population. METHODS: Serum samples from 47 PD patients and 
      a control group of 43 subjects from the general population at their health 
      examination were assayed for SEN-V-D and -H viremia using polymerase chain reaction. 
      RESULTS: The proportions of female gender (p = 0.001), previous transfusion (p < 
      0.0001), and higher mean serum AST level (p = 0.012) were significantly higher in PD 
      patients. The prevalence rates of SEN-V-D and/or -H viremia were not significantly 
      different between PD patients and controls (27.7% vs 32.6%). SEN-V-D(+) patients had 
      lower mean duration of PD than SEN-V(-) patients. Mean ALT level was significantly 
      lower in SEN-V-H(+) than in SEN-V(-) patients (12.8 +/- 5.8 vs 19.6 +/- 12.1 (IU/L), 
      p = 0.025). None of the SEN-V-infected PD patients had overt clinical or biochemical 
      signs of liver disease. There were no statistically significant differences in 
      prevalence of SEN-V-D and/or -H viremia between automated PD (APD) patients and 
      continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that 
      the SEN-V infection rate is not different between healthy individuals and PD 
      patients. Infection with SEN-V is not associated with evident liver disease in PD 
      patients and SEN-V infection rate is not different between APD patients and CAPD 
      patients.

TI  - SEN virus prevalence among non-B and non-C hepatitis patients with high liver 
      function tests in the south of Turkey.
PG  - 349-52
AB  - We investigated the characteristics and detection rates of SEN virus (SENV) 
      infection among 100 Turkish patients who had with high alanine aminotransferase 
      (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase levels but were negative for HBV DNA and HCV 
      RNA and had no history of transfusion. As a control group, we also analyzed 50 
      healthy individuals who had normal ALT levels, were negative for HBV DNA and HCV 
      RNA, and had no history of transfusion. The serum samples of patient and controls 
      were analyzed by PCR to detect the presence of SENV DNA and its two genotypes 
      (SENV-H and SENV-D). We detected SENV DNA in 13 of 100 (13%) patients. Five of 13 
      (38.46%) patients were positive for SENV-D and 8 of 13 (61.53%) patients were 
      positive for SENV-H DNA. We also detected SENV DNA in 5 of 50 (10%) patients in the 
      control group. Two of 5 (40%) patients were positive for SENV-D and 3 of 5 (60%) 
      patients were positive for SENV-H DNA in the control group. SENV was detected at 
      almost the same frequency in the patient and control group. SENV did not seem to 
      contribute to the pathogenesis of liver disease (P > 0.05) in this cohort. Our 
      results also showed that SENV transmission was not only associated with blood 
      transfusion but also with some other possible routes.

TI  - Early Post-Transplant Torquetenovirus Viremia Predicts Cytomegalovirus Reactivations 
      In Solid Organ Transplant Recipients.
PG  - 15490
LID - 10.1038/s41598-018-33909-7 [doi]
LID - 15490
AB  - Monitoring the human virome has been recently suggested as a promising and novel 
      area of research for identifying new biomarkers which would help physicians in the 
      management of transplant patients. Imbalance of the immune system in transplant 
      recipients has a significant impact on replication of Torquetenovirus (TTV), the 
      most representative and abundant virus of human virome. TTV kinetic was studied by 
      real-time PCR in 280 liver or kidney transplant recipients who underwent different 
      drug regimens to maintain immunosuppression. During one-year post-transplant 
      follow-up, TTV viremia fluctuated irrespective of transplanted organ type but 
      consistent with the immunosuppression regimen. TTV kinetic in patients who 
      manifested cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation within the first four months 
      post-transplant differed from that observed in patients who did not experience CMV 
      complications. Importantly, plasma TTV load measured between day 0 and 10 
      post-transplant was significantly higher in CMV DNA positive than in CMV DNA 
      negative patients. TTV viremia above 3.45 log DNA copies/ml within the first 10 days 
      post-transplant correlates with higher propensity to CMV reactivation following 
      transplantation. This study provides further evidence for using early 
      post-transplant TTV viremia to predict CMV reactivation in liver or kidney 
      transplant recipients.

TI  - Identification of basal promoter and enhancer elements in an untranslated region of 
      the TT virus genome.
PG  - 10820-4
AB  - The regulation of TT virus (TTV) gene expression was characterized. 
      Transient-transfection assays using reporter constructs revealed that a 
      113-nucleotide (nt) sequence within the untranslated region, proximal to the 
      transcription initiation site and containing a TATA box motif, has a basal promoter 
      activity. This sequence is well conserved among different TTV genotypes. Upstream 
      stimulating factor bound to a consensus binding motif within this region and 
      positively regulates TTV transcription. Furthermore, a 488-nt region upstream of the 
      basal promoter exhibited enhancer activity, presumably in a cell type-specific 
      manner. This study illustrates some of the mechanisms involved in the 
      transcriptional regulation of TTV.

TI  - Torque teno virus (SANBAN isolate) ORF2 protein suppresses NF-kappaB pathways via 
      interaction with IkappaB kinases.
PG  - 11917-24
AB  - Since the first discovery of Torque teno virus (TTV) in 1997, many researchers 
      focused on its epidemiology and transcriptional regulation, but the function of 
      TTV-encoded proteins remained unknown. The function of the TTV open reading frame 
      (ORF) in the nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) pathway has not yet been established. 
      In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress 
      NF-kappaB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappaB pathway. By 
      Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level 
      of NF-kappaB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the 
      nucleus due to the inhibition of IkappaBalpha protein degradation. Further 
      immunoprecipitation assays showed that the TTV ORF2 protein could physically 
      interact with IKKbeta as well as IKKalpha, but not IKKgamma. Luciferase assays and 
      Western blot experiments showed that the TTV ORF2 protein could also suppress 
      NF-kappaB activity in the noncanonical NF-kappaB pathway and block the activation 
      and translocation of p52. Finally, we found that the TTV ORF2 protein inhibited the 
      transcription of NF-kappaB-mediated downstream genes (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, 
      and COX-2) through down-regulation of NF-kappaB. Together, these data indicate that 
      the TTV ORF2 protein suppresses the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappaB pathways, 
      suggesting that the TTV ORF2 protein may be involved in regulating the innate and 
      adaptive immunity of organisms, contributing to TTV pathogenesis, and even be 
      related to some diseases.

TI  - Infection of TT virus in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 935-42
AB  - The precipitating factors of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have not been 
      elucidated. Recently, a novel DNA virus named TTvirus (TTV) was discovered in a 
      patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology TTV is a circular, 
      single-stranded DNA virus of 3.8 kB. To evaluate the relationship between TTV and 
      IPF, the sera of 33 patients with IPF were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by 
      semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in 12 (36.4%) IPF 
      patients. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was significantly higher in 
      the IPF patients withTTV than in those without TTV (802 +/- 121 vs. 530 +/- 49 IU 
      l(-1), p < 0.05). Six (50%) of 12 patients in theTTV DNA-positive group died during 
      the observation period, while only six (28.6%) of 21 patients in theTTV DNA-negative 
      group died. The 3-year-survival rate was significantly lower in the TTV DNA-positive 
      group than in theTTV DNA-negative group (58-3% vs. 95.2%, P <0-02). Replicative 
      intermediate forms of TTV DNA were detected in the lung specimen from a TTV-infected 
      IPF patient. TTV infection influences the disease activityand prognosis of IPF in 
      some cases. Further studies are required to elucidate the clinical significance of 
      TTV in IPF.

AB  - Anelloviruses are a group of single-stranded circular DNA viruses infecting several 
      vertebrate species. Four species have been found to infect swine, namely Torque teno 
      sus virus (TTSuV) 1a and 1b (TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b; genus Iotatorquevirus), TTSuVk2a and 
      TTSuVk2b (genus Kappatorquevirus). TTSuV infection in pigs is distributed worldwide, 
      and is characterized by a persistent viremia. However, the real impact, if any, on 
      the pig health is still under debate. In the present study, the impact of pig 
      immunization on TTSuVk2a loads was evaluated. For this, three-week old conventional 
      pigs were primed with DNA vaccines encoding the ORF2 gene and the ORF1-A, ORF1-B, 
      and ORF1-C splicing variants and boosted with purified ORF1-A and ORF2 Escherichia 
      coli proteins, while another group served as unvaccinated control animals, and the 
      viral load dynamics during natural infection was observed. Immunization led to 
      delayed onset of TTSuVk2a infection and at the end of the study when the animals 
      were 15 weeks of age, a number of animals in the immunized group had cleared the 
      TTSuVk2a viremia, which was not the case in the control group. This study 
      demonstrated for the first time that TTSuV viremia can be controlled by a combined 
      DNA and protein immunization, especially apparent two weeks after the first DNA 
      immunization before seroconversion was observed. Further studies are needed to 
      understand the mechanisms behind this and its impact for pig producers.

TI  - Gross elevation of TT virus genome load in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of 
      cancer patients.
PG  - 84-92
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently described circular DNA virus of about 3.8 kb, which is 
      related to the circoviridae viruses. It is commonly detected in healthy subjects and 
      no association with any specific disease has been established. TTV was initially 
      thought to be hepatotropic, but subsequent reports have shown that it is detectable 
      in other tissues, including kidney, prostate, mammary gland, brain, bone marrow, and 
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Plasma samples from cancer patients and healthy 
      subjects were tested for the presence or absence of TTV by heminested polymerase 
      chain reaction (PCR). We also developed a quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR) 
      assay for TTV that permits accurate measurement of TTV DNA load. Using this assay, 
      the TTV genome load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy control 
      subjects (n = 50) and patients with various types of cancer (n = 148), including 
      breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, 
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and other cancers, was measured. TTV DNA was detected in 
      69 of 100 plasma samples (69%) of cancer patients tested and in 39 of 100 plasma 
      samples (39%) randomly selected from 1000 plasma samples of blood donors (p < 0.05). 
      TTV DNA was detectable in the PBMCs of 99% of the cancer patients and 86% of the 
      controls. However, the median virus load was more than 100-fold higher in the cancer 
      patients (3599 copies/100,000 cells) than among the controls (30 copies/100,000 
      cells; p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in TTV load among the 
      different cancer types. Using a cutoff value of >250 copies per 100,000 PBMCs, 93.2% 
      of cancer patients were "positive" compared to only 4% of healthy control subjects. 
      Almost all the cancer patients have TTV infection and their TTV genome load in PBMCs 
      is significantly higher than that in control subjects. It remains to be elucidated 
      whether such findings are specific to cancer patients or occur in all seriously ill 
      subjects.

TI  - Prevalence and histologic features of transfusion transmitted virus and hepatitis C 
      virus coinfection in a group of HIV patients.
PG  - 617-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: A recently identified DNA transfusion-transmitted virus has been 
      associated with post-transfusion non-A to G hepatitis. AIM: To determine the 
      prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus in patients with human immunodeficiency 
      virus infection. Its clinical role in the pathogenesis of liver disease was also 
      evaluated in patients with transfusion-transmitted-virus hepatitis C virus 
      coinfection compared with those with hepatitis C Virus infection alone. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: We evaluated 312 HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients (225 males, 87 
      females). All underwent screening for transfusion-transmitted virus DNA using a 
      nested polymerase chain reaction technique. In some transfusion transmitted 
      virus-DNA positive patients, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. In 56 patients 
      (20 transfusion-transmitted-virus-hepatitis C virus and 36 hepatitis C virus alone), 
      liver biopsy was collected. RESULTS: The prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus 
      was 113/312 (36%). The genotype distribution was similar to that reported in other 
      studies. No difference in liver histology was found between the two groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Transfusion-transmitted virus infection is common in human 
      immunodeficiency virus patients. We found no histologic differences between liver 
      biopsy specimens from patients coinfected with transfusion-transmitted virus plus 
      hepatitis C virus compared with those infected with hepatitis C virus alone. 
      Transfusion-transmitted virus is not clearly associated with a distinct liver 
      injury.

TI  - Respiratory viruses and torque teno virus in adults with acute respiratory 
      infections.
PG  - 57-68
LID - 10.1159/000369211 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To define the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in 
      adult patients. METHODS: Nasal and throat swabs were collected from all adult 
      patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), or 
      severe ARI (SARI) admitted to a tertiary hospital in Surakarta, Indonesia, between 
      March 2010 and April 2011 and analyzed for 19 respiratory viruses and for torque 
      teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV). RESULTS: Respiratory viruses were 
      detected in 61.3% of the subjects, most of whom had ARI (90.8%, OR = 11.39), were 
      hospitalized (96.9%, OR = 22.31), had asthma exacerbation (90.9%, OR = 8.67), and/or 
      had pneumonia (80%, OR = 4.0). Human rhinovirus (HRV) A43 predominated. Influenza A 
      H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) subtypes A1 and A2, the influenza B virus, human 
      adenovirus B, and human coronavirus OC43 were also detected. All respiratory viruses 
      were detected in the transition month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed 
      respiratory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza A H3N2 virus 
      with TTV, HMPV with TTV, HRV with TTV, and human parainfluenza virus-3 with TTV were 
      found in 4.7, 2.8, 19.8, and 0.9% of the samples, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This 
      study highlights the need to perform routine detection of respiratory viruses in 
      adults hospitalized with ARI, asthma exacerbation, and/or pneumonia.

TI  - Clinical characteristics and distribution of genotypes of TT virus infection in a 
      hepatitis C virus-hyperendemic township of a hepatitis B virus-endemic country 
      (Taiwan).
PG  - 1192-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) viremia, without definite clinical 
      significance, has been reported to be higher among chronic hepatitis C patients. The 
      status and clinical characteristics of TT virus (TTV) infection and distribution of 
      TTV genotypes in a hepatitis C virus (HCV) hyperendemic township (Masago community) 
      in a hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemic country (Taiwan) were investigated. METHODS: 
      Sera from 100 Masago residents were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
      markers of HBV, HCV and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) and TTV-DNA. Sera 
      of 250 blood donors as a control group were tested for TTV-DNA. Sera of Masago 
      residents and blood donors with positive TTV-DNA were directly sequenced, and 
      phylogenetic analyses were performed subsequently. RESULTS: The prevalences of TTV 
      viremia in different age groups among individuals from Masago were significantly 
      higher than that among blood donors. In regard to the subtypes of TTV, 23, seven, 
      two, eight, one, six and one isolate were related to the genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 
      3, 4 and 5, respectively, from Masago and 21, 14, one, nine and three isolates were 
      related to the genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 4, respectively, from donors. No 
      clinical or virological factor was associated with TTV viremia or TTV genotypes. 
      CONCLUSIONS: TT Virus prevalence was higher among HCV hyperendemic township 
      residents than blood donors with similar genotype distributions (genotype 1 was the 
      most prevalent) in Taiwan. Neither TTV viremia nor a particular genotype was 
      associated with HBV, HCV or GBV-C/HGV infection and abnormal ALT levels.

TI  - TT virus infection of periodontal tissues: a controlled clinical and laboratory 
      pilot study.
PG  - 1216-20
AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel single-strand, circular DNA virus has been recently isolated and 
      named TT virus (TTV). It has been demonstrated that peripheral blood cells harbor 
      TTV DNA, suggesting that the virus might replicate in lymphoid cells and contribute 
      to lymphocyte imbalances with consequent immunosuppressive effects. The purpose of 
      this study was to investigate the prevalence of TTV DNA in healthy and periodontally 
      compromised subjects, evaluating the presence of the virus in the gingiva and 
      saliva, and comparing virological results with clinical data. METHODS: Twenty-one 
      patients (seven males and 14 females, aged 25 to 76 years) were enrolled in the 
      study. Eleven subjects were diagnosed with moderate periodontitis, while 10 were 
      periodontally healthy. A sample of saliva was taken from each patient before 
      recording the periodontal data; subsequently, a gingival biopsy was performed. A 
      real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the presence of TTV DNA in 
      saliva and gingival specimens. RESULTS: A statistically significant association was 
      found between TTV in gingival tissue and the presence of periodontitis (P = 0.0351), 
      while no association was observed between TTV in saliva and the presence of 
      periodontitis (P = 0.4762). CONCLUSIONS: A new DNA virus (TTV) was first identified 
      in the gingival tissue and was found to be significantly associated with the 
      presence of periodontitis. These findings need to be investigated in further 
      studies.

TI  - Impact of TT virus infection in acute and chronic, viral- and non viral-related 
      liver diseases.
PG  - 121-7
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The prevalence and pathogenicity of TT virus, recently identified 
      in patients with non A-non G post-transfusional hepatitis, are questioned. METHODS: 
      We investigated the impact of this new viral infection in a large series of patients 
      with non A-non G, cryptogenic, non-viral and viral-related, acute and chronic liver 
      diseases (n=577) and blood donors (n=300). TTV DNA was detected in serum by 
      hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis was performed in 13 
      isolates. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 6/25 and 15/127 patients with cryptogenic 
      non A-non G acute and chronic liver disease, respectively. TTV DNA positive subjects 
      with post-transfusional acute hepatitis scored negative before transfusion. TTV 
      prevalence was increased in patients with cryptogenic non A-non G acute and chronic 
      liver disease compared to blood donors (6/300; p<0.001) and non-viral-related 
      chronic liver diseases (6/137; p<0.05). TTV/HBV coinfection was frequently 
      identified (35/147), but this was not the case for HCV-infected subjects (4/77). 
      Transaminase activity or liver histological score was not significantly increased 
      among TTV positive, HBV infected or non A-non G patients. The HBV infection and 
      Mediterranean origin were the risk factors associated with TTV infection. The 
      majority of analysed sequences clustered in genotype 1 (8=1b; 3=1a). Two isolates 
      showed homology to genotype 2. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the view that TTV 
      is a widely spread infectious agent with a weak pathogenicity. It raises the 
      possibility, however, that TTV might be implicated in a few cases of acute and 
      chronic non A-non G hepatitis. TTV-DNA-analysed sequences are related to genotypes 1 
      and 2 described in Europe.

PG  - 332-4
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the TTV infection occurs in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic hepatitis B (of medium degree) 
      and in HBsAg positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: TTV DNA in PBMCs was 
      detected by nested-polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). 
      RESULTS: 7 of 26 cases of chronic hepatitis B were positive for TTV DNA by 
      nested-PCR with a positive rate of 26.9% that was significantly higher than that of 
      normal control(chi 2 = 14.3, P < 0.001); 4 of 21 HBsAg positive cases were positive 
      for TTV DNA by nested-PCR with a positive rate of 19.0%, also significantly higher 
      than that of normal control(chi 2 = 4.86, P < 0.05). 4 of 7 TTV positive patients 
      with chronic hepatitis B tested by nested-PCR were positive for TTV DNA by ISH in 
      PBMC cytoplasm, with a positive rate of 57.1%. CONCLUSION: (1) A higher incidence of 
      TTV DNA in PBMCs of patients with chronic hepatitis B and in HBsAg positive HCC was 
      identified by nested-PCR and ISH; (2) TTV DNA was in the cytoplasm of PBMCs in 
      patients with chronic hepatitis B.

TI  - Nucleic acid testing for emerging viral infections.
PG  - 275-83
AB  - The development of new technologies leads to the discovery of new viruses. For each 
      of these new infectious agents, relevance to transfusion, including transmissibility 
      by transfusion, pathogenicity, prevalence in blood donors, persistence and the 
      availability of screening assays needs to be assessed. Since 1995, one virus and a 
      new family of viruses have been identified. GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus 
      (GBV-C/HGV), a flavi virus with some homology with and epidemiological features of 
      HCV, is not related to post-transfusion hepatitis but seems to positively interfere 
      with human immunodeficiency virus replication. Human circoviruses include TT virus 
      (TTV) and SEN-V. Both are highly variable, constituting a large family of distantly 
      related viruses. They appear ubiquitous, infecting humans very early in life and are 
      largely persistent. No clinical symptoms or pathogenicity is associated with TTV, 
      but SEN-V might be associated with some non-A-E post-transfusion hepatitis. 
      Parvovirus B19 has been known for many years, but its transmission to recipients of 
      plasma derivatives despite viral inactivation raised the issue of screening plasma 
      pools by nucleic acid testing. Most fractionators quantify B19 DNA in plasma pools 
      to ensure a viral load of <10(4) IU mL-1.

TI  - TT virus infection in acute non-A to E hepatitis in northern Thailand.
PG  - 814-22
AB  - TT virus is a novel DNA virus widely distributed in the general population. We 
      examined the prevalence of TTV infection in a population with acute non-A to E 
      hepatitis and in comparison groups located in Northern Thailand. The prevalence of 
      TTV in subjects with non-A-E hepatitis was 19% (21/112), 6% (4/72) in healthy 
      volunteers, 17% (12/72) in those with hepatitis A or B, and 17% (8/48) in 
      hospitalized patients with non-hepatitis illnesses. A significant association with 
      TTV infection and non-A-E hepatitis was seen in all groups (OR 3.9, p = 0.02) and in 
      children (OR 25.8, p = 0.001). Among subjects with non-A-E hepatitis, TTV was 
      associated with higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase 
      (AST) levels (significant for AST, p = 0.02). Our observations suggest that TTV in 
      our study population may be associated with non-A-E hepatitis and that children in 
      particular may be at risk of hepatocellular injury as a result of TTV infection.

TI  - Detection of TT virus in HIV-1 exposed but uninfected individuals and in HIV-1 
      infected patients and its influence on CD4+ lymphocytes and viral load.
PG  - 33-7
LID - 10.1016/j.micpath.2009.04.010 [doi]
AB  - The TT virus (TTV) was detected for the first time in the serum of a patient with 
      post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown origin. TTV was subsequently, also found in 
      the serum of blood donors with no history of blood transfusion. In the present 
      study, the percentage of TTV carriers among HIV-infected and noninfected patients 
      was determined. The study was conducted to evaluate CD4 count and HIV viral load in 
      100 asymptomatic patients infected with HIV-1, 100 symptomatic patients with AIDS, 
      100 HIV-1 exposed but uninfected individuals and 100 normal healthy blood donors. In 
      this work, the presence of TTV was investigated by nested-PCR. TTV was detected in 
      6% of normal donors, 12.5% of HIV-infected individuals and 21% of exposed 
      individuals. The presence of TTV was statistically significant in the HIV-exposed 
      individuals (21/100) compared with blood donors (6/100). Odds ratio=4.16 (95%CI 
      1.60-10.83). No inter-group relations were found for CD4 and CD8 counts or HIV viral 
      load. In the symptomatic group, patients with TTV presented minor viral load. This 
      work demonstrated that TTV was detected in HIV-exposed individuals and no relation 
      was verified for CD4, CD8 and viral load in the asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV 
      patients.

AB  - Injecting drug users are at increased risk of infection with hepatitis viruses and 
      blood-borne pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine HBV, HCV, HDV, and TTV 
      infections in Saudi drug users (N = 344). Extraction of nucleic acid from serum, 
      reverse-transcription, amplification of viral nucleic acids, and HBV and HCV 
      genotyping were done using established techniques. Of the analyzed samples, 41 (12%) 
      contained detectable HBV DNA, 131 (38%) contained detectable HCV RNA, and 174 (51%) 
      had detectable TTV DNA. The predominant HBV genotype was found to be genotype D and 
      the predominant HCV genotype was found to be genotype 1b. All the samples were 
      negative for HDV. Twelve samples (3.5%) were found to contain mixed HBV and HCV 
      genomes, 24 samples (7%) were found to contain mixed HBV and TTV genomes, 82 samples 
      (24%) were found to contain mixed HCV and TTV genomes, and 9 samples (2.6%) were 
      found to contain mixed HBV, HCV, and TTV genomes. Identification of various 
      infections in drug users will help the control of these infections in this group as 
      well as in the community.

TI  - Searching for unknown transfusion-transmitted hepatitis viruses: a binational cohort 
      study of 1.5 million transfused patients.
PG  - 92-103
LID - 10.1111/joim.12762 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Both hepatitis B and C viruses were transmitted through blood 
      transfusion before implementation of donor screening. The existence of additional, 
      yet unknown transfusion transmittable agents causing liver disease could have 
      important public health implications. METHODS: Analyses were based on the 
      Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions (SCANDAT2) database. Cox regression models 
      were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing chronic liver disease in 
      recipients of blood from donors who later developed any chronic liver disease 
      compared to recipients who received blood transfusion from healthy donors. We also 
      studied whether the risk of liver disease was increased in patients who received 
      units from 'high-risk' donors, defined as donors who had a higher than expected 
      occurrence of liver disease amongst their previous recipients. All analyses were 
      stratified before and after 1992 to account for the effect of screening for 
      hepatitis C virus. RESULTS: A total of 1 482 922 transfused patients were included 
      in the analyses. Analyses showed evidence of transfusion transmission of liver 
      diseases before, but not after the implementation of hepatitis C virus screening in 
      1992, with HRs for any liver disease of 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI), 
      1.30-1.46] and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91-1.07), before and after 1992, respectively. 
      Similarly, blood components from 'high-risk' donors conferred increased risks 
      before, but not after 1992. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide no evidence for 
      transfusion transmission of agents causing liver disease after the implementation of 
      screening for hepatitis B and C, and suggest that if such transmission does occur, 
      it is rare.

TI  - [SEN virus infection in maintenance hemodialysis patients].
PG  - 751-6
AB  - SEN virus (SENV) is a new, mostly parenterally transmitted, hepatotropic agent. The 
      prevalence of SENV among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) in 
      Poland, as well as risk factors for the infection are not established. Serum samples 
      of 91 patients receiving maintenance HD in Białystok were tested for the presence of 
      strain H SENV (SENV-H) DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-one 
      non-dialysis subjects, age- and sex-matched with the HD patients, mostly with 
      chronic kidney diseases (96%), without hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) or the history 
      of blood transfusion and donation served as controls. SENV-H viremia was prevalent 
      in 40% of HD patients and in 2% of control subjects (p < 0.0001). On multivariable 
      logistic analysis, neither age (63.1 +/- 13.2 years), gender (49% females), dialysis 
      vintage (29, 2-200, months), previous transfusions of packed red blood cells (84%) 
      or fresh frozen plasma (4%), seropositivity for HBs antigen (13%), HCV antibodies 
      (23%) or HCV RNA (17%) were independently associated with SENV-H prevalence in HD 
      patients (chi2 for the model = 13.3, p = 0.103). No associations between SENV-H 
      status and clinical or biochemical markers of liver disease, including serum 
      aminotransferases levels were observed. In conclusion, SENV-H viremia is widespread 
      among patients receiving maintenance HD in north-eastern Poland. Risk factors for 
      its occurrence are equivocal; the infection may well be transmitted by parenteral 
      and feco-oral routes. SEN virus is not directly responsible for liver damage in 
      maintenance HD patients.

TI  - Torquetenovirus Dynamics and Immune Marker Properties in Patients Following 
      Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation: A Prospective Longitudinal 
      Study.

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) has been proposed as a marker of immune function in patients 
      receiving immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation. This study aimed to 
      define TTV plasma dynamics and investigate clinical associations in patients 
      following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This was a 
      single-center prospective longitudinal study involving 50 consecutive patients 
      treated with HSCT between March 2015 and April 2016. TTV plasma DNA levels were 
      measured with quantitative PCR at 12 consecutive time points during the first year 
      after HSCT. Forty of the 50 patients (80%) had detectable TTV viremia before HSCT 
      (median level, 5.37 log10 copies/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 3.51-6.44 log10 
      copies/mL). All patients subsequently developed TTV viremia during the follow-up 
      period. Plasma viral loads evolved dynamically over time, with a peak of 8.32 log10 
      copies/mL (IQR, 7.33-9.35 log10 copies/mL) occurring at 79 days (IQR, 50-117 days) 
      following HSCT and a stable plateau toward the end of the follow-up period. The type 
      of malignancy, the use of antithymocyte globulin during conditioning, and the 
      occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease requiring systemic therapy had 
      temporary effects on TTV dynamics. TTV levels showed a significant correlation with 
      absolute lymphocyte counts following engraftment (r(s) = -.27; P < .01) and with 
      cytomegalovirus (CMV; r(s)=.39; P < .01) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; r(s)=.45; 
      P = .02) viral loads during phases of viremia. Immune-related clinical events were 
      not predicted by TTV levels. TTV viremia occurred universally and was sustained 
      throughout the first year after HSCT. Several variables and events before and after 
      HSCT were correlated with TTV levels and hint toward immune marker properties of 
      TTV, but their complex interactions might perturb the capability of TTV to predict 
      immune-related complications in this population.

TI  - Prevalence and partial characterization of genotypes of the human TT virus infecting 
      Portuguese individuals.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - The prevalence and genotype distribution of human TT viruses (TTV) were analyzed in 
      312 Portuguese individuals. Detection of TTV DNA was carried out by polymerase chain 
      reaction (PCR) through the combined use of N22 and UTR-specific primers and revealed 
      a prevalence of infection of 74%. Detection of TTV DNA was not statistically 
      associated to the use of intravenous drugs, infection with HBV, HCV, HIV-1, HIV-1 
      viral load or CD4 cell count (in HIV-1 infected individuals). Our data suggest that, 
      in the population studied, the prevalence of TTV infection does not seem to be 
      related to intravenous viral transmission. Phylogenetic analysis of 49 plasmid 
      clones harboring N22-specific sequences revealed the circulation of genotypes: 1 
      (27%, subtype G1a and G1b), 2 (51%, subtype G2b and G2c) and 4 (22%), as well as 
      multiple genotype infections (G1b-G2b and G1a-G4). To our knowledge, this is the 
      first report of TTV detection and partial characterization of TTV genetic variants 
      in Portuguese individuals. Our results show that TTV infection is widespread in 
      Portugal as in other parts of the world.

TI  - Use of a TT virus ORF1 recombinant protein to detect anti-TT virus antibodies in 
      human sera.
PG  - 2949-2958
LID - 10.1099/0022-1317-81-12-2949 [doi]
AB  - TT virus (TTV), isolated initially from a Japanese patient with hepatitis of unknown 
      aetiology, has since been found to infect both healthy and diseased individuals and 
      numerous prevalence studies have raised questions about its role in unexplained 
      hepatitis. In order to determine the prevalence of ongoing TTV infection as well as 
      resolved infection, a serological study was performed with a recombinant protein 
      generated from the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) sequence isolated from a French 
      patient infected by TTV. The C-terminal end of the ORF1 protein, containing a 
      particularly hydrophilic region, was retained to be used as antigen to detect the 
      presence of anti-TTV antibodies in serum samples by a Western blot analysis. For 
      this purpose, the C-terminal ORF1 region was expressed in fusion with a 
      hexahistidine tail in E. coli and purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. 
      The serological screening of 70 human sera, including 30 patients with hepatitis of 
      unknown aetiology, 30 blood donors and 10 healthy children, allowed the immune 
      response of infected hosts to be identified by the detection of TTV-specific 
      antibodies, with a very high prevalence of 98.6% in the human sera tested. In 
      contrast, TTV DNA was detected by PCR in only 76.1% of the tested sera. The use of 
      the ORF1 C-terminal recombinant protein thereby provided a diagnostic tool to follow 
      the immune response of the host against TTV.

TI  - TT virus infection in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia: natural history 
      and relationship to liver disease in the immunocompromised host.
PG  - 987-93
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered human DNA virus with worldwide 
      distribution, but with no clear disease association. The possibility of an enhanced 
      TTV virulence in patients with immunodeficiencies has not yet been investigated but 
      is of particular interest because other viruses have been demonstrated to cause 
      severe and rapid liver disease in such patients. Here we analysed the 
      characteristics of TTV infection in a large cohort of patients with primary 
      hypogammaglobulinaemia (PHG) and whether TTV has a role in the frequently observed 
      cryptogenic liver disease in these patients. METHODS: 83 Norwegian patients with PHG 
      (serum immunoglobulin G < 2 g/L), receiving substitution treatment with 
      immunoglobulins, were followed regularly for median 10.2 years (range 2-30). TTV DNA 
      was sought in serum samples and three immunoglobulin preparations by polymerase 
      chain reaction; TTV DNA quantitation, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were 
      performed in selected samples. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 27 of 83 (32.5%) 
      patients and was not associated with a particular type of PHG. The prevalence of TTV 
      infection was dependent on intravenous immunoglobulin administration, duration of 
      therapy and patient's age. TTV DNA was found in two of three currently used 
      immunoglobulin preparations. In the longitudinal study, whether TTV was cleared or 
      newly acquired had no impact on liver function tests and no particular TTV strain 
      was found in patients with more severe liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: TTV infection is 
      common in patients with PHG. Treatment with immunoglobulins has a role in the 
      transmission of TTV in these patients. However, we found no evidence of TTV-induced 
      liver disease in this group of immunocompromised patients.

TI  - Prevalence and persistence of TT virus DNA in HIV1-infected individuals.
PG  - 226-31
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered virus with a high DNA prevalence 
      in different populations. Its role in pathogenesis is uncertain, particularly in 
      immunocompromised patients. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prevalence of TTV-DNA was 
      evaluated in a cohort of HIV-infected patients and in blood donors by nested PCR, 
      using two different primer sets: T primers, derived from the open reading frame ORF1 
      region N22; B primers, derived from the untranslated region (UTR). Samples positive 
      using T primers were also tested for TTV-DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells 
      (PBMC) and followed up every 4 months. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of TTV-DNA in 
      HIV-infected patients was 37/376 (9.8%) using T primers and 223/333 (67%) using B 
      primers; prevalence was higher in males (167/237, 70.5% vs 56/96, 58.3%; p = 0.033) 
      and sub-Saharan Africans (22/23, 95.6% vs 201/310, 64.8% in other areas). 
      Discordance was also observed in blood donors: 3.8% prevalence using T primers and 
      51.4% using B primers (also higher in males: 57% vs 37%, p = 0.056). TTV-DNA was 
      detected in PBMC in 20/23 (87%) TTV-positive sera. Two-thirds of the serum samples 
      remained positive over a 2-year follow-up period. CONCLUSION: TTV-DNA prevalence is 
      higher when detected with primers derived from the UTR region and was highest in 
      male and HIV-infected sub-Saharan Africans. TTV-DNA is frequently isolated in PBMC 
      and chronic infection is common.

TI  - Torque teno mini virus infection in chronic cervicitis and cervical tumors in 
      Isfahan, Iran.
PG  - 265-70
LID - 10.1159/000348514 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) is classified as the Betatorquevirus genus 
      of Anelloviridae. Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, 
      cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed 
      to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors 
      including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 
      adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an 
      Isfahan population. METHODS: 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from 
      histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and 
      subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Totally 62% of the tested 
      samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of 
      CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the 
      phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis 
      isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan 
      (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, 
      JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster. CONCLUSION: The presence of 
      the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus.

TI  - The prevalence of TT virus infection in renal transplant recipients in Brazil.
PG  - 1194-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently, TT virus (TTV) was discovered as a potential causative agent 
      for non-A-E hepatitis. Little is known about the prevalence of TTV infection in 
      renal transplant recipients. METHODS: One hundred and seventeen Brazilian renal 
      transplant recipients and 100 normal subjects were examined to determine the 
      prevalence of TTV infection. The TTV DNA in serum and its genotype were examined 
      using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme length polymorphism, 
      respectively. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 63/117 (53.8%) renal transplant 
      recipients in contrast to its detection in 10/100 (10%) normal subjects (P<0.001). 
      There was no statistical difference in the distribution of TTV genotypes between 
      these groups. There was no significant difference in clinical backgrounds between 
      TTV positive and negative patients. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate a risk for 
      TTV infection in renal transplant recipients in Brazil. They also indicate that TTV 
      itself might not have a strong correlation with the pathogenicity of liver diseases.

TI  - Porcine endogenous retrovirus and other viruses in xenotransplantation.
PG  - 175-9
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Potential transmission of zoonotic porcine viruses is a major 
      safety issue in xenotransplantation. This review will first summarize recent studies 
      involving transmission and control of the major concern, porcine endogenous 
      retrovirus (PERV). Second, the potential for zoonotic transfer and safety measures 
      required against other viruses of concern will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: As 
      studies on PERV genomics continue, distribution of PERV, particularly porcine 
      endogenous retrovirus-C in individual pigs in relation to their ability to transmit 
      PERV in vitro, is becoming clearer. However, further study is required to establish 
      pig lines devoid of problematic copies of PERV. As an extra level of safety, several 
      strategies have been sought, with some success, to reduce PERV infectivity and be 
      used to produce transgenic, PERV-suppressed pigs. Porcine herpesviruses, hepatitis E 
      virus, arenaviruses and an Anellovirus, Torque teno virus, have been highlighted as 
      other viruses of potential risk. SUMMARY: Xenotransplantation is a unique situation 
      in which pathogen monitoring may be required to be more comprehensive than that 
      required for specific pathogen-free sources. With evidence of transmission of novel 
      viruses via allotransplantation, significant attention should be paid to emerging 
      and as yet unknown viruses.

TI  - SEN virus infection in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 435-8
AB  - Although most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with either the 
      hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV, HCV), about 10-20% of HCCs occur in patients with 
      chronic hepatitis that is aetiologically undefined. The aim of the present study was 
      to determine the prevalence of the transfusion-transmitted SEN virus (SEN-V) in 
      patients with HCC, including those patients who do not otherwise appear to be 
      infected with HBV or HCV. Fragments of SEN-V subtypes D and H were amplified 
      separately by PCR from the sera of 50 patients with HCC (31 from Canada and 19 from 
      Japan) as well as from HCC and adjacent nontumourous liver tissues from eight of the 
      Canadian patients. SEN-V DNA was found in the serum of 10 of 31 (32%) Canadian 
      patients and eight of 19 (42%) Japanese patients [overall, 18 of 50 (36%) HCC 
      patients]. SEN-V DNA was detected in the serum of 10 of 23 (43%) HCC patients with 
      antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), six of 11 (55%) with hepatitis B surface antigen 
      (HBsAg), and two of 16 (12%) without detectable anti-HCV or HBsAg. Twenty-three HCC 
      patients in this study had 'silent HBV,' characterized by the detection of HBV DNA 
      in the absence of HBsAg; eight of these (35%) also had SEN-V infections. SEN-V DNA 
      was detected in HCC patients most typically in those with coexistent HBV or HCV 
      infection. SEN-V was found in only one of seven HCC patients without HBV (without 
      HBsAg or HBV DNA) or HCV and thus does not appear to be an important cause of 
      'cryptogenic' HCC.

      antibodies against Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1), TTSuV2, porcine reproductive 
      and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) and PRRSV-2 was developed. Serum 
      samples were obtained over time from 20 pigs. Twelve of 20 were exposed to TTSuV2 on 
      day 0, 20/20 were vaccinated with a PRRSV-2 vaccine on day 35, and 20/20 were 
      exposed to PRRSV-2 on day 63. Anti-TTSuV antibodies were detected in 30% of the pigs 
      on day 0, and 90% by day 35. All PRRSV-2 vaccinated pigs had detectable anti-PRRSV-2 
      IgG 21 days after vaccination. Field samples from 17 farms were also tested. The 
      seroprevalence of both PRRSV and TTSuV increased with age. Comparison of the PRRSV-2 
      FMIA to an ELISA revealed good correlation in young pigs but a high rate of false 
      positives in older pigs. Cross-reaction between PRRSV types was a problem.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus is not present in factor IX concentrates commonly used 
      to treat haemophilia B.
PG  - 732-4
AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a potential cause of post-transfusion 
      hepatitis in patients with haemophilia. Plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates 
      currently undergo processes that are effective in removal and inactivation of 
      viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and C; however, their effectiveness with respect to 
      TTV is unknown. To determine if TTV DNA is present in plasma-derived concentrates of 
      factor IX, we tested 14 lots of Mononine and compared the results with BeneFix. 
      Nucleic acid isolation, followed by a two-round polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and 
      agarose gel analysis indicated that all 17 lots were negative for TTV. Although TTV 
      may be considered an emerging pathogen, no evidence of the virus was detected in the 
      commercially available plasma-derived concentrate of FIX most commonly used to treat 
      haemophilia B.

TI  - TT virus infection in patients on maintenance hemodialysis in Korea.
PG  - 170-3
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: TT virus is a novel DNA virus that is associated with 
      posttransfusion hepatitis. The prevalence, risk factors, and clinical significance 
      of TT virus infection were evaluated in patients with chronic renal failure who are 
      on hemodialysis. METHODOLOGY: Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to test for 
      TT virus DNA in the serum of patients on hemodialysis as well as in healthy 
      controls. RESULTS: TT virus DNA was detected in 15 (20.0%) of the 75 patients on 
      hemodialysis and 10 (13.2%) of the 76 healthy controls (P > 0.05). In chronic renal 
      failure patients on hemodialysis, the prevalence of TT virus did not differ 
      according to the duration of hemodialysis or the amount of blood transfusion. The 
      prevalence of TT virus was higher in IgG anti-hepatitis B core antibody-positive 
      patients than IgG anti-hepatitis B core antibody-negative patients (27.5% vs. 4.2%, 
      P = 0.03). Two (13.3%) of the 15 TT virus-positive and 6 (10.0%) of the 60 TT 
      virus-negative patients showed elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (P > 0.05). 
      CONCLUSIONS: TT virus infection did not occur more frequently in patients on 
      hemodialysis than in healthy controls. No relationship was found between TT virus 
      infection and liver disease. The correlation between TT virus infection and IgG 
      anti-hepatitis B core antibody suggests that TT virus may share some routes of 
      transmission with hepatitis B virus.

TI  - Lack of effect of piglet vaccination against Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) on 
      serum viral loads of Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2).
PG  - 8-12
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.11.028 [doi]
AB  - Anelloviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with circular single stranded DNA, 
      which infect a number of animal species as well as humans. In pigs, two distinct 
      Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species have been described so far, being one of them 
      linked to disease occurrence. Specifically, TTSuV2 loads in serum have been found 
      increased in pigs suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). 
      Since this pathological condition is able to be controlled by means of porcine 
      circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccination, it was hypothesized the possibility that such 
      vaccination would have an impact on TTSuV2 prevalence and loads. A total of 150 pigs 
      were divided in two study groups. Half of them received a PCV2 commercial vaccine, 
      while the other half remained as non-vaccinated controls. PCV2 infection was 
      monitored at 3-4, 8, 12, 16 and 21 weeks of age by means of an standard PCR, while 
      TTSuV2 loads were determined at 8, 16 and 21 weeks of age by a quantitative PCR. No 
      obvious PMWS clinical signs were observed among studied animals, although PCV2 
      infection was confirmed in both groups of pigs. Almost all pigs got TTSuV2 infection 
      throughout the study period, independently of the PCV2 vaccination status of 
      animals. Moreover, TTSuV2 load did not show significant differences between 
      different pig groups at each sampling time, but mean viral load increased with age. 
      Taking into account that previous results suggest that TTSuV2 load in serum is 
      increased in the background of PMWS, the present study suggests that this is not the 
      case in a PCV2 subclinical infection scenario. Therefore, vaccination of PCV2 
      subclinically infected pigs did not modify the outcome of TTSuV2 infection.

TI  - [Prevalence of TT virus in patients with hepatitis B,C and hepatitis of unknown 
      etiology].
PG  - 151-5
AB  - Discovery of TT virus in 1997 gave raise to intensive subsequent studies to learn 
      about its structure, features and, what is the most important, about its role in 
      pathogenesis of liver disease. The aim of the work was to analyze prevalence of TTV 
      DNA in patients with diagnosed hepatitis B, C, that of unknown etiology and in 
      healthy blood donors as well. Additionally the divergence of TTV sequence was 
      estimated in selected cases. TTV DNA was detected by PCR technique using specific 
      oligonucleotide primers for coding regions. TT virus has been detected in 25.6% 
      (32/125) HBsAg positive patients and in 23.9% (51/213) HCV infected patients. In 
      healthy blood donors the frequency of TTV was 24.3% (34/140) similarly to that found 
      in HCV and HBV infected patients. The frequency of TTV DNA among patients with 
      hepatitis of unknown etiology was 9.1%. This result was statistically significant 
      lower than in the other groups. When detected sequences have been compared to these 
      from NCBI base the homology result was 71% to 95%, and among different patients and 
      groups of patients identity was 46% to 73%. On the basis of the obtained results it 
      can be concluded that it is very unlikely that TTV coinfection plays any significant 
      role in HCV or HBV infection. The hypothetical role of TTV infection in the 
      etiopathogenesis of cryptogenic chronic hepatitis has not been confirmed. The 
      results obtained in the small group of patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology 
      are not conclusive and should be taken with some precaution. The final conclusion is 
      the TTV coinfection does not contribute to the liver pathology. The divergence of 
      TTV sequences may explain the various frequency of TTV viremia reported by other 
      authors.

TI  - Experimental infection of a novel nonenveloped DNA hepatitis virus in Rhesus monkey.
PG  - 240-3, 301
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of the Rhesus monkey to the TT virus and to 
      establish its transmission route. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were administered orally 
      and intravenously with the inoculum that was prepared with feces collected from a 
      patient at the incubation period. Passage study was done with monkey' s positive 
      feces. The blood, bile and feces were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), 
      and the liver, the jejunum tissues with in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The viremia 
      occurred 4-7 days after intravenous inoculation and 7-10 days after oral 
      administration. The virus was also excreted in the feces in a few days after oral 
      infection and simultaneously with viremia after intravenous inoculation. The virus 
      was also detected in the bile during the viremic phase. There was a prolonged 
      carrier state that the viremia and fecal virus excretion persisted for more than 6 
      months. No serum transaminase elevation was found during the infection. There were 
      virus signals in hepatocytes in columnar epithelium and lamina propria cells of 
      jejunum villi, but no significant pathology was demonstrated in both sites. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The liver infection of Rhesus monkey was established hb either oral or 
      parenteral virus Inoculation. The virus may be released from liver into blood and 
      intestine vial the bile or just from the gut wall into feces, and hence it may be 
      transmitted by both routes.

TI  - Prevalence of hepatitis B, hepatitis C, GB virus C/hepatitis G and TT viruses in 
      predialysis and hemodialysis patients.
PG  - 103-7
AB  - Patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis have a high risk of infections 
      with viruses such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), GB virus C/hepatitis G 
      (GBV-C/HGV) and TT (TTV) viruses. The prevalence of HBV, HCV, GBV-C/HGV and TTV in 
      patients with chronic renal failure who are on conservative management before 
      entering into a hemodialysis program (predialysis) in comparison with hemodialyzed 
      patients was studied to elucidate whether the high prevalence of these viruses is 
      influenced by that observed in the predialysis stage. The presence of hepatitis B 
      virus surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and TTV DNA was analyzed in 
      sera from 80 patients with chronic renal failure (35 on predialysis and 45 on 
      hemodialysis). HBsAg, HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected in one 
      (2.8%), six (17.1%), eight (22.5%) and 16 (45.7%) of the 35 patients on predialysis. 
      Two (5.7%) of these patients were coinfected with HCV and GBV-C/HGV, whereas six 
      (17.1%) had GBV-C/HGV and TTV coinfection. In the 45 hemodialyzed patients, HBsAg, 
      HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected in one (2.2%), two (4.4%), seven 
      (15.5%) and 26 (57.7%). One (2.2%) patient had HBV and TTV coinfection, two (4.4%) 
      HCV and TTV coinfection whereas four (8.8%) were coinfected with GBV-C/HGV and TTV. 
      No differences regarding age, gender, previous surgery and number of transfusions 
      were found between infected and uninfected patients within and between both groups. 
      In conclusion, the prevalence of the viruses studied in predialysis may influence 
      their prevalence in dialysis units.

AB  - Understanding immunosenescence and changes in antimicrobial immune response with age 
      is of high importance. The association of immunosenescence with gender and 
      persistent infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a matter of intensive 
      research. We determined whether replication of another persistent and highly 
      prevalent virus, Torque teno virus (TTV), is related to age, gender, and HCMV IgG 
      serostatus of the host. TTV DNA load in plasma was assessed by real-time PCR in 313 
      healthy persons: 20-30 years old (young, n = 104), 50-60 years old (middle-aged, 
      n = 101), or >80 years old (elderly, n = 108). TTV DNA loads were further associated 
      with age-groups, gender, and HCMV IgG serostatus. TTV load was significantly higher 
      in the elderly compared to the young group (p < 0.001; Tukey's honest significant 
      difference (HSD)), and the higher TTV DNA levels over age were found to be 
      gender-specific (p = 0.002; ANOVA), with young women showing the lowest TTV load 
      compared to young men (p = 0.009, t test) and compared to the other female 
      age-groups (middle-aged p = 0.005; elderly p < 0.001; Tukey's HSD). TTV load of HCMV 
      IgG-seropositive persons was significantly higher than that of the HCMV IgG 
      seronegative in the young (p = 0.005; t test) and middle-aged (p = 0.016; t test) 
      groups. These results indicate that the host's immune control of TTV replication 
      decreases with age and is gender-specific. Persistent HCMV infection is 
      significantly related to higher TTV DNA loads, especially at a younger age. 
      Therefore, the influence of gender and HCMV on immunosenescence earlier in life 
      should be further explored.

TI  - [Role of TT virus in pathogenesis of liver diseases--the prevalence of TTV in 
      patients and healthy individuals].
PG  - 101-13
AB  - Primarily TTV has been thought as an etiologic agent of post transfusion non-A to -G 
      hepatitis. TTV can replicate in liver and bone marrow cells. The presence of TTV has 
      been found in the serum of patients with acute as well as chronic hepatitis of known 
      etiology. Patients with acute hepatitis A, B, C and hepatitis caused by EBV or CMV 
      all have TTV viremia in a frequency up to 60%. In chronic viral hepatitis TTV was 
      present in a wide range of 7-94.4%. Treatment of viral hepatitis patients with 
      interferon alfa and rybawiryn leads to eradication of TTV viremia in 50% cases. TTV 
      infection in hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 8.1% up to 100% patients. In 
      hepatitis of unknown etiology TTV infection was observed in 26% to 71% cases. In 
      liver cirrhosis TTV infection has been evidenced in 10% to 66% patients. Some 
      authors postulated that the frequency of TTV increased with the number of blood or 
      blood products transfusions. Coinfection of TTV has been found in 34.9%-76% of HIV 
      positive persons. The study of medical staff revealed no difference in TTV viremia 
      with healthy individual control. TTV is widespread in healthy general population. 
      Therefore based on so far published results the association between TTV infection 
      and hepatitis is questionable.

TI  - Influence of TT virus co-infection on IFN-beta therapy in patients with chronic 
      hepatitis C.
PG  - 747-53
AB  - Although results of IFN alpha therapy in chronic hepatitis C (C-CH) patients 
      co-infected with TT virus (TTV) have been reported, no results of IFN beta therapy 
      or IFN beta and alpha combination therapy have been reported. In this study, we 
      retrospectively investigated whether co-infection with TTV affects the results of 
      IFN therapy by using stored sera from 60 C-CH patients co-infected with TTV who 
      underwent IFN beta therapy or IFN beta and alpha combination therapy. The stored 
      sera were from 29 complete responders, 10 incomplete responders, and 21 
      non-responders, and they were used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of HCV 
      RNA, HCV genotype analysis, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of TTV DNA. 
      TTV DNA was detected in 23 (38.3%) of the 60 C-CH sera. The TTV DNA-positive rate 
      was 17.2% among the complete responders to IFN therapy, versus 58.1% in the 
      incomplete responders and non-responders, and the difference was significant (p < 
      0.01). While the complete response prediction rate based on two factors, HCV RNA 
      level and HCV genotype, was 80.8% (21/26) in the C-CH patients, the prediction rate 
      based on three factors, these two factors plus TTV DNA, was higher, 90.0% (18/20). 
      It was concluded that determination of HCV RNA concentration, HCV genotype, and TTV 
      DNA, before IFN beta therapy or IFN beta and alpha combination therapy is useful for 
      predicting the results of treatment of C-CH patients.

AB  - The Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) is a small virus with circular single-stranded 
      DNA that has been reported to cause infections in dogs. The present study aimed to 
      identify the presence of TTCaV in blood samples obtained from domestic dogs, and 
      examine its diversity and evolution of the genomes. Five strains of TTCaV were 
      detected, and the overall prevalence was found to be 7% (28/400). Phylogenetic 
      analysis showed that the five genomes were closely clustered with the previously 
      known Cf-TTV10 and LDL strains and formed a Thetatorque virus. Homology analysis of 
      the whole genome showed a sequence identity of 94.6%-96.8% among the five genomes. 
      The percent sequence similarity among the five complete genomes ranged from 95.3% to 
      97.4% and from 95.1% to 97% compared to the Cf-TTV10 and LDL strains respectively. 
      The ORF1-encoded amino acid sequences showed 94.4%-97.2% identity among the five 
      isolates. Our findings suggest that the TTCaV has a large genetic diversity and 
      showed that TTCaV and canine parvovirus (CPV) co-infection exists in China. Further 
      studies on the pathogenicity of TTCaV are required.

TI  - Prevalence and determinants of SENV viremia among adolescents in an endemic area of 
      chronic liver diseases.
PG  - 171-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: SENV is a potential causative agent responsible for chronic liver 
      diseases (CLDs) that are precipitated in early life. SENV prevalence in adolescents 
      is unknown and its transmission route is uncertain. METHODS: We randomly selected 
      824 serum samples from a cohort of 2383 adolescents aged 15-17 years who resided in 
      Hualien County, an endemic area of liver diseases. Serum SENV genotype-D and 
      genotype-H DNA were assayed by seminested polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The 
      positive rates for SENV-D and SENV-H DNA were 25.1% and 30.6%, respectively. Amis 
      adolescents had a significantly higher rate of SENV-D viremia than Han Chinese 
      adolescents (31.0%vs 22.2%; P = 0.025). Adolescents residing in rural or mountainous 
      areas had significantly higher rates of SENV-H viremia than those residing in urban 
      areas. There was no difference in the positive rates of SENV-D and SENV-H DNA among 
      adolescents with or without hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
      infection or history of hospitalization, surgery or blood transfusion. In 
      multivariate analyses, males and adolescents residing in rural or mountainous areas 
      had significantly higher risks of SENV-H viremia. As compared with those residing in 
      urban areas, the multivariate-adjusted odds ratio (OR) for rural and mountainous 
      areas were 1.49 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.08-2.07) and 2.16 (95% CI, 
      1.32-3.53), respectively. CONCLUSION: SENV-D and SENV-H infection were frequent 
      among adolescents in eastern Taiwan. SENV was unlikely to be transmitted via the 
      parenteral route and factors associated with level of urbanization were probably the 
      major determinants of SENV infection.

TI  - Torquetenovirus infection and ciliary dysmotility in children with recurrent 
      pneumonia.
PG  - 413-8
LID - 10.1097/INF.0b013e318162a14f [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to assess Torquetenovirus (TTV) loads within 
      respiratory ciliated cells and to verify the existence of a correlation between TTV 
      loads and functional or structural ciliary abnormalities, in a group of children 
      with recurrent or persistent pneumonia. METHODS: Nasal brushing samples of 55 
      children (28 male) were evaluated for ciliary motion and ultrastructural assessment, 
      as well as for detection and quantification of TTV. Moreover, presence and load of 
      TTV within ciliated cells, obtained from 5 patients by laser capture 
      microdissection, were determined. RESULTS: The nasal samples of 47 (85%) children 
      with persistent or recurrent pneumonia resulted positive for TTV (loads = 2.1-7.3 
      log10 copies/microg total DNA). TTV were demonstrated also within microdissected 
      ciliated cells. No significant difference between primary (11 subjects) and 
      secondary ciliary dyskinesia (44 subjects) for TTV prevalence and mean loads were 
      found. A significant correlation was observed between nasal TTV loads and ciliary 
      beat frequency score (r = 0.305; P < 0.05), but not between TTV loads and presence 
      of abnormal motion patterns, in patients with secondary ciliary abnormalities. As 
      expected no correlations were found between nasal TTV loads and ciliary motion 
      analysis in primary ciliary dyskinesia. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of TTV in nasal 
      samples demonstrates TTV ability to infect respiratory ciliated cells and suggests 
      that these cells are potentially able to support virus replication. Moreover, TTV 
      may behave in respiratory cells in a similar way to other viruses, that is, they 
      disrupt the mucociliary escalator.

TI  - [A clinical prospective study on maternal-fetal transfusion transmitted virus 
      infection].
PG  - 277-8
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection rate in 
      gravidas and parturients, and explore the route of maternal-fetal transmission. 
      METHODS: TTV infection was detected by nest-polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) in the 
      serum of 60 healthy gravidas and parturientes. Once parturient infection was 
      identified, the latices and the umbilical blood were examined for TTV infection as 
      well. Meanwhile, a group of non-pregnant healthy women was tested as control. 
      RESULTS: The infection rate of observation group was 28.33%, while in the control 
      group it was 7.57%. The difference of the two groups was significant (P < 0.001). Of 
      the TTV positive parturientes, TTV infection rate of their latices was 27.27%, but 
      none of the umbilical blood samples showed TTV positive. CONCLUSIONS: The TTV 
      infection rate of gravidas and parturientes is higher than that of non-pregnant 
      healthy women. TTV can infect newborns through latices, however, there is no 
      vertical maternal-fetal transmission.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: New biomarkers reflecting the degree of immunosuppression in transplant 
      recipients are needed to provide an optimal personalized balance between rejection 
      and infection risks. METHODS: For this purpose, we investigated TTV viremia dynamics 
      in 66 kidney transplant recipients followed up for two years after transplantation, 
      in relation to BK virus infection and graft rejection. RESULTS: After 
      transplantation, TTV viremia rose by ≥2 log(10) copies/mL from baseline to month 3, 
      then declined by ≥1 log(10) copies/mL thereafter. Higher TTV viremia was associated 
      with recipients of a deceased donor, a lower count of CD8+ T cells and a higher BKV 
      viremia. Importantly, TTV loads were significantly lower in KTR who would later 
      display graft rejection; indeed, patients with TTV viremia lower than 3.4 log(10) 
      copies/mL at transplantation or lower than 4.2 log(10) copies/mL at month 1 had a 
      higher risk of developing graft rejection in the two following years (hazard ratio 
      (HR) at D0 = 7.30, p = 0.0007 and HR at M1 = 6.16, p = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: TTV 
      viremia measurement at early times post transplantation predicts graft rejection and 
      would represent a useful tool to improve kidney transplant monitoring.

TI  - SEN virus infection among patients on maintenance hemodialysis in southern Taiwan.
PG  - 110-5
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The prevalence and clinical significance of two SEN virus (SENV) 
      strains, SENV-D and SENV-H, was investigated among patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis in southern Taiwan. METHODS: Sera from 99 uremic patients were tested 
      for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C 
      virus antibody (anti-HCV), and SENV-D and -H DNA. Sera from 120 healthy blood donors 
      were tested as a control group. RESULTS: Of the 99 patients, 24.2 and 7.1% were 
      positive for anti-HCV and HBsAg, respectively, and the prevalence of SENV-D and/or 
      -H (SENV-D/H), SENV-D and SENV-H DNA was 61.6, 46.5 and 27.3%, which was 
      significantly higher than for donors (23.3, 18.3, and 5.8%, respectively; all 
      P<0.0001). Patients with SENV-D DNA had significantly higher mean age among both 
      patients (P=0.019) and donors (P=0.015). Mean serum ALT levels were significantly 
      higher among patients with anti-HCV (P=0.003) and patients with SENV-D and -H 
      concurrent infection (P=0.034). By multivariate analyses, the presence of serum 
      anti-HCV and concurrent SENV-D and -H infection were independent factors associated 
      with increased ALT level. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of SENV-D/H infection is high 
      among Taiwanese patients on maintenance hemodialysis with SENV-D more prevalent than 
      SENV-H. The ALT level was associated with not only positive anti-HCV but also 
      concomitant viremia of both SENV-D and SENV-H.

TI  - High prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus infection in patients with chronic 
      liver diseases in an endemic area of hepatitis B and C virus.
PG  - 176-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence and clinical impact of 
      transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) DNA in patients with chronic liver diseases in 
      the Southeast Anatolia region of Turkey where hepatitis B and C viral infections are 
      endemic. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease by 
      clinical, biochemical and histologic means were enrolled in the study. Serum samples 
      of 60 patients (19 males, 41 females) with chronic liver diseases, and of 45 healthy 
      volunteer blood donors as a control group were collected. The chronic liver disease 
      group consisted of 11 patients with hepatitis B, 44 with hepatitis C and 5 with 
      chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. Presence of TTV DNA was investigated by 
      the polymerase chain reaction. Using a scoring system histological grading of 
      inflammation and staging of fibrosis were performed only in the chronic hepatitis C 
      group. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 47 (78%) patients with chronic liver disease 
      and 5 (11%) volunteers in the control group. The difference was statistically 
      significant (p < 0.001). Ten of the 11 (91%) patients with hepatitis B, 32 of 44 
      (73%) of those with hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease, and 5 of 5 (100%) of 
      the patients with cryptogenic liver disease were positive for TTV DNA. CONCLUSION: 
      TTV is highly prevalent in patients with chronic liver diseases in Southeast 
      Anatolia, Turkey but no pathogenic effect attributable to TTV infection was 
      detected.

TI  - Impact of TTV and SENV infection in chronic hepatitis B or C on liver histology and 
      therapy outcome.
PG  - 629-34
AB  - AIM: To determine the influence of TTV and SENV on histological findings and viral 
      response in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. BACKGROUND: The clinical 
      impact of TTV or SENV coinfections in these patients remains unclear. METHODS: Serum 
      and liver biopsy specimens from chronic hepatitis B and C patients, 107 with liver 
      biopsy and 105 who had finished complete antiviral therapy, were investigated for 
      the presence of TTV and SENV. RESULTS: The Ishak score determined from 107 liver 
      biopsy samples compared according to TTV or SENV coinfection was similar. Among 39 
      chronic hepatitis C patients with and 43 without virological response, we have found 
      9 and 3 SENV positive (p < 0.05) and 18 and 28 TTV positive patients, respectively 
      (not significant). However 11 of 32 biopsy samples obtained in the responder's group 
      and 19 of 31 in non-responders were TTV positive (p < 0.05). No similar differences 
      were observed among 23 chronic hepatitis B patients. TTV clearance after interferon 
      therapy exceeded 80%, clearance of SENV 90%. CONCLUSION: TTV or SENV infections did 
      not negatively influence the severity of histological features or the antiviral 
      response in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. Both viruses were highly 
      sensitive to interferon therapy (Tab. 5, Ref. 29).

TI  - Histopathologic impact of TT virus infection on the liver of type C chronic 
      hepatitis and liver cirrhosis in Japan.
PG  - 74-81
AB  - The present investigation compared the histological findings in the liver of chronic 
      hepatitis C patients who were or were not co-infected with TT virus (TTV) to 
      determine the histological and clinical characteristics of TTV infection. One 
      hundred eighty patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis type C were 
      included in this study. Serum samples were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by a 
      nested polymerase chain reaction. The liver biopsy specimen of each patient was 
      examined, and scores were assigned to indicate the severity of each of the following 
      features: inflammatory cell infiltration in the periportal, parenchymal, and portal 
      areas; fibrous stage; lymphoid reaction in the portal area; portal sclerotic change; 
      perivenular fibrosis; pericellular fibrosis; damage of bile duct; and irregular 
      regeneration of hepatocytes. Sixty-four (34.4%) of the 180 patients were positive 
      for TTV DNA. The histological features of the liver and the blood biochemical 
      parameters of the TTV DNA-positive and TTV DNA-negative patients, did not differ 
      significantly except for the score of irregular regeneration (IR) of hepatocytes. 
      Among those in the F4 stage of fibrosis, the score of IR of the TTV DNA-positive 
      patients was significantly higher than that of the TTV DNA-negative patients. In 
      conclusion, chronic TTV infection does not modify the biochemical features of 
      chronic hepatitis type C patients. TTV may be a risk factor, however, for the 
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with type C liver disease in the 
      F4 stage.

TI  - The Perioperative Lung Transplant Virome: Torque Teno Viruses Are Elevated in Donor 
      Lungs and Show Divergent Dynamics in Primary Graft Dysfunction.
PG  - 1313-1324
LID - 10.1111/ajt.14076 [doi]
AB  - Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a principal cause of early morbidity and 
      mortality after lung transplantation, but its pathogenic mechanisms are not fully 
      clarified. To date, studies using standard clinical assays have not linked microbial 
      factors to PGD. We previously used comprehensive metagenomic methods to characterize 
      viruses in lung allografts >1 mo after transplant and found that levels of 
      Anellovirus, mainly torque teno viruses (TTVs), were significantly higher than in 
      nontransplanted healthy controls. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to 
      analyze TTV and shotgun metagenomics to characterize full viral communities in 
      acellular bronchoalveolar lavage from donor organs and postreperfusion allografts in 
      PGD and non-PGD lung transplant recipient pairs. Unexpectedly, TTV DNA levels were 
      elevated 100-fold in donor lungs compared with healthy adults (p = 0.0026). Although 
      absolute TTV levels did not differ by PGD status, PGD cases showed a smaller 
      increase in TTV levels from before to after transplant than did control recipients 
      (p = 0.041). Metagenomic sequencing revealed mainly TTV and bacteriophages of 
      respiratory tract bacteria, but no viral taxa distinguished PGD cases from controls. 
      These findings suggest that conditions associated with brain death promote TTV 
      replication and that greater immune activation or tissue injury associated with PGD 
      may restrict TTV abundance in the lung.

TI  - TT virus infection in Thailand: prevalence in blood donors and patients with 
      aplastic anemia.
PG  - 325-8
AB  - Aplastic anemia has been reported to occur after viral hepatitis of unknown 
      etiology. Recently, TT virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus, was identified in a Japanese 
      patient with posttransfusion non-A-E hepatitis. The prevalence of TTV infection was 
      investigated among blood donors and patients with aplastic anemia in Thailand. Of 99 
      blood samples from blood donors, 37 tested positive for TTV DNA via semi-nested 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TTV-specific primers. Seventeen percent of 
      samples from blood donors younger than 20 were positive for TTV DNA, whereas 48% 
      from donors older than 20 were positive. The high prevalence of TTV infection in 
      Thailand is comparable to that reported in China (28%), Mongolia (43%), and Egypt 
      (29%). Forty-two percent of newly diagnosed aplastic anemia patients tested also had 
      TTV DNA in blood. The detection rate of TTV DNA in aplastic anemia patients does not 
      differ significantly from rates in normal blood donors. Our present data thus argue 
      against the role of this novel hepatitis-associated virus in the pathogenesis of 
      aplastic anemia in Thailand. However, larger epidemiological studies may be needed 
      to further evaluate their association.

TI  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) load is associated with mortality in Italian elderly subjects.

AB  - An age-related dysregulation of immune response, known as immunosenescence, 
      contributes to increased susceptibility to infections, frailty and high risk of 
      mortality in the elderly. Torquetenovirus (TTV), a circular, single-stranded DNA 
      virus, is highly prevalent in the general population and it may persist in the 
      organism, also in association with other viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), 
      causing chronic viremia. The relationship that TTV establishes with the immune 
      system of infected hosts is not clear. It is known that TTV encodes microRNAs 
      (miRNAs) that might contribute to immune evasion and that the highest viral loads 
      are found in peripheral blood cells. Moreover, it is suspected that TTV infection 
      lead to increased production of inflammatory mediators, thus playing a role in 
      immunosenescence. We investigated the association of TTV load and miRNAs expression 
      with inflammatory and immune markers and the influence of TTV load on mortality 
      within a cohort of 379 elderly subjects who were followed up for 3 years. TTV DNA 
      load in polymorphonuclear leukocytes was slightly positively correlated with age and 
      negatively associated with serum albumin levels and NK cell activity. A marginal 
      positive correlation between TTV DNA load, monocytes and IL-8 plasma levels was 
      found in females and males respectively. TTV DNA copies ≥4.0 log represented a 
      strong predictor of mortality (Hazard ratio = 4.78, 95% CI: 1.70-13.44, after 
      adjusting for age, sex and the main predictors of mortality rate) and this 
      association remained significant even after the CMV IgG antibody titer was included 
      in the model (HR = 9.83; 95% CI: 2.48-38.97; N = 343 subjects). Moreover, multiple 
      linear regression model showed that TTV miRNA-t3b of genogroup 3 was inversely 
      associated with triglycerides, monocytes and C-reactive protein, and directly 
      associated with IL6. Overall these findings suggest a role of TTV in 
      immunesenescence and in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk in Italian 
      elderly subjects. Further studies are needed to fully understand the pathogenic 
      mechanisms of TTV infection during aging.

      lung cancer.
PG  - 263-9
LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1843.2007.01217.x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: IPF is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, but the 
      mechanism of this association has not fully been elucidated. The role of Torque teno 
      virus (TTV) in respiratory disease is poorly understood, although it has been shown 
      that infection with TTV is associated with the activity and prognosis of IPF. This 
      study aimed to investigate the prevalence and titre of TTV DNA among patients with 
      IPF and lung cancer. METHODS: The presence of TTV DNA was determined by PCR in the 
      sera of patients with both lung cancer and IPF (n = 22), patients with IPF only (n = 
      35), and patients with lung cancer only (n = 142). RESULTS: TTV DNA was detectable 
      in all patients with both IPF and lung cancer, in 94.3% of the patients with IPF 
      only and 97.2% of the patients with lung cancer only. The TTV DNA titre in the 
      patients with IPF and lung cancer was significantly higher than that in the patients 
      with IPF only or lung cancer only. The percentage of TTV-positive patients with a 
      high TTV titre in the IPF and lung cancer group was significantly higher than that 
      in the IPF only group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are the first report on the 
      association between TTV and the complication of lung cancer in IPF and suggest that 
      TTV infection might be associated with the development of lung cancer in IPF.

TI  - TTV infection in children with and without liver disease.
PG  - 135-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: TTV DNA has been reported in patients with a broad spectrum of hepatic 
      disorders as well as in healthy people. AIM: To clarify the role of TTV in children 
      with liver disease and in healthy children. METHODS: Degenerate primers designed to 
      amplify a target sequence from the ORF 1 region of TTV genome were used for nested 
      PCR, to detect TTV DNA in sera. RESULTS: TTV was detected in 3 of 18 children with 
      chronic hepatitis B (16.7%), 2 of 17 hepatitis B carriers (11.8%), 2 of 17 children 
      with cryptogenic chronic liver disease (11.8%), and 1 of 40 (2.5%) children without 
      liver disease. The infection rate was similar among the various study groups and in 
      the various age groups. There was no difference between TTV positive and negative 
      children in respect to gender, history of surgery, parenteral treatment, transfusion 
      of blood and blood products, presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, and 
      transaminase values. CONCLUSION: TTV does not seem to have an etiologic role in 
      cryptogenic liver disease in children and does not seem to influence the clinical 
      course of liver disease.

TI  - Helicobacter pylori and TT virus prevalence in Japanese children.
PG  - 1126-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: The major transmission route of Helicobacter pylori, oral-oral or 
      fecal-oral, remains to be established. TT virus (TTV), a recently discovered microbe 
      that is prevalent in healthy persons, is believed to be mainly transmitted by 
      nonparenteral routes. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that 
      these two microorganisms have a common mode of transmission. METHODS: We 
      investigated the seroprevalence of H. pylori and TTV in a cross-sectional study of 
      454 healthy Japanese children from birth to age 15 years, living in five different 
      geographic areas. Determination of H. pylori status was based on the presence of 
      specific serum IgG and IgA antibodies, determined using enzyme immunoassays. TTV DNA 
      was detected and the titer was determined using semiquantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction with heminested primers. RESULTS: The overall prevalences of H. pylori and 
      TTV were 12.2% and 21.6%, respectively. An age-related increase of prevalence was 
      shown for H. pylori ( P < 0.001), but not for TTV ( P = 0.23). Titers of TTV DNA 
      significantly decreased with age (P = 0.02). There were significant geographic 
      differences in TTV prevalence ( P < 0.001), but not in H. pylori seroprevalence (P = 
      0.33). There was no true correlation between the prevalence of these two organisms 
      (Phi coefficient = -0.02 and P = 0.66). CONCLUSIONS: Although Japanese children 
      frequently acquire both H. pylori and TTV, especially in early childhood, their 
      acquisition appears to be independent.

TI  - Prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus infection and its effect on renal graft 
      survival in renal transplant recipients.
PG  - 473-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Little is known about the prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus 
      (TTV) infection in renal transplant recipients (RTxs) and its effects on allograft 
      survival. We investigated the prevalence of TTV and its effects on liver injury and 
      graft survival in RTxs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was performed in 33 
      consecutive RTxs (8 females, 25 males) and 100 blood donors (35 females, 65 males). 
      A nested polymerase chain reaction was used to detect TTV DNA in serum. Serum 
      creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and 24-h protein excretion were 
      determined in both TTV-positive and-negative patients. The total number of blood 
      transfusions, the duration of hemodialysis and the total duration after 
      transplantation were recorded in RTxs. In addition, hepatitis B surface antigen 
      (HbsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis G virus DNA antibodies were 
      determined in all patients. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 51.5% of RTxs and in 7% 
      of the control group and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). 
      In the RTx group, 64.7% of TTV-positive and 56.2% of TTV-negative patients had 
      undergone a previous blood transfusion. However, the blood transfusion replacement 
      rate, total duration of dialysis therapy and posttransplant period did not differ 
      between these two groups. Five (15.1%) patients in the RTx group had abnormal liver 
      function tests (ALT >40 IU/l). Of these patients, 2 were anti-HCV-positive, 1 was 
      HBsAg-positive and anti-HCV- plus TTV DNA-positive and the serologic tests of the 
      remaining 2 patients were all negative. Among the TTV-positive patients, 2 (11.7%) 
      were anti-HCV-positive, 1 (5.8%) was HBsAg-positive and 3 (17.6%) were HGV 
      DNA-positive. The baseline serum creatinine levels did not differ significantly 
      between the TTV-positive and-negative patients, being 1.5 +/- 0.6 and 1.4 +/- 0.6 
      mg/dl, respectively ( p > 0.05). Two of the TTV-positive patients and 1 of the 
      TTV-negative patients had proteinuria. A 1-year follow-up of TTV-positive 
      and-negative patients demonstrated neither acute nor chronic graft rejection. 
      CONCLUSION: In RTxs, TTV infection was more prevalent than in the normal population. 
      In our patients the virus did not have an important effect on renal graft rejection 
      and did not cause liver injury. However, the question of whether TTV infection may 
      affect graft survival requires further long-term investigation in larger groups.

TI  - Role of transfusion-transmitted virus in acute viral hepatitis and fulminant hepatic 
      failure of unknown etiology.
PG  - 406-12
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The role of the newly described transfusion-transmitted virus 
      (TTV), a circular single-stranded DNA virus, has been investigated in acute liver 
      disease, comprising 36 patients with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) and 25 with 
      fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), including 50 volunteer blood donors as controls. 
      METHODS: Detection of TTV DNA sequences was carried out by polymerase chain reaction 
      (PCR) using primers derived from the UTR(A) region of the TTV genome. The clinical 
      course and biochemical profile when infected with TTV alone or coinfected with other 
      classical hepatotropic viruses were analyzed. All patients were first evaluated for 
      liver function profile and for the presence of various hepatotropic viruses using 
      serological tests and PCR in serologically negative patients. RESULTS: 
      Transfusion-transmitted virus DNA was detected in 80.6% (29/36) of the AVH cases and 
      in 76% (19/25) of the FHF cases, which were significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) 
      than the 52% (26/50) observed in volunteer blood donors. No significant difference 
      in symptoms, clinical course, liver function and risk factor profile between 
      TTV-positive and TTV-negative patients could be observed in both AVH and FHF 
      patients. TTV was found to coexist with both parenterally and non-parenterally 
      transmitted hepatotropic viruses in similar frequency in both AVH and FHF patients. 
      Further, there was no significant difference in the mortality rates between 
      TTV-positive and TTV-negative FHF patients. Also, there was no difference between 
      patients coinfected by TTV and other hepatotropic viruses and those with TTV 
      infection alone. CONCLUSION: Thus, it appears that TTV, although it exists in a very 
      high frequency in the Indian population, appears to have no significant etiological 
      role in AVH and FHF.

TI  - Clinical significance of SEN-virus on interferon response in chronic hepatitis C 
      patients.
PG  - 1144-9
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: A novel virus, SEN-virus (SENV), was recently discovered. It has 
      been reported as a candidate for a non-A-E hepatitis virus. However, much is still 
      unknown about the clinical significance of SENV. The aim of the present study was to 
      clarify the clinical significance of SENV in patients coinfected with SENV and 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: The 52 subjects had chronic hepatitis C and had 
      undergone interferon (IFN) therapy. SEN virus DNA was investigated by using 
      polymerase chain reaction with SENV-specific primers, which we designed to detect 
      all strains of SENV. Additionally, SENV-D and -H were detected by consensus primers. 
      RESULTS: Thirty-five patients were SENV-DNA positive and 22 patients were SENV-D- or 
      -H-positive before IFN therapy. After IFN therapy, in the HCV-RNA eradication group, 
      all cases normalized their serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). However, in the no 
      eradication group, the ALT no-response rate was 68.7%. In contrast, in the SENV 
      eradication group, the ALT no-response rate was 51.9%, and in the no eradication 
      group, it was 37.5%. Also, in the SENV-D and -H eradication group, the ALT 
      no-response rate was 54.5%, and in the no eradication group, it was 36.4%. The 
      changes in ALT after IFN therapy were significantly correlated with the changes in 
      HCV RNA, but no correlation was found with the SENV DNA presence. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Hepatocellular injury in patients with chronic hepatitis who are coinfected with HCV 
      and SENV appears to primarily be caused by HCV, and is less attributable to SENV.

TI  - Clinical, histologic and serologic evaluation of patients with acute non-A-E 
      hepatitis in north-eastern Brazil: is it an infectious disease?
PG  - 222-30
AB  - Non-A-E hepatitis and acute cryptogenic hepatitis are the names given to the disease 
      of patients with clinical hepatitis, but in whom serologic evidence of A-E hepatitis 
      has not been found. Over a period of 8 years, we evaluated in Brazil 32 patients who 
      fulfilled the criteria for this diagnosis in order to determine patterns of the 
      clinical illness, laboratory parameters, or histologic features. Each patient was 
      subjected to virologic tests to exclude A-E hepatitis and 
      cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection. Drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune 
      disease were also excluded. Wilson's disease was excluded in young patients. The 
      course of the disease was clinical/biochemical recovery in 3 months in 25 patients 
      and persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation in 7 patients. Three of 
      these had chronic hepatitis, and one had severe fibrosis on liver biopsy. During the 
      acute illness, mean peak ALT was 1267 IU/L, bilirubin was 4.0 mg/dL, and ferritin 
      was 1393 IU/mL. GB virus type C (GBV-C) was found in six patients, and TT virus 
      (TTV) in five patients. We conclude that, in Brazil, non-A-E hepatitis probably 
      originates from still unidentified viruses. The course of the disease and the 
      histologic patterns are similar to those recorded for known viruses. Continuous 
      survey for the specific etiologic agents is needed.

TI  - TT virus infection during childhood.
PG  - 892-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) is widespread in the general population, however, the 
      mode of its transmission and the mechanism of maintaining it in the general 
      population are unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine the possible 
      mother-to-infant route of transmission, 54 infants bom to 50 anti-HCV-positive 
      mothers were assessed longitudinally. Nucleotide sequences amplified by seminested 
      PCR with primers targeting the N22 variable coding region of genotypes 1 through 6 
      were compared in mothers and their infants. RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV DNA was 
      30 percent (15/50; 95% CI, 18-45) in mothers and 44 percent (24/54; 95% CI, 31-59) 
      in their infants. TTV DNA was detected during a follow-up period in 13 (87%; 95% CI, 
      60-98) of 15 infants born to infected mothers and in 11 (28%; 95% CI, 15-45) of 39 
      infants bom to DNA-negative mothers. None of 38 cord blood samples, but one of 14 
      blood samples, obtained at 1 month of age had detectable TTV DNA. The lowest 
      infection rate at the earliest ages and the subsequent increasing prevalence of 
      infection (22% at 6 months and 33% [43% cumulative rate] at 2 years) is consistent 
      with an age-dependent acquisition of TTV by nonparenteral routes. In 
      13-mother-infant pairs positive for TTV DNA, six showed a high degree of nucleotide 
      sequence similarity (99.1-100%), whereas the remaining seven pairs differed more 
      than 10 percent from each other (46.8-89.2%). The viral load of matemal blood was 
      not a plausible risk factor for transmission. Genotype 1, of which pathogenicity 
      failed to be shown by measurement of hepatic enzymes, was more rapidly cleared (88 
      vs. 8% other genotypes, p < 0.001) among infants. CONCLUSIONS: These observations 
      strongly suggest that the main factor for TTV acquisition in children involves their 
      age-associated increase in environmental interactions with infectious materials. 
      Genotype 1 might be involved in a weak or a limited pathologic role, which can 
      possibly be diluted by other harmless genotypes.

TI  - Genetic variation of TNF-α and IL-10, IL-12, IL-17 genes and association with torque 
      teno virus infection post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
PG  - 186-194
LID - 10.4149/av_2019_210 [doi]
AB  - Little is known about the role of genetic variation in the genes for cytokines and 
      susceptibility to viral infection especially torque teno virus (TTV) following 
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this study, the association 
      between interleukin-12, interleukin-17, interleukin-10 (IL-12,-17,-10) and tumor 
      necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) polymorphisms was evaluated in patients with TTV infection 
      who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from South of Iran. 
      The single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytokine genes including IL-12 
      (-1188A/C), IL-17 (-197G/A), IL-10 (-1082G/A, -819C/T and -592C/A) and TNF-α (-308 
      G/A) were analyzed by PCR-RFLP methods. While our results did not show any 
      association between IL-17, IL-12 and IL-10 (-819C/T and -1082G/A) polymorphisms and 
      TTV infection status, heterozygote genotype of IL-10 (-592C/A) had direct 
      correlation with TTV infection and A allele of TNF-α (-308G/A) showed a protective 
      effect against TTV infection (P = 0.05 and P = 0.025, respectively). Within the 
      group of patients who experienced acute graft-versus-host disease, the AA genotype 
      and the A allele of IL-17 (-197 G/A) were significantly higher in non-infected 
      patients compared to infected ones (P = 0.024 and P = 0.057, respectively). It was 
      also observed that among infected patients, the GG genotype of IL-17 and AA genotype 
      of TNF-α were significantly increased in hematopoietic stem cell transplanted 
      patients with low grade (grade I+II) acute graft-versus-host disease compared to 
      high grade (grade III and IV) disease (P = 0.056 and P = 0.056, respectively). Taken 
      together, genetic variation of IL-10 (-592C/A) and TNF-α (-308G/A) genes might be 
      associated with susceptibility to TTV infection post hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation. Keywords: TNF-α; interleukins; torque teno virus (TTV); 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT); graft versus host disease (GvHD).

TI  - TT virus infection in acute and chronic liver diseases and in patients regularly 
      receiving blood products in Belgium.
PG  - 161-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: TT viruses are single-stranded DNA viruses, suggested to be involved in 
      non A-E hepatitis. We studied the prevalence of TTV infection in acute or chronic 
      hepatitis in Belgium in comparison with that in blood donors and in patients 
      regularly receiving blood products. METHODS: TTV-DNA was detected by PCR using the 
      primer set of Takahashi et al (1998) or a nested-PCR specific for genotype-2, 
      because it had been reported that this subtype might be more pathogenic (Tagger et 
      al. 1999). RESULTS: TTV-DNA was present in 49% of 128 patients with chronic 
      hepatitis C, in 54% of 54 with chronic hepatitis B and in 54% of 24 with acute liver 
      failure. This prevalence is similar to the 47% in 127 patients with clotting 
      disorders, or the 64% in 103 undergoing chronic haemodialysis, but lower than the 
      29.7% found in 340 healthy blood donors. Significant differences in clinical or 
      biochemical characteristics between TTV- positive or TTV-negative patients could not 
      be substantiated. The genotype-2 subgroup comprised 3.9%, but they also did not 
      differ from non genotype-2 patients. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of TTV infection 
      was higher in patients than in healthy blood donors. Its clinical significance 
      remains questionable since clinical and biochemical characteristics were not 
      different between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. The higher prevalence of 
      TTV in patients might be related to parenteral transmission, but the relatively high 
      prevalence in healthy blood donors points to an additional presumably faeco-oral 
      infection. The presence of TTV in animals suggests that infection might also 
      originate from food. Long term follow-up will have to define whether co-infection 
      with TTV eventually alters the natural history of chronic hepatitis.

TI  - GB virus C/hepatitis G virus and TT virus infections among high risk renal 
      transplant recipients in India.
PG  - 59-69
AB  - BACKGROUND: GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) and TT virus (TTV) have been 
      widely reported in patients with high parenteral risk such as haemodialysis and 
      renal transplant recipients. The occurrence of these agents in association with 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), in Indian renal transplant 
      recipients, is yet unreported. STUDY DESIGN: Molecular and serological markers of 
      GBV-C/HGV and TTV were examined in addition to those for HBV, HCV and hepatitis D 
      virus (HDV) in a selected group of seventy renal transplant recipients. HGV RNA 
      detection was achieved using primers specific for the 5'NCR and NS5a regions of the 
      genome. Anti-GBV-C/HGV antibody was detected using the mu plate anti-HG env kit 
      (Roche, Germany). TTV DNA PCR was performed using primers specific for the coding 
      region (method A) of the genome. In 50% of patients, TTV DNA was also tested for 
      using primers specific for the non-coding region (method B). Host related factors 
      such as age, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, number of transfusions, 
      haemodialysis sessions, and months following transplantation were also studied. 
      RESULTS: Exposure rates to GBV-C/HGV, TTV (method A), HBV, HCV and HDV were 58.6, 
      32.9, 52.9, 54.3 and 2.9%, respectively. 'Active' infection as measured by viraemia 
      and/or virus-specific antigenaemia for GBV-C/HGV, TTV, HBV and HCV was 52.9, 32.9, 
      15.7 and 52.9%, respectively. The majority of GBV-C/HGV and TTV infections were seen 
      as co-infections with other hepatitis viruses. Single infection with GBV-C/HGV and 
      TTV was seen in ten (14.2%) and eight (11.4%) patients, and was not associated with 
      ALT elevation when compared to uninfected blood donors. Using univariate analysis, 
      GBV-C/HGV RNA was significantly associated with > or =20 haemodialysis sessions. TTV 
      DNA occurrence was not associated with any risk factors. CONCLUSIONS: There is a 
      high occurrence of GBV-C/HGV and TTV in this select group of renal transplant 
      recipients in India. These viruses mostly occurred in the context of co-infections 
      with other hepatitis viruses. Long term effects of multiple hepatotropic viral 
      infections need to be carefully documented in such transplant populations.

TI  - Presence and significance of TT virus in Danish patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis.
PG  - 259-64
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) in a population of Danish 
      hemodialysis patients and evaluate possible relations between TTV infection and 
      elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and hypo-response to treatment with 
      erythropoietin (EPO). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis at 
      a single center were invited to participate. Demographic and clinical data were 
      registered. Blood samples for virological and routine biochemical tests were drawn 
      simultaneously. TTV DNA was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV 
      viral load was estimated by means of semi-quantitative PCR. All patients were tested 
      for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and GB virus C. RESULTS: Of 252 patients, 204 (80.9%) 
      gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. The prevalence of 
      TTV was 68% and 50% of TTV-positive patients had a high TTV viral load. TTV-positive 
      patients were significantly older than TTV-negative patients (p = 0.011). No 
      relations were found between TTV infection and elevated levels of alanine 
      aminotransferase (ALT) or CRP or hypo-response to EPO treatment. The mean hemoglobin 
      concentration was 11.24 +/- 1.48 g/dl. Patients with a high TTV viral load had a 
      lower level of hemoglobin (10.86 +/- 1.47 g/dl) than the others (p = 0.01). This 
      trend suggested a positive relation between TTV infection and the number of blood 
      transfusions. A restriction fragment length polymorphism assay suggested that 
      patients were infected with different TTV strains. CONCLUSIONS: TTV is common in 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis. The presence of TTV is associated with 
      increasing age. Patients with a high TTV viral load had lower levels of hemoglobin 
      than the others. TTV infection is not related to elevated levels of ALT or CRP or to 
      hypo-response to EPO treatment.

      supplementation to improve the immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplant (HSCT). PATIENTS AND METHODS: We enrolled 18 patients undergoing 
      autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma. Nine patients were randomized to receive only 
      a standard antimicrobial prophylaxis; whereas, nine patients received in addition 
      150 mg/day of zinc from day +5 to day +100 after transplant. RESULTS: CD4+ naïve 
      lymphocytes and TRECs showed a significant increase from day +30 until day +100 only 
      in the zinc-treated group. Moreover, the load of Torquetenovirus, a harmless virus 
      that replicates in course of immunedepression, increased at day +100 only in the 
      control group. No severe adverse events were reported during the zinc consumption. 
      CONCLUSION: First data from the ZENITH trial suggest that high-dose zinc 
      supplementation is safe and may enhance the thymic reconstitution after HSCT.

PG  - 1068-70
AB  - A 17-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of severe acute hepatitis. 
      Serologic studies were negative for A, B, C and G hepatitis viruses. Later, he was 
      found to be positive for transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) DNA. He was discharged 
      after normalization of liver function tests. Four months after the onset of 
      hepatitis, he was re-admitted because of pancytopenia. Bone marrow findings were 
      consistent with aplastic anemia. The anemia responded to steroid therapy. In this 
      case, TTV was probably involved in the development of aplastic anemia.

TI  - TT virus infection in patients on peritoneal dialysis in Taiwan.
PG  - 553-7
AB  - Many studies have reported the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) 
      infection in hemodialysis patients, but few reports studied the prevalence of TTV 
      infection in peritoneal dialysis patients. In this study, we determined the 
      prevalence of TTV in a peritoneal dialysis population in Taiwan and related its 
      prevalence with history of blood transfusion, serum hepatitis B surface antigen 
      (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and serum aminotransferases (AST 
      and ALT) levels. Serum samples from 47 peritoneal dialysis patients and a control 
      group of 43 patients at health examination were studied for TTV viremia by using 
      polymerase chain reaction. The rate of blood transfusion exposure (p < 0.0001), 
      female gender (p = 0.001), younger age (p = 0.0014), and serum AST level (p = 0.012) 
      were significantly higher in peritoneal dialysis patients. The prevalence of TTV 
      viremia was not significantly different between peritoneal dialysis patients and the 
      control group (23.4% vs. 37.2%). TTV infection was not associated with evident liver 
      diseases in peritoneal dialysis patients, and the infection rate was not different 
      between automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal 
      dialysis (CAPD) patients. There was no statistically significant association between 
      TTV infection and age, gender, transfusion history, duration of peritoneal dialysis, 
      AST level, ALT level, HBsAg, or anti-HCV seropositivity in peritoneal dialysis 
      patients. Our results suggest that TTV infection is not associated with evident 
      liver diseases, and there is no difference between TTV infection in healthy 
      individuals and peritoneal dialysis patients. TTV transmission probably occurs via 
      routes unrelated to peritoneal dialysis.

TI  - Transfusion-transmitted virus infection in hemodialysis patients in Arar, Saudi 
      Arabia: Prevalence, predictors and genotyping.
PG  - 1215-22
LID - 10.4103/1319-2442.168643 [doi]
AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that was 
      identified in patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of non-A-to-G type. Patients 
      with chronic renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have a higher risk of 
      viral infections, and the prevalence of TTV infection is common. The aim of our 
      study was to detect TTV-DNA and its genotype in HD patients. A case-control study 
      compromising of 63 patients on maintenance HD therapy at the Nephrology Center of 
      Central Arar Hospital and 100 healthy individuals who were tested for TTVDNA and its 
      genotype by semi nested-polymerase chain reaction with primers derived from the 
      conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region followed by digestion with NdeI and 
      PstI restriction enzyme. The results show that the prevalence of TTV in HD patients 
      was high and statistically significant; 42.9% compared with 19% in the control 
      group. History of blood transfusion was the only significant predictor, and we found 
      that age of patients, duration of HD, hepatitis B and C infection, aspartate 
      aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were not significant predictors 
      of TT virus positivity in HD patients. TTV genotype 1 (G1) was found to be the most 
      common genotype among both HD and healthy controls. The prevalence of TTV among HD 
      patients was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals. History of blood 
      transfusion was the only significant predictor of TTV positivity among them. 
      Genotype 1 was the most predominant type among HD and healthy individuals. Further 
      studies on TTV in peritoneal dialysis patients and transplant patients are needed.

TI  - High frequency of SEN virus infection in thalassemic patients and healthy blood 
      donors in Iran.
PG  - 1
LID - 10.1186/1743-422X-7-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: SEN virus is a blood-borne, circular ssDNA virus and possessing nine 
      genotypes (A to I). Among nine genotypes, SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes have the 
      strong link with patients with unknown (none-A to E) hepatitis infections. Infection 
      with blood-borne viruses is the second important cause of death in thalassemic 
      patients. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of SENV-D and SENV-H 
      genotypes viremia by performing nested-PCR in 120 and 100 sera from healthy blood 
      donors and thalassemic patients in Guilan Province, North of Iran respectively. 
      Also, to explicate a possible role of SEN virus in liver disease and established 
      changes in blood factors, the serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and some of the 
      blood factors were measured. RESULTS: Frequency of SENV-D, SENV (SENV-H or SENV-D) 
      and co-infection (both SENV-D and SENV-H) viremia was significantly higher among 
      thalassemic patients than healthy individuals. Frequency of SENV-H viremia was 
      significantly higher than SENV-D among healthy individuals. In comparison to SENV-D 
      negative patients, the mean of mean corpuscular hemoglobin was significantly higher 
      in SENV-D positive and co-infection cases (P < 0.05). The means of AST and ALT were 
      significantly higher in thalassemic patients than healthy blood donors, but there 
      were not any significant differences in the means of the liver levels between 
      SENV-positive and -negative individuals in healthy blood donors and thalassemic 
      patients. High nucleotide homology observed among PCR amplicon's sequences in 
      healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of 
      co-infection shows that different genotypes of SENV have no negative effects on each 
      other. The high frequency of SENV infection among thalassemic patients suggests 
      blood transfusion as main route of transmission. High frequency of SENV infection in 
      healthy individuals indicates that other routes rather than blood transfusion also 
      are important. Frequency of 90.8% of SENV infection among healthy blood donors as 
      well as high nucleotide homology of sequenced amplicons between two groups can 
      probably suggest that healthy blood donors infected by SENV act partly as a source 
      of SENV transmission to the thalassemic patients. In conclusion, SENV-D isolate in 
      Guilan Province may be having a pathogenic agent for thalassemic patients.

PG  - 526-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To report a retrospective analysis on the presence of hepatitis B virus 
      (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) sequences in 
      formalin fixed, paraffin embedded liver biopsies from eight patients with 
      hepatocellular carcinoma, in comparison with blood markers. METHODS: A direct in 
      situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was developed for the detection and 
      localisation of genomic signals in the liver tissue. Conventional serological and 
      molecular methods were used for blood evaluation. RESULTS: In situ PCR showed the 
      presence of one of the three viruses (four HCV, two HBV, and one TTV) in seven of 
      the eight patients. In addition, a co-infection with HBV and HCV was detected in one 
      patient. HCV and HBV sequences were located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, 
      respectively. When compared with blood markers, these findings were compatible with 
      one occult HBV and two occult HCV infections. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide 
      further evidence for occult HBV and HCV infections in cancerous tissues from 
      patients with hepatocellular carcinomas. In situ PCR could be an additional tool for 
      evaluating the viral aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma alongside conventional 
      diagnostic procedures.

TI  - GB virus C and TT virus infections in Japanese patients with autoimmune hepatitis.
PG  - 258-62
AB  - The association of the newly identified viruses, GB virus C (GBV-C) and TT virus 
      (TTV), with autoimmune hepatitis remains to be elucidated. Sera from 20 Japanese 
      patients with autoimmune hepatitis and 50 volunteer blood donors were assayed for 
      GBV-C RNA, antibodies to the GBV-C second envelope protein (E2), and TTV DNA. GBV-C 
      RNA was examined by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). 
      Anti-GBV-C E2 (a marker of past infection) was tested by an enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. TTV DNA was amplified by PCR using two different sets of 
      primers: one derived from the original N22 sequence (Set A) and the other from the 
      untranslated region (Set B). None of the patients or controls had GBV-C RNA. 
      Anti-GBV-C E2 was found significantly more often in patients with autoimmune 
      hepatitis (3/20) than in controls (1/50; P = 0.034). The prevalence of TTV DNA 
      detected by primers Set A and that detected with either Set A or B were similar 
      among patients with autoimmune hepatitis (4/20 and 16/20, respectively) and controls 
      (9/50 and 40/50, respectively). Clinical characteristics did not differ in 
      association with any of these viral markers. Of the 13 TTV isolates amplified with 
      Set A, seven were classified as genotype 1a, four as genotype 1b, and 2 as genotype 
      3; no particular strain was associated with autoimmune hepatitis. These findings 
      provide no compelling evidence that GBV-C or TTV has a pathogenic role in autoimmune 
      hepatitis.

AB  - The pathogenic role of torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in swine is controversial among 
      different studies. The present study intended to evaluate the potential 
      pathogenicity of TTSuV based on its correlations with the histopathological changes, 
      various common concurrently infected viral pathogens including porcine circovirus 
      type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and 
      porcine parvovirus (PPV), as well as changes in the distribution and population of 
      host immunocytes such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages by using the 
      superficial inguinal lymph nodes (siLNs) of wasting pigs. A tissue microarray 
      consisting of 270 available siLNs collected from 262 clinically wasting and 8 
      healthy pigs, respectively, were used for the detection of TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PCV2, 
      PRRSV, and PPV by either in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemical (IHC) 
      staining, and for the detection of various subsets of immunocytes by IHC staining 
      with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79a, and lysozyme. The slides were then subject 
      to digital scanning followed by a semi-quantitative positive pixel evaluation for 
      further statistical analysis. Although a high prevalence of TTSuV1 and/or TTSuV2 
      infection was noted in both wasting and healthy pigs, the wasting pigs had a 
      significantly higher intensity in both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 ISH-positive signals than 
      healthy ones did. In the wasting pigs, a significant positive correlation in the 
      tissue viral load was noted between TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 and between TTSuV2 and PCV2, 
      but not between TTSuV1 and PCV2. Conversely, a significant negative correlation in 
      the tissue viral load was revealed between TTSuV2, but not TTSuV1, and PRRSV. The 
      tissue viral load of TTSuV1 was significantly correlated with B cell hyperplasia, 
      while the tissue viral load of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated with increased 
      macrophage population. The ISH positivity of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated 
      with lymphoid depletion and granulomatous inflammation, which are the characteristic 
      histopathological findings in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected 
      pigs. These findings suggest that both TTSuV species may have the potential 
      involving the development of porcine circovirus-associated lymphoid lesions via 
      alternating the host immune system.

TI  - SEN and hepatitis virus infections in nontransfused children and pediatric 
      thalassemia patients with multiple transfusions in Taiwan.
PG  - 208-14
AB  - BACKGROUND: Southern Taiwan is a hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) endemic area. 
      SEN virus (SENV) infection has been suggested as transfusion-related hepatitis. Two 
      variants of SENV (SENV-D and SENV-H) have been studied in non-transfused children 
      and transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. METHODS: Sera of 67 non-transfused 
      children and 55 pediatric thalassemia patients with multiple transfusions were 
      tested for SENV-D and SENV-H DNAs, liver function, iron status, HBV and HCV markers. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of SENV (D or H), SENV-D, SENV-H infection, and SENV-D/H 
      coinfection was significantly lower in nontransfused children than in thalassemia 
      patients (22.4, 20.9, 5.0 and 1.5%, respectively, versus 67.3, 52.7, 40.0 and 25.5%, 
      respectively, p < 0.001). The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in 
      thalassemia patients with SENV infection alone were significantly lower than levels 
      in patients with SENV/HCV co-infection (p < 0.05), but not different when compared 
      with those without SENV/HCV infection. SENV viremia was not associated with elevated 
      ALT levels in thalassemia patients. SENV viremia did not increase the risk of HCV 
      infection in thalassemia patients. CONCLUSIONS: SENV infection is high among 
      non-transfused controls in Taiwan. Transfusion significantly increases the relevance 
      of SENV infection. SENV viremia was not associated with the ALT levels in 
      thalassemia patients.

TI  - Viral infection in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.
PG  - 1698-702
LID - 10.1164/rccm.201010-1752OC [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, uniformly fatal 
      interstitial lung disease. An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is 
      an episode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult 
      viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. 
      OBJECTIVES: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of 
      viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. METHODS: 
      Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic 
      pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral 
      nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and 
      high-throughput cDNA sequencing. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Four of forty-three 
      patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of 
      common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], 
      coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from 
      stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral 
      infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno 
      virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was 
      significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls 
      (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. 
      Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of 
      TTV but did not identify additional viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Viral infection was not 
      detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV 
      was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the 
      clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.

TI  - Infectious hepatitis C, hepatitis G, and TT virus: review and implications for 
      dentists.
PG  - 53-8
AB  - In the past 10 years, hepatitis C and G viruses have been identified, and in the 
      last two years a further parenterally transmitted agent, termed TT virus (TTV), has 
      been discovered. These viruses have a worldwide distribution and frequently cause 
      chronic infection. The purpose of this article was to promote an understanding of 
      these viral agents and their relevance in dental practice. Infected patients may 
      develop a chronic carrier state without clinical disease or may develop liver 
      disease, and may have related oral conditions. Dental providers will see a growing 
      number of patients with HCV/HGV and possibly TTV infection. All of these patients 
      require appropriate infection control measures during dental treatment.

TI  - Clinical impact of genotype 1 TT virus infection in patients with chronic hepatitis 
      C and response of TT virus to alpha-interferon.
PG  - 1292-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between genotype 1 TT virus (TTV) infection and the 
      status of chronic hepatitis C was studied. METHODS: A total of 52 patients with 
      chronic hepatitis C who were treated with interferon (IFN)-alpha were enrolled in 
      the present study. Of those, 12 were infected with genotype 1 TTV and 40 were 
      uninfected. RESULTS: Clinical backgrounds, including mean age, sex, blood 
      transfusion history, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the results of 
      liver biopsy did not differ between patients with and without genotype 1 TTV 
      infection. The distribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes did not differ 
      between the two groups of patients, but TTV-infected patients tended to have a lower 
      serum HCV-RNA level than uninfected patients (median (range) 26.0 (< 1-460) vs 135 
      (1.2-740) kilo copies/mL, respectively; P = 0.065). Patients with a sustained 
      response of HCV to IFN-alpha were significantly more common in TTV-infected than 
      -uninfected patients (58 vs 23%, respectively; P = 0.018). Multivariate logistic 
      regression analysis revealed that patients with a sustained response of HCV 
      correlated significantly with the serum HCV-RNA level (P = 0.006), but not with the 
      presence or absence of genotype 1 TTV infection (P = 0.161). Serum TTV-DNA decreased 
      with IFN-alpha therapy in all 12 patients and remained negative in six patients even 
      after treatment. There was no correlation between patients with a sustained response 
      of HCV and the same of TTV. Serum ALT levels correlated with changes in the status 
      of HCV viremia, but not with changes in the status of TTV viremia. CONCLUSIONS: An 
      opposing relationship between HCV and TTV proliferation was suggested, but 
      coinfection with genotype 1 TTV did not affect the status of chronic hepatitis C.

TI  - [Study on infection of transfusion transmitted virus in serum, breast milk of 
      pregnant women and umbilical venous blood from their newborns].
PG  - 330-2
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection in pregnant women 
      and their newborns, and the route of transmission. METHODS: Serum, breast milk from 
      150 pregnant women and umbilical venous blood from their newborns were collected. 
      TTV DNA was amplified by semi-nested-polymerase chain reaction, and the positive 
      products were sequenced directly. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV DNA in pregnancy 
      serum was 11.3% (17/150). Among the 17 serum positive cases, TTV DNA was detected in 
      11 breast milk samples, and none in all the umbilical blood. The homologous of 
      partial nucleotide sequence of TTV DNA between the 3 serum samples and their breast 
      milk were 97.6%-99.2%. Compared the 5 serum positive samples (A1-A5) with N22 
      segments of Japanese original isolate, the homologous of partial nucleotide and 
      amino acid sequence were 71.5%-92.8%, 71.5%-92.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: There 
      exists TTV infection in pregnancy serum and breast milk. Transmission by breast 
      feeding may be one of the main pathway causing TTV infection.

PG  - 194-6
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To make clear the infection of TT virus(TTV) in patients of hemodialysis 
      and bone marrow-transplantation and to evaluate the virulence. METHODS: The TTV 
      infection were investigated in 37 cases of hemodialysis and 90 cases of bone 
      marrow-transplantation by means of review method. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV 
      was 16.22% (6/37) in 37 cases of hemodialysis and 3.33% (3/90) in 90 cases of bone 
      marrow-transplantation. The difference between them was significant(P < 0.01). Of 
      the six TTV-positive patients, 5 had blood transfusion and 4 of them had bone 
      marrow-transplantation. Infection of TTV had nothing to do with the infection of HBV 
      and HCV. There were no significant differences in the results of liver function 
      tests between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. CONCLUSION: These results 
      suggest that blood transfusion might be one of the critical routes to transmit TTV. 
      The virulence of TTV might be mild. Whether TTV is a hepatitis viral remains further 
      study.

TI  - Prevalence of TTV DNA and GBV-C RNA in patients with systemic sclerosis, rheumatoid 
      arthritis, and osteoarthritis does not differ from that in healthy blood donors.
PG  - 806-9
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of GB virus-C (GBV-C) RNA and TT virus (TTV) 
      DNA in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 
      osteoarthritis (OA) as well as to compare the autoantibody pattern in patients with 
      SSc with and without evidence of viral infection. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study 
      included 168 patients (84 SSc, 41 RA, and 43 OA) diagnosed according to the American 
      College of Rheumatology criteria and 122 volunteer blood donors. The presence of 
      GBV-C RNA and TTV DNA in serum was assessed by nested reverse 
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and semi-nested PCR, respectively. 
      Autoantibodies in patients with SSc were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent 
      assay (ELISA) and Hep-2 immunofluorescence. RESULTS: TTV-DNA was detected in 10/84 
      (12%) patients with SSc, 9/41 (22%) patients with RA, 3/43 (7%) patients with OA, 
      and 16/122 (13%) blood donors. GBV-C RNA was present in 4/84 (5%) patients with SSc, 
      2/43 (5%) patients with OA, and 5/122 (4%) blood donors. No patient with RA was 
      positive for GBV-C RNA. One patient with SSc and one patient with OA showed a double 
      infection with GBV-C and TTV. 74/84 (88%) patients with SSc were positive for at 
      least one autoantibody species tested: 18/84 (21%) showed anticentromeric 
      autoantibodies, 55/84 (66%) a speckled (36/84 (43%) fine, 19/84 (23%) coarse), and 
      20/84 (24%) a homogeneous nuclear Hep-2 pattern, and 21/84 (25%) had antinucleolar 
      autoantibodies. Anti-Scl-70 antibodies were found in 31/84 (37%) and anti-RNP 
      antibodies in 5/84 (6%) patients with SSc. No differences in the autoantibody 
      pattern in patients with SSc with or without viral infection could be detected. 
      CONCLUSION: The prevalence of GBV-C RNA and TTV DNA in serum samples from patients 
      with SSc, RA, and OA was low and comparable with that in blood donors. A continuing 
      infection with TTV and or GBV-C was not associated with a significant change in the 
      autoantibody pattern in patients with SSc. These data provide no evidence for an 
      association between GBV-C and/or TTV infections and SSc and/or arthritis (RA and 
      OA).

TI  - Frequent detection of the replicative form of TT virus DNA in peripheral blood 
      mononuclear cells and bone marrow cells in cancer patients.
PG  - 428-34
AB  - The TT virus (TTV), a member of a family of human viruses related to the 
      circoviridae viruses, was associated initially with acute and chronic liver 
      diseases. TTV consists of a single-stranded, circular DNA genome of 3.8 kilobases 
      (kb) and at least three open reading frames (ORFs). The objective of the present 
      study was to determine whether or not TTV replicated in peripheral blood mononuclear 
      cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow cells (BMCs). DNA was extracted from the PBMCs or BMCs 
      of 153 cancer patients and from the PBMCs of 50 healthy blood donors (the controls). 
      By using a single round of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TTV was detected in 
      98.6% (141 of 143) of the PBMCs and in 90% (9 of 10) of the BMCs from cancer 
      patients. TTV DNA was detected in significantly fewer control subjects at 86% (43 of 
      50; P < 0.05). Strand-specific PCR (SSPCR) targeting the ORF2 of the common 
      genotypes of TTV was developed specifically to detect TTV positive or negative 
      strand DNA and to examine TTV replication. TTV positive strand DNA, which may be an 
      intermediate of viral replication, was detected in 55.3% (78 of 141) of the 
      TTV-infected PBMCs of the cancer patients and in 7% (3 of 43) of the controls (P < 
      0.001). The replicative form of TTV was also detectable in 55.6% (5 of 9) of the 
      TTV-infected BMCs. The existence of double-strand (positive and negative strands) 
      TTV DNA in PBMCs and BMCs of the cancer patients was also supported by the finding 
      that TTV DNA extracted from these cells was resistant to S1 nuclease. Using in situ 
      hybridization, TTV DNA was also demonstrated to be present in the nucleus of PBMCs. 
      It is concluded that replicative intermediate forms of TTV DNA are present in both 
      PBMCs and BMCs, indicating that blood cells may be a site of TTV replication.

TI  - [Detection of transfusion transmitted virus infection and genotypes in pregnant 
      women].
PG  - 325-7
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the frequency, the routes of transmission from mother to 
      infant, the correlation factors and distribution of genotypes of transfusion 
      transmitted virus (TTV) infection. METHODS: Nested-polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) 
      was performed to detect TTV DNA and genotypes in serums and breast milks from 160 
      cases of pregnant women. RESULTS: TTV DNA in serum and breast milk was detected in 
      64 (40.0%) and 60 (37.5%) of 160 cases of pregnant women respectively. The positive 
      rates of TTV DNA from HBV markers (+) and normal groups were 50.0%, 43.1% and 13.6%, 
      22.7% respectively in serums and breast milk. There were significant difference 
      between the two groups (P < 0.05). The TTV genotypes were type I in all 124 samples 
      of TTV DNA detected. CONCLUSIONS: TTV infection is common in the pregnant women and 
      a high prevalence of TTV infection in pregnant women with positive HBV markers has 
      been demonstrated. TTV infection is correlated with HBV. TTV is probably transmitted 
      from mother to their children by breast feeding. All of TTV genotypes detected in 
      pregnant women is genotype I.

TI  - New prevalence estimate of TT virus (TTV) infection in low- and high-risk population 
      from São Paulo, Brazil.
PG  - 233-4
AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection was investigated by Polymerase Chain 
      Reaction (PCR) in low- (blood donors and healthy children/adolescents) and high-risk 
      (hemophiliacs) groups from São Paulo, Brazil. Primers based on the untranslated 
      region (UTR) of the viral genome proved to be much more ubiquitous, leading to much 
      higher frequencies for both groups (>or= 81%) than the earlier N22-PCR directed to 
      the open reading frame 1 (blood donors, 5.5%, and hemophiliacs, 42.3%). The UTR-PCR 
      also revealed an interesting profile for healthy children/adolescents: very high 
      prevalence at the early years and significant decrease in male teenagers. The 
      N22-PCR, in turn, demonstrated higher frequency in hemophiliacs treated with fresh 
      blood products (58%), than in those treated with virus-inactivated clotting factors 
      (9.4%) and blood donors (5.5%).

TI  - Inverse relationship between the titre of TT virus DNA and the CD4 cell count in 
      patients infected with HIV.
PG  - 563-70
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the prevalence and relative titre of TT virus (TTV) DNA, 
      and to examine the relationship between the extent of TTV viraemia and the immune 
      status among 144 patients with HIV infection; 178 age- and sex-matched healthy 
      individuals were also studied. METHODS: TTV DNA was detected quantitatively by two 
      distinct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods [untranslated region (UTR) and 
      N22]. UTR PCR detects all TTV genotypes, and N22 PCR can primarily detect four major 
      TTV genotypes (1-4). RESULTS: Using UTR PCR and N22 PCR, respectively, TTV DNA was 
      detected significantly more frequently in HIV-infected patients than in controls (99 
      versus 91%, P < 0.001; 56 versus 27%, P < 0.0001), and the relative titre (10N/ml) 
      was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients [4.5 +/- 1.2 (mean +/- SD) versus 
      3.1 +/- 0.9, P < 0.0001; 2.6 +/- 1.5 versus 1.5 +/- 0.9, P < 0.0001]. Age, sex, 
      co-infection with hepatitis B or C virus, and risk factors for HIV transmission did 
      not appear to be significant factors associated with the titre of TTV viraemia. 
      However, the titre of TTV DNA was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients with 
      AIDS (P < 0.0001), those with low CD4 T cell count (P < 0.0001), or those with high 
      HIV viral loads (P = 0.0047). CONCLUSION: TTV is highly prevalent and high-titred in 
      HIV-infected patients. The TTV viral load may reflect the degree of immune status of 
      these immunocompromised hosts.

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) is a widespread anellovirus that establishes persistent 
      infections in human showing an increased viremia in immunosuppressed patients. TTV 
      possesses microRNA (miRNA)-coding sequences that might be involved in viral immune 
      evasion. Here, the presence of TTV DNA and miRNAs expression was investigated in 
      plasma samples of 77 diseased (20 infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 
      18 infected with hepatitis B (HBV) virus, 18 infected with hepatitis C (HCV) virus, 
      21 solid organ transplanted) patients, and 25 healthy controls. TTV prevalence was 
      significantly different in healthy controls (60%, 15/25) versus diseased patients 
      (80%, 62/77), showing the highest TTV loads in transplant recipients. Genetic TTV 
      analysis showed the highest prevalence of group 1, followed by groups 3, 4 and 5, 
      and a lack of isolates of group 2. The expression of at least one TTV miRNAs of 
      group 1, 3 and 5 was found in exosomes of plasma of the great majority of 
      individuals (96%, 98/102 subjects) showing the higher prevalence of miRNAs of TTV 
      group 3 (90%, 92/102), followed by miRNAs of group 1 (66%, 67/102), and miRNA of 
      group 5 (49%, 50/102). TTV miRNAs expression and TTV viremia were not always 
      directly correlated, and significant differences appeared in production of some TTV 
      miRNAs between healthy controls and diseased patients. The reported TTV miRNAs 
      status in exosomes encourages further investigation to understand their potential 
      role in the expansion of anelloviruses upon immunosuppression.

TI  - Successful combined antifungal salvage therapy with liposomal amphothericin B and

      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.
PG  - 17-21
AB  - The emergence of new antifungal compounds with alternative mechanisms of action and 
      improved tolerability has opened up new therapeutic possibilities for the use of 
      combined antifungal treatment in life-threatening systemic fungal infections. A case 
      report of an 8-year-old allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient who developed a 
      central venous catheter tunnel infection caused by Aspergillus flavus is presented 
      here. In spite of conventional and subsequent liposomal amphotericin B therapy the 
      infection progressed rapidly and the necrosis extended further to the thoracic wall, 
      pleura and the right lung. Combined treatment consisting of liposomal amphotericin B 
      and caspofungin was instituted. After 30 days of dual therapy the deep fungal 
      infection resolved and the extensive soft tissue defect showed scarring. One year 
      post-transplant, the patient is well, with normal bone marrow function and full 
      donor chimerism. Although there is limited clinical data on the effectiveness of 
      echinocandins in pediatric patients with documented invasive fungal infections, this 
      case report shows that combining liposomal amphotericin B with caspofungin could be 
      advantageous.

TI  - Co-infections with hepatitis G and TT virus in patients with chronic hepatitis C in 
      Hungary.
PG  - 437-47
AB  - The significance of co-infections with novel hepatitis viruses Hepatitis G (GBV-C, 
      HGV) and TT virus (TTV) in chronic hepatitis C is not clear. We determined the 
      prevalence of HGV RNA and TTV DNA in chronic hepatitis C patients and in 
      asymptomatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers, and assessed the influence of these 
      agents on the course of HCV infection. Seventy-seven patients with chronic hepatitis 
      C--50 of them treated with interferon (IFN)--and 33 HCV carriers with normal alanine 
      aminotransferase have been investigated. Previous HBV infection was detected by 
      testing serum HBsAg and aHBc. HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected by PCR. In the 
      healthy population, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 0.3%, HGV RNA 8.0% and TTV DNA 
      18.5%. In chronic hepatitis C HGV RNA occurred in 9.09% and TTV DNA in 40.25% of 
      cases. In IFN-treated patients with sustained remission, the frequency of TTV was 
      20% vs. 45.7% found in non-responders. Among asymptomatic HCV-carriers, the 
      prevalence of HGV RNA was 9.09% and TTV DNA 75.7%. Neither HGV RNA nor TTV DNA had 
      apparent effect on the HCV infection. TTV was detected with the lowest frequency in 
      persons with sustained remission due to IFN, suggesting antiviral effect of IFN on 
      TTV.

TI  - Prevalence and clinical significance of SEN-H virus in chronic hepatitis B, C and 
      delta infections in Turkey.
PG  - 104-8
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: SEN viruses are transmitted parenterally and can cause 
      post-transfusion hepatitis. The prevalence and clinical significance of SEN viruses 
      have been investigated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and B but not in D. We 
      aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of SEN viruses- H in 
      patients with chronic hepatitis C, B and delta in Turkey. METHODS: SEN viruses-H was 
      analyzed in 85 patients with chronic viral hepatitis (30 HCV, 30 HBV and 25 HDV) and 
      43 non-professional blood donors. HBV DNA, HCV RNA and HDV RNA were positive in 
      patients with hepatitis B, C and D, respectively. SEN viruses-H DNA was detected by 
      semi-nested polymerase chain reaction method (L2AS, C5S primer in first step, L2AS, 
      D11 in second step) after extraction of DNA from sera (NucleoSpin blood; 
      Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co KG, Germany). RESULTS: SEN viruses-H DNA was found to be 
      positive in 7/30 (23.3%), 10/30 (33.3%), 6/25 (24%), and 7/43 (16.2%) of patients 
      with chronic C, B, and D hepatitis and healthy blood donors, respectively. There was 
      no significant difference in clinical features and treatment response between SEN 
      viruses- H-positive and -negative patients with chronic viral hepatitis. 
      CONCLUSIONS: SEN viruses is more frequent in chronic hepatitis patients than in 
      healthy blood donors. These results indicate that SEN viruses has no effect on the 
      clinical course and treatment response of chronic viral hepatitis.

TI  - Prevalence of TT virus infection in Italian dialysis patients.
PG  - 97-100
LID - 10.1016/j.patbio.2008.07.014 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A novel DNA virus, transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is identified from 
      the serum of a patient from acute hepatitis non-A-E. Few reports have been published 
      on patients with renal disease. Patients on dialysis were at high risk of 
      blood-borne viral infections and little is known about the prevalence of this virus 
      in dialysis patients. In order to verify the prevalence of infection from TTV in 
      these patients, we have examined the incidence of TTV in Italian patients with 
      dialysis. METHODS: Serum samples of 85 patients and 65 healthy individuals were 
      examined. In order to evidence the presence of the TTV virus, a method of the 
      seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TTV-specific primers derives from 
      the N22 region deIl'ORF-1 of the virus has been used and products were analyzed by 
      agarose-gel electrophoresis. All serum samples were also analyzed to markers HBV and 
      HCV. RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV DNA in dialysis patients [35/85 (41.7%)] was 
      significantly higher than in healthy population [7/65 (10.7%)]. Among TTV positive 
      dialysis patients, HCV coinfection was present in six cases. The positivity rate for 
      TTV-DNA tends to increase with age. CONCLUSION: Transfusion-transmitted virus had a 
      high prevalence in Italian-dialysis patients. In our study the virus did not have an 
      important clinical effect on patients; but remains the possibility that it may 
      aggravate liver disease caused by HCV. However, the question of whether TTV 
      infection might have a possible effect on dialysis patients requires further 
      investigation in larger groups.

PG  - 41-5
AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, clinical impact and importance of 
      different risk factors of transmission of TTV infection in Slovakia using two PCR 
      methods. Sera of 426 adult persons were examined. TTV DNA was identified by PCR 
      using primers from N22 and untranslated region (UTR) respectively. The established 
      prevalence of TTV tested with N22 and UTR primers according to patients groups was: 
      acute hepatitis of unknown etiology 4 resp. 28 of 37, acute hepatitis B 3 resp. 29 
      of 38, chronic hepatitis B 11 resp. 41 of 44, chronic hepatitis C 10 resp. 93 of 
      102, hemodialysis patients 13 resp. 72 of 72, health care workers 0 resp. 27 of 33, 
      control group 8 resp. 83 of 100. Using N22 primers, TTV infection occurred more 
      frequently in chronic hepatitis B group compared with health care workers, if UTR 
      primers were used the group of hemodialysis patients differed significantly from 
      both acute hepatitis groups, health care workers and controls (p < 0.05). From 
      possible risk factors hemodialysis and transfusion count showed notable differences. 
      Bilirubin and aminotransferase levels did not differ between TTV positive and 
      negative groups. No pathogenetic role of TT virus in liver injury was confirmed.

TI  - Prevalence of TT virus in a CAPD population.
PG  - 341-3
AB  - TT virus (TTV) has recently been identified in patients with post-transfusion non-A, 
      non-G hepatitis. It is reported to be common in patients with a variety of liver 
      diseases and with history of transfusion. Its pathogenesis in chronic liver diseases 
      remains unclear. In this study, we have determined the prevalence of TTV in a 
      continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) population and related its 
      prevalence with history of previous hemodialysis, transfusion, HCV positivity and 
      serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT) levels. TTV was detected in 44% of 63 CAPD 
      patients and 30% of 43 healthy controls (p = 0.15). Frequency of TTV was similar in 
      previously hemodialysed and never hemodialysed (8/14, 57% vs. 20/40, 41%, p = 0.15) 
      and previously transfused and non-transfused (7/19, 37% vs. 15/44, 34%) CAPD 
      patients. Prevalence of TTV was also similar in HCV(+) and HCV(-) patients. Serum 
      ALT levels were 19 +/- 16 and 20 +/- 12 U/l in TTV(+) and TTV(-) patients, 
      respectively. These results indicate that prevalence of TTV in a CAPD population is 
      similar to healthy controls, and other routes of transmission in addition to 
      parenteral routes might be involved in the transmission of TTV.

TI  - Investigation of the association between infection with Helicobacter pylori and with 
      TT virus, a novel DNA virus, in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer or ulcer scar.
PG  - 1289-93
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently, a novel DNA virus (TT virus; TTV) has been isolated. Enteric 
      transmission is suggested as a route of transmission of TTV, with high prevalence of 
      this virus infection in the general population, and age and geographical 
      distributions of TTV prevalence very similar to those of Helicobacterpylori 
      infection. We analysed an association between TTV and H. pylori infection in 
      patients with gastroduodenal ulcer or ulcer scar. METHODS: In 181 patients with a 
      gastroduodenal ulcer or ulcer scar (102 with a gastric lesion, 60 with a duodenal 
      lesion, and 19 with both sites involved), specimens were cultured for H. pylori and 
      TTV infection was sought in serum by a polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: H. pylori 
      infection was demonstrated in 152 patients (84.0%) and TTV was detected in 168 
      patients (92.8%). Patients with TTV were significantly older than those without TTV 
      (P = 0.0001), while no age difference was observed between patients with and without 
      H. pylori infection. No difference was apparent in the prevalence of TTV infection 
      between patients with and without H. pylori infection, and vice versa. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We found no association between TTV infection and H. pylori infection in patients 
      with peptic ulcer diseases, which is consistent with a lack of association between 
      TTV infection and peptic ulcer. However, larger studies including surveys of the 
      general population will be required to analyse the overall association between TTV 
      and H. pylori.

LID - 10.1111/j.1440-1746.2008.05454.x [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the present study was to describe the clinicopathological 
      characteristics and the natural history of acute non-(A-E) hepatitis and to assess 
      the possible role of hepatitis G virus (HGV), TT virus (TTV) and mainly SEN virus 
      (SENV). METHODS: A cohort of 55 patients with sporadic acute non-(A-E) hepatitis 
      with a mean follow up of 31 (6-55) months was studied. RESULTS: The clinical 
      presentation was fulminant in one (1.8%), protracted with impaired regeneration in 
      seven (12.7%) and benign in the remaining 47 (85.5%) cases. Progression to chronic 
      hepatitis was observed in 15 (27.3%) patients; it was more frequent in clinically 
      severe than in non-severe cases (five of eight patients or 62.5% vs 10 of 47 
      patients or 21.3%, P = 0.028). Six of 10 biopsied chronic non-(A-E) cases developed 
      cirrhosis within 10-33 months. Serum HGV-RNA was detected in 16 of 55 (29.1%) 
      patients, TTV in 20 of 38 (52.6%) patients and SENV-D/H DNA in 20 of 55 (36.4%) 
      cases. HGV-RNA was detected more frequently in clinically severe than in non-severe 
      cases (five of eight or 62.5% vs 11 of 47 or 23.4%, P = 0.038). There was no other 
      association between the presence of HGV, TTV, or SENV infection and patient 
      characteristics or severity and outcome of disease. CONCLUSIONS: HGV, TTV, and SENV 
      do not seem to be responsible for the majority of sporadic acute non-(A-E) hepatitis 
      cases. Our cohort further supports the existence of new, unknown hepatitis agent(s) 
      with uncertain mode of transmission. The non-(A-E) agent(s) can also cause chronic 
      hepatitis, which often has an aggressive course with rapid development of cirrhosis.

TI  - High co-prevalence of genogroup 1 TT virus and human papillomavirus is associated 
      with poor clinical outcome of laryngeal carcinoma.
PG  - 402-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aetiology and factors leading to the progression of laryngeal cancer 
      are still unclear. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) has been suggested to play a 
      role, reports concerning the effect of HPV infection on tumour development are 
      controversial. Recently, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) was suggested to play a 
      role in certain infections as a causative or coinfecting agent. AIMS: To investigate 
      whether the development and progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is 
      associated with coinfection with TTV and HPV. METHODS: The prevalence of TTV and HPV 
      was investigated using the polymerase chain reaction in tissue samples from 40 
      healthy individuals, 10 patients with recurrent papillomatosis, five patients with 
      papillomatosis with malignant transformation, and 25 patients with laryngeal 
      carcinoma. The obtained prevalence data were compared and analysed statistically. 
      RESULTS: In the 11 patients with carcinoma who had metastasis or relapse there was a 
      high rate of coinfection with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV (eight of 11), whereas in the 
      14 without tumour progression no coinfection was found. Coinfection was associated 
      with significantly lower tumour free survival in patients with carcinoma (p < 
      0.001). Furthermore, four of five patients who had papillomatosis with malignant 
      transformation were coinfected with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      the nature of cooperation between HPV and TTV needs to be investigated further, 
      coinfection with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV appears to be associated with poor clinical 
      outcome in laryngeal cancer.

PG  - 220-1
AB  - The development of new technologies leads to the discovery of new viruses. For each 
      of these new infectious agents, their possible relevance to blood transfusion needs 
      to be assessed. The questions to be answered are transmissibility by transfusion, 
      pathogenicity, prevalence in blood donors, persistence, and the availability of 
      screening assays. Since 1995, three new viruses have been identified and extensively 
      studied.

TI  - The response of hepatitis C virus and TT virus to high dose and long duration 
      interferon-alpha therapy in naïve chronic hepatitis C patients.
PG  - 9-18
AB  - To investigate responses of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TT virus (TTV) to high dose 
      and long duration interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy (540 million units in 36 
      weeks) and factors associated with the viral clearance, sera of 165 Taiwanese naïve 
      chronic hepatitis C patients were tested for alanine aminotransferase, HCV RNA 
      levels, HCV genotypes and TTV DNA. With 41.8% of TTV DNA prevalence, TTV viremia was 
      significantly associated with history of blood transfusion (P<0.01). After IFN 
      therapy, HCV complete response was achieved in 60 (36.4%) patients and significantly 
      associated with lower pretreatment levels of HCV RNA (P<0.01) and HCV genotype 
      non-1b (P<0.05). Fifty-three patients with concurrent TTV infection were evaluated 
      for TTV response. TTV sustained clearance was achieved in 24 (48%) patients and 
      significantly associated with loss of TTV DNA at the end point of treatment. In 
      conclusion, concurrent TTV infection is highly prevalent, related to blood 
      transfusion and independent of HCV infection. After high dose and long duration 
      IFN-alpha therapy, HCV and TTV clearance are achieved among more than one-third and 
      around one-half patients. HCV RNA levels and HCV genotypes are predictors for HCV 
      response and no clinical factors are observed to be associated with TTV clearance.

TI  - Transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in dental patients.
PG  - 184-7
AB  - Transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) is a new DNA virus found in patients with 
      post-transfusion hepatitis. The prevalence of this virus among dental patients has 
      not been reported, therefore, the prevalence of TTV infection in consecutive dental 
      inpatients was evaluated. TTV DNA was assayed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      in 441 dental inpatients with oral cancer (n=192) or oral cysts (n=249). The serum 
      HBs antigen and HCV antibody as well as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine 
      transaminase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (gamma-GTP) concentrations 
      were also measured. Of 441 subjects, 137 were infected with TTV (31.1%). This 
      prevalence of TTV was much higher than that of HBV or HCV (HBV 1.2%; HCV 6.0%) in 
      these dental patients. There was no gender or age difference in the prevalence of 
      TTV infection. Of the 192 patients with oral cancer, 57 subjects had TTV in their 
      sera, while 80 of 249 with oral cystic disease had TTV. The prevalence of TTV was 
      similar between the two different disease groups. Neither the serum ALT nor serum 
      AST concentrations were different between the subjects positive and negative for TTV 
      DNA. In hospitalized dental patients, 31.1% were infected with TTV. The prevalence 
      of TTV was much higher than that of HBV or HCV. There was no difference in the 
      prevalence of TTV between subjects with cancer and cysts. Dentists should maintain 
      high standards of infection control when treating any dental patient.

PG  - 1172-7
AB  - A 43-mm hepatic tumor was incidentally detected by computed tomography in a 
      72-year-old man. Liver function test results were normal. Serum hepatitis B, C and G 
      viruses were negative, while serum TT virus was positive. Autoantibodies were 
      negative. The patient had no history of alcohol consumption. The tumor was found to 
      be a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from a resected 
      specimen. Neither lobular inflammation nor fibrosis was observed in the surrounding 
      liver. Intrahepatic hepatitis B virus was not detected. This is a case of non-B, 
      non-C HCC positive for only TT virus arising from a non-cirrhotic liver.

TI  - Lack of transmission of TT virus through immunoglobulins.
PG  - 1505-8
AB  - BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection has been found in patients 
      who received blood or blood components. Viral DNA was demonstrated in commercial 
      preparations of FVIII and F IX, but very few data have been reported on 
      immunoglobulins. The risk of TTV infection associated with intramuscular or IV 
      immunoglobulin administration is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalence 
      of TTV infection in a group of patients undergoing lifelong therapy because of 
      congenital immunodeficiency has been evaluated in a long term follow-up (median, 6 
      years). Seventeen patients with congenital immunodeficiency receiving monthly 
      administration of IVIG were included in the study. TTV DNA was repeatedly evaluated 
      by PCR in serum samples from each patient during the follow-up. Research of 
      antibodies against TTV was not applicable, as the patients studied were unable to 
      produce antibodies. The presence of TTV was also evaluated in 15 IVIG lots. RESULTS: 
      The total amount of immunoglobulin administered was 18,773 g. TTV infection was not 
      found in any patients included in the study. None of the 15 immunoglobulin 
      preparations analyzed was found positive for TTV DNA. CONCLUSION: Despite the high 
      prevalence of TTV in blood donors, commercial immunoglobulins are safe and unable to 
      transmit TTV.

TI  - TT virus infection in adult beta-thalassemia major patients.
PG  - 39-43
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Patients with thalassemia-major are at risk of 
      blood-borne viral infections. TT virus (TTV), a single stranded, circular DNA virus, 
      has recently been found to be associated with acute and chronic hepatitis. The aims 
      of this study were to assess the prevalence of TTV infection in adult patients with 
      transfusion-dependent thalassemia, and to evaluate the clinical significance of TTV. 
      DESIGN AND METHODS: We studied 68 adult patients with thalassemia major, 97% of whom 
      were hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive. TTV DNA was amplified from serum by 
      heminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Direct sequencing of PCR products was 
      used to establish TTV genotypes. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 47 patients 
      (69.1%). Sequence analysis of PCR products identified TTV genotype 1b as the most 
      common viral genotype in this group. Patients co-infected by HCV and TTV had a 
      significantly higher histologic grade score than patients with isolated HCV 
      infection (5.1+/-2.7 vs. 2.8+/-1.7, p=0.02) while the stage score was not 
      significantly different. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: TTV is highly prevalent 
      among Italian multiply transfused patients. In these patients TTV viremia appears to 
      affect the necro-inflammatory activity of hepatitis C, though no evidence of an 
      effect on the evolution of fibrosis was found.

TI  - [Relationship between TT virus infection and hepatocellular carcinoma].
PG  - 627-30
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between TT virus (TTV) infection and the 
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: TTV was examined in sera of 
      112 patients with HCC and 95 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) without HCC. 
      30 patients without liver disease were examined as control. TTV DNA was detected by 
      the second generation of TTV PCR primers (NG059, NG061 and NG063) after extraction 
      of DNA from 50 microliters serum. The relationship between TTV infection and 
      clinical features of each group patients was analyzed. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected 
      in 17.86% (20/112) of HCC patients, and this prevalence in HCC patients was not 
      significantly higher than that of TTV DNA in CLD patients (15.78%, 15/95). There 
      were no significant differences in age, gender, tumor factors (size, TNM 
      classification and markers) and other hepatitis virus markers between TTV-positive 
      and TTV-negative in HCC and CLD patients, except history of blood transfusion 
      [(80.00% vs 35.87% (P < 0.05) in HCC patients and 73.33% vs 27.50% (P < 0.05) in CLD 
      patients)] and ALT [(93 +/- 27) IU/L vs (68 +/- 31) IU/L (P < 0.05) in HCC 
      patients]. It seemed that TTV did not do any harm to the liver function of patients 
      who infected with HBV or HCV, except for elevating ALT level in such a kind of HCC 
      patients. CONCLUSION: Although TTV could do harm to the liver function of HCC 
      patients, it does not contribute to the development of HCC from CLD.

TI  - [Risk factors of TT virus infection in children up to 3 years].
PG  - 465-70
AB  - Significant frequency of TT virus (TTV) infections and its unclear pathogenetic role 
      are purposes for which investigators are interested in theme of spread of the virus. 
      It is considered parenteral way of TTV spread, oral-fecal, droplets, vertical, by 
      breastfeeding and other ways. THE AIM OF THE STUDY: To estimate the risk of TTV 
      infection by various ways and to asses the risk factors of infection. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: To the analysis were enrolled 55 patients, in 27 (49%) of them we confirmed 
      TTV infection (polymerase chain reaction method with two primers sets). We analyzed 
      frequency of infections dependence on risk factors vertical, parenteral, and enteral 
      infections. RESULTS: Disturbances in pregnancy or delivery were not connect to 
      frequency of TTV infections. We're not confirming this frequency dependence on 
      number of past hospitalizations but it was dependence between frequency of TTV 
      infections and chronic diseases and mental-physical retardation of children 
      (p=0.077; p=0.01). It was not confirming significant differences in depend on 
      dwelling place. Children from worse social conditions were infected more often 
      (p=0.05). It was not significant dependence between frequency of TTV infections and 
      breastfeeding. It was confirmed that in children of parents with chronic diseases 
      and children with brothers and sisters with chronic diseases are infected more often 
      (for mothers p=0.054; fathers p=0.04, brothers or sisters p=0.062). CONCLUSIONS: TTV 
      infections are more frequent in infants and young children exposed to often contacts 
      with medical environment, children from poor social conditions and with chronic 
      diseases in near family.

TI  - SEN Virus infection in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.
PG  - 495-9
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is currently one of the most 
      relevant coinfections in HIV positive patients. The influence of SEN Virus (SENV) on 
      the outcome of HCV therapy in HIV/HCV coinfected patients who underwent combination 
      therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin is unclear. METHODS: SENV 
      DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction in 67 HIV/HCV coinfected patients, 
      77 HIV monoinfected patients, 95 treatment naive HCV monoinfetcted patients, and 122 
      healthy blood donors. Quantitative analysis was done for SENV H DNA. RESULTS: SENV 
      DNA was detected in 8 of 67 (12%) HIV/HCV coinfected patients, in 9 of 77 (11.7%) 
      HIV monoinfected patients, in 21 of 95 (22%) HCV monoinfected patients, and 12 of 
      122 (9.8%) healthy blood donors. HIV monoinfected patients showed the highest mean 
      SENV H DNA level. The mean SENV H DNA was significantly lower in HIV/HCV coinfected 
      patients compared to all other groups. The sustained virological response rates to 
      combination therapy of HCV in HIV/HCV coinfected patients did not differ between 
      patients with detectable SENV 5/8 (62.5%) and without SENV 28/59 (47.5%; p = 0.47). 
      We found no significant difference in SENV H DNA pretreatment levels between 
      nonresponders and responders to combination therapy (112 +/- 144 copies vs. 8 +/- 7 
      copies/ml; p = 0.27). CONCLUSION: Coinfection with HCV may reduce SENV H replication 
      in HIV positive patients and results in significantly lower SENV H DNA levels in 
      HIV/HCV coinfected patients. SENV infection has no influence on the outcome of HCV 
      combination therapy in HIV/HCV coinfected patients.

TI  - SEN virus has an adverse effect on the survival of HIV-positive patients.
PG  - 1091-6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients infected with HIV are often coinfected with other viruses. 
      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of SEN virus (SENV) strains D and H on 
      mortality in HIV-positive patients. METHODS: A total of 217 HIV-positive patients 
      were analysed retrospectively after first presentation and blood sampling (January 
      1997 to July 1997) and the effect of coinfection with SENV-D and SENV-H on survival 
      was examined. Analysis periods were the time from blood sampling to the end of 
      follow-up, and the time from diagnosis of HIV infection to the end of study 
      follow-up. SENV-H DNA was measured quantitatively. Prevalences of SENV-D and SENV-H 
      were compared with those in 112 healthy blood donors. RESULTS: SENV prevalence was 
      significantly higher in HIV-positive patients than in controls (56/217 and 12/112, 
      respectively; P < 0.001). SENV positivity had no influence on survival, but a 
      significant negative influence of SENV-H on survival was observed when SENV-H DNA 
      was > 530 copies/ml, which was the mean SENV-H DNA level found in HIV-negative 
      controls. This adverse effect was found for both studied time periods in a 
      Kaplan-Meier analyses. A multivariate Cox regression analysis, including CD4 cell 
      count, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stage, age, sex, HIV RNA, highly 
      active antiretroviral therapy and hepatitis C virus status, revealed that a high 
      SENV DNA level was an independent risk factor or indicator for adverse disease 
      outcome. CONCLUSION: SENV infection is common in HIV-positive patients. High SENV-H 
      DNA levels were predictive for poor survival in HIV-positive patients.

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors jointly determine the susceptibility to develop 
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved 
      substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility 
      to MS. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the 
      HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes. 
      Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and 
      for non-MHC regions. The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction 
      with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact 
      that infections have long been associated with MS development. Current data suggest 
      that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the 
      general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which 
      predisposes for MS development. In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of 
      infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS 
      inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into 
      human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model 
      systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS.

TI  - Investigation of transfusion transmitted viruses in cases clinically suspected of 
      posttransfusion hepatitis with undetermined ethiology.
PG  - 157-65
AB  - Transfusion transmitted viruses (TTV) were investigated in cardiac surgery cases who 
      were previously transfused with blood and/or blood products and were suspected of 
      having posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) based on the results of physical examination, 
      clinical findings, biochemical blood test results and in a smaller number, on 
      radiological results. They were identified as having non-A-C hepatitis based on 
      serological or molecular test methods. In this study, out of 90 cases suspected for 
      PTH and non-A-C, 78 (86.7%) were male, 12 (13.3%) were female and their ages were 
      between 17 and 67. Ninety healthy blood donors, who donated blood for the first time 
      and had never had a transfusion, were selected as the control group. They had 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels < 40 U, were seronegative for hepatitis B 
      virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Seventy-seven were immune, and 13 were 
      seronegative for hepatitis A virus (HAV). In this study, TTV-deoxyribonucleic acid 
      (DNA) investigation was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method 
      suggested by Takahashi et al. with 5' GCT ACG TCA CTA ACC ACG TG 3' (T801) and 5' 
      CTG CGG TGT GTA AAC TCA CC 3' (T935) primers. TTV-DNA was found to be positive in 21 
      (23.3%) of the patient group and 4 (4.4%) of the control group (p < 0.05). In the 
      patients determined to be TTV-DNA positive, the admission time following transfusion 
      was a minimum of 3, and a maximum of 15 (average 7) weeks. The average ALT levels 
      detected at the time of admission did not show a difference between TTV-DNA positive 
      and negative cases (p > 0.05). However the ALT levels had a tendency to rise and 
      reached their highest level nine weeks after transfusion in the TTV-DNA positive 
      cases, although in two cases the ALT levels decreased to normal value after the 13th 
      week. During the 24 month follow up of the TTV-DNA positives all cases except one 
      were positive at the end of this period. The results of this study are the same as 
      those reported in the literature suggesting that TTV-DNA, excluding the main viral 
      agents which are known to cause PTH, can be determined in transfused PTH or 
      non-transfused asymptomatic patients in varying ratios. In order to define the 
      epidemiological properties and hepatic-extrahepatic pathologies more clearly we have 
      looked for evidence of the viral agent, which probably contaminates both by 
      transfusion and non-transfusion routes. It is suggested that, in addition to the 
      case groups in this study, new clinical studies are necessary including transfused 
      but non-PTH patients.

TI  - Postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome produced in gnotobiotic pigs following 
      exposure to various amounts of porcine circovirus type 2a or type 2b.
PG  - 229-39
LID - 10.1016/j.vetmic.2011.05.038 [doi]
AB  - In late 2005, a postweaning, high mortality syndrome spread rapidly through 
      finishing barns in swine dense areas of the United States. Diagnostic investigations 
      consistently detected porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) from diseased tissues. 
      Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that the infectious agent was a PCV2 type 
      termed "PCV2b". Prior to late 2004, only the PCV2a type, but not PCV2b, had been 
      reported in North America. In this communication, we produce severe postweaning 
      multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in gnotobiotic pigs using infectious PCV2a and 
      PCV2b generated from DNA clones constructed from field isolates identified in the 
      2005 outbreak. Clinical signs exhibited by diseased pigs included anorexia, dyspnea 
      and listlessness. Mortality was typically observed within 12h of onset of dyspnea. 
      The most striking microscopic lesions in affected animals were severe hepatic 
      necrosis and depletion of germinal centers in lymph nodes with associated abundant 
      PCV2 viral antigen. Clinical signs and lesions observed in these studies were 
      comparable to those reported in experiments with gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with a 
      PCV2a isolate while concurrently receiving immune-stimulation or co-infection with 
      porcine parvovirus or torque teno virus. The animals in these studies were confirmed 
      to be free of detectable porcine parvovirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory 
      syndrome virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, swine hepatitis E virus, and aerobic 
      and anaerobic bacteria. Seven out of 24 PCV2 inoculated pigs had a detectable 
      congenital torque teno virus infection with no correlation to clinical disease. 
      Thus, in these studies, both PCV2a and PCV2b isolates were singularly capable of 
      inducing high mortality in the absence of any detectable infectious co-factor.

TI  - Poor association of TT virus viremia with hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 247-52
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between TT virus (TTV) 
      infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. METHODS: TTV from serum 
      was examined in 224 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 106 patients 
      with chronic liver disease (CLD) but without HCC who were admitted to our hospital 
      between 1995-1997. As controls, 48 patients without liver disease were also 
      examined. TTV DNA was detected using nested PCR method after extraction of DNA from 
      serum. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 29/224 (13%) of patients with HCC; in 14% 
      (4/28) of HCC patients negative for both hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) 
      and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV), in 9% (2/22) of HCC patients 
      positive for HBsAg, and in 12% (21/170) of HCC patients positive for anti-HCV. The 
      prevalence of TTV DNA in HCC patients (13%) was not significantly higher than in CLD 
      patients (22%). There were no significant differences in age, gender, liver 
      function, tumor biology (size, TNM classification), other viral markers, or amount 
      of alcohol intake between TTV-positive and -negative HCC patients. Only a history of 
      blood transfusion was significantly more frequent in TTV-positive HCC patients than 
      in TTV-negative cases (p= 0.02). Coinfection with TTV did not correlate with the 
      severity of HCV-positive liver disease. There was no significant difference in 
      prognosis between TTV-positive and -negative HCC patients. CONCLUSIONS: TTV does not 
      seem to contribute to the development of HCC from chronic liver disease and is not 
      correlated with severity of liver disease.

TI  - Presence and significance of transfusion-transmitted virus infection in Iranian 
      patients on maintenance hemodialysis.
PG  - 106-11
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), a recently discovered 
      DNA virus, was first identified in patients with non-A to -G hepatitis following 
      blood transfusion. Transmission is generally via the parenteral route but recent 
      data suggest that TTV can also be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2005 and included 324 patients on 
      maintenance hemodialysis (HD) at 3 different centers in Tabriz, Iran. Demographic 
      and clinical data were recorded. Blood samples for virological and biochemical tests 
      were drawn simultaneously. TTV DNA was detected using semi-nested polymerase chain 
      reaction. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
      aminotransferase were also measured. RESULTS: Overall seroprevalence of TTV was 9.3% 
      (95% confidence interval, 6.1-12.5%). Prevalence rates of hepatitis B surface 
      antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, and hepatitis E virus antibody were 4.6% 
      (15/324), 20.4% (66/324), and 7.4% (24/324), respectively. Patients were negative 
      for human immunodeficiency virus antibody. There was no association between TTV 
      infection and elevated ALT levels. TTV-positive patients were significantly younger 
      than TTV-negative patients (p=0.018). There was no significant association between 
      TTV positivity and age, gender, duration of HD, positivity for hepatitis B, C, or E 
      virus infection markers, and history of transfusion and transplantation. CONCLUSION: 
      We observed low TTV prevalence and no association between TTV and blood-borne 
      infections in our HD patients. TTV infection was not related to elevated levels of 
      liver enzymes; however, the clinical impact of this virus need further 
      investigations.

TI  - Coinfection of TT virus and response to interferon therapy in patients with chronic 
      hepatitis B or C.
PG  - 567-70
AB  - AIM: To investigate the serum positive percentage of TT virus (TTV) in patients with 
      chronic hepatitis B or C and the response of the coinfected TTV to interferon (IFN) 
      during IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis B and C. METHODS: We retrospectively 
      studied the serum samples of 70 patients with chronic hepatitis who had received 
      IFN-alpha therapy from January 1997 to June 2000, which included 40 cases of 
      hepatitis B and 30 hepatitis C. All the patients had been followed up for at least 6 
      months after the end of IFN therapy. The serum TTV DNA was detected using the 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before and every month during the course of IFN 
      treatment. RESULTS: TTV infection was detected in 15% (6/40) of the chronic 
      hepatitis B group and 30% (9/30) of the chronic hepatitis C group. Loss of serum TTV 
      DNA during IFN therapy occurred in 3 of 6 patients (50%) and 6 of 9 (67%) of 
      hepatitis B and C groups, respectively. Seronegativity of TTV was found all during 
      the first month of IFN therapy in the 9 patients. There was no correlation between 
      the seroconversion of TTV and the biochemical changes of the patients. CONCLUSION: 
      TTV is not infrequently coinfected in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in 
      Taiwan, and more than half of the TTV infections are IFN-sensitive. However, the 
      loss of serum TTV DNA does not affect the clinical course of the patients with 
      chronic hepatitis B or C.

TI  - Cost projections for implementation of safety interventions to prevent 
      transfusion-transmitted Zika virus infection in the United States.
PG  - 1625-1633
LID - 10.1111/trf.14164 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In August 2016, the Food and Drug Administration advised US blood 
      centers to screen all whole blood and apheresis donations for Zika virus (ZIKV) with 
      an individual-donor nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) or to use approved pathogen reduction 
      technology (PRT). The cost of implementing this guidance nationally has not been 
      assessed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Scenarios were constructed to characterize 
      approaches to ZIKV screening, including universal ID-NAT, risk-based seasonal 
      allowance of minipool (MP) NAT by state, and universal MP-NAT. Data from the 2015 
      National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) were used to characterize 
      the number of donations nationally and by state. For each scenario, the estimated 
      cost per donor ($3-$9 for MP-NAT, $7-$13 for ID-NAT) was multiplied by the estimated 
      number of relevant donations from the NBCUS. Cost of PRT was calculated by 
      multiplying the cost per unit ($50-$125) by the number of units approved for PRT. 
      Prediction intervals for costs were generated using Monte Carlo simulation methods. 
      RESULTS: Screening all donations in the 50 states and DC for ZIKV by ID-NAT would 
      cost $137 million (95% confidence interval [CI], $109-$167) annually. Allowing 
      seasonal MP-NAT in states with lower ZIKV risk could reduce NAT screening costs by 
      18% to 25%. Application of PRT to all platelet (PLT) and plasma units would cost 
      $213 million (95% CI, $156-$304). CONCLUSION: Universal ID-NAT screening for ZIKV 
      will cost US blood centers more than $100 million annually. The high cost of PRT for 
      apheresis PLTs and plasma could be mitigated if, once validated, testing for 
      transfusion transmissible pathogens could be eliminated.

TI  - Presence of TT virus infection in chronic hepatitis patients from a hospital in New 
      Delhi, India.
PG  - 29-33
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: The recent discovery of a novel parenterally transmitted, 
      unenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus called TT virus (TTV) in chronic hepatitis 
      patients with unclear pathogenesis throughout the world led us to investigate, its 
      presence in chronic hepatitis patients attending a hospital in New Delhi, India, and 
      to evaluate its role in liver disease. METHODS: TT virus DNA was investigated in 
      serum samples of 70 patients with various types of chronic hepatitis, and 100 
      healthy subjects from New Delhi, India by nested PCR using the primers that belonged 
      to UTR (A) region of the genome. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 6 of 23 patients 
      (26%) with type B chronic hepatitis, 3 of 20 patients (15%) with type C chronic 
      hepatitis, and 12 of 100 subjects (12%) from healthy control group with normal liver 
      function profile tests. None of the 27 non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis patients had 
      TTV DNA positivity. The prevalence of TTV was significantly higher in type-B chronic 
      hepatitis patients as compared to normal subjects (P< 0.05) but comparable to type C 
      chronic hepatitis patients. The clinical course and biochemical profiles of type B, 
      or type C chronic hepatitis patients co-infected with TTV did not differ 
      significantly from those without TTV infection. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: 
      Interestingly, in chronic hepatitis patients, TTV was always associated with either 
      hepatitis B or C virus indicating a likely parenteral route of transmission. All 
      TTV-positive subjects in healthy control group showed normal clinical and 
      biochemical profiles. Thus, the presence of TTV infection is unlikely to influence 
      the course of chronic hepatitis related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV) or cause liver diseases in healthy subjects.

TI  - The epidemiology of TT virus (TTV) infection in a hepatitis C and B virus 
      hyperendemic area of southern Taiwan.
PG  - 500-9
AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly isolated DNA virus from the serum of a patient with 
      posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology in 1997. To evaluate the clinical and 
      molecular characteristics of TT virus (TTV) in a hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B (HBV) 
      hyperendemic area (Masago), 200 residents were enrolled in the study. The sera were 
      tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HCV RNA and GB virus C/Hepatitis G virus 
      (HGV) RNA, TTV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HCV and antibodies to HGV E2-protein (anti-E2). TTV 
      DNA was positive in 99 of the 200 sera with a prevalence rate of 49.5%. The 
      prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, HGV RNA, anti-E2 and HGV exposure (defined 
      as positive for serum HGV RNA and/or anti-E2) was 38.9%, 69.5%, 64.5%, 17.0%, 25.5% 
      and 39.5%, respectively. Neither clinical nor virological factors were associated 
      with TTV viremia. The rate of ALT abnormality was significantly elevated in HCV 
      RNA-positive (34.9%) than -negative (7.0%) residents (p < 0.001). HCV viremia was 
      the only factor significantly associated with ALT elevation by multiple logistic 
      regression (odds ratio: 6.96; 95% C.I.: 2.60-18.7). We concluded that in this 
      HCV/HBV hyperendemic area, the prevalence of TTV DNA was high. No significant 
      clinical factor was observed to be associated with TTV infection. TTV infection is 
      not related to abnormal ALT levels and ALT abnormality was mainly attributable to 
      HCV but not TTV, HBV or HGV infection.

TI  - [Detection of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) DNA in sera among three different 
      population groups in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire in 2001].
PG  - 85-6
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the transfusion transmitted Virus (TTV) 
      prevalence in three groups of population from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The A group 
      contained 39 multitransfused patients, the B group contained 10 blood donors 
      supposed to be healthy persons which have never been transfused and the group C 
      contained 43 patients with chronic liver pathology. In this last group, 33 patients 
      had HBV positive serology and the 10 others, HCV positive serology. We used PCR to 
      investigate TTV in patients serum. Detection rates were comprised between 67% and 
      82%. This is the first study to provide information about the high portage of TTV in 
      ivorian population.

TI  - Men having sex with men in Surakarta, Indonesia: demographics, behavioral 
      characteristics and prevalence of blood borne pathogens.
PG  - 1032-47
AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of human 
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
      hepatitis D virus (HDV), human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), Torque 
      teno virus (TTV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection among men who have sex 
      with men (MSM) in Surakarta, Indonesia, and the risk factors and sexual behavior 
      associated with these infections. A cross sectional study was performed from October 
      2009 to October 2011 among 143 MSM by face-to-face interviews to complete an 
      interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects were tested for ,HIV, HBV, HCV, 
      HDV, HTLV-1/2 and toxoplasma infection using serology and for TTV using molecular 
      detection. The seropositive rates for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, 
      anti-HTLV-1/2, IgM anti-T. gondii, IgG anti-T, gondii and TTV DNA were 9.1%, 9.8%, 
      28.0%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 30.8%, and 26.6%, respectively. Risk factors associated 
      with HIV infection were a history of injecting drug use (IDU) [adjusted OR (aOR) 
      6.0; 95% CI: 1.10-33.01] and a receptive role in sexual activity (aOR 8.1; 95% CI: 
      1.30-50.04) [corrected]. Having a tattoo (aOR 3.2; 95% CI: 1.28-7.98) and practicing 
      both anal and vaginal sex without a condom (aOR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.06-4.92) were 
      associated with toxoplasma infection. A history of IDU (aOR 32; 95% CI: 5.93-177.93) 
      was associated with TTV infection. The subjects examined in this study were found to 
      be infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2, TTV, and T. gondii. These infections 
      were associated with high-risk behavior.

TI  - Investigation of TT virus in the etiology of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
PG  - 543-51
AB  - Infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pediatric acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A novel human DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), has been 
      identified in children possessing characteristics as an etiologic agent, making the 
      virus a potential candidate. Analysis of specimens from children with ALL was 
      performed to determine if an association exists. Archived specimens (79 peripheral 
      blood mononuclear cells, PBMC/bone marrow cells, BMC, and 125 cerebrospinal fluid, 
      CSF) obtained at diagnosis and during therapy from 28 pediatric patients were tested 
      for TTV. All of the diagnostic BMC/PBMC were negative for TTV, but 7 patients had 
      follow-up specimens that converted to TTV positivity. TTV was not detected in any 
      CSF. The absence of TTV at diagnosis suggests TTV is unlikely to be causally 
      associated with ALL in the cases analyzed. However, the data support TTV 
      transmission through blood products and suggest that the CNS is not a sanctuary site 
      for TTV.

TI  - SEN virus infection in Egyptian patients with chronic hepatitis C and patients 
      undergoing hemodialysis.
PG  - 290
AB  - The SEN virus has been tentatively linked to transfusion-associated non-A to E 
      hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to 1) determine the prevalence of SEN 
      virus among Egyptian patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver 
      disease and patients undergoing hemodialysis and 2) demonstrate the clinical effect 
      of SEN virus infection on coexistent hepatitis C in terms of severity and 
      probability of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Polymerase chain reaction was 
      used to detect SEN virus-D and SEN virus-H DNA in serum samples of 74 patients with 
      HCV-related chronic liver disease, 45 uremic patients undergoing maintenance 
      hemodialysis, and 28 healthy controls. SEN virus-D/H DNA was detected in 13.5% of 
      patients with chronic liver disease, 11.1% of patients undergoing hemodialysis, and 
      7.1% of healthy controls, with no significant differences between patients and the 
      control group. Clinical and biochemical measures did not significantly differ 
      between SEN virus-infected and noninfected patients in the chronic liver disease 
      group or the hemodialysis group. The rate of SEN virus infection was significantly 
      higher in patients with chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (33.3%) 
      than in those with chronic liver disease only (8.5%) (P < .05). In conclusion, SEN 
      virus does not seem to be a common infection in Egyptian patients. It has no 
      apparent influence on the severity of coexistent HCV-related chronic liver disease 
      but could be a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in such patients. Further 
      studies are needed to define the etiopathogenic role of SEN virus infection in the 
      development of hepatocellular carcinoma.

TI  - Response of TT virus to IFN plus ribavirin treatment in patients with chronic 
      hepatitis C.
PG  - 143-6
AB  - AIM: TT virus (TTV) is a newly described DNA virus related to postransfusion 
      hepatitis that produces persistent viremia in the absence of clinical 
      manifestations. PEG-IFN plus ribavirin have been useful in the treatment of chronic 
      hepatitis C infection. This study investigated the responses of TT virus (TTV) and 
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin therapy. METHODS: Fifteen patients 
      infected with HCV were treated with PEG-IFN(0.5 microg/body weight/week) and 
      ribavirin (1 000 mg-1 200 mg/daily) for 48 weeks. Blood samples were drawn at the 
      beginning and the end of the therapy. Serum TTV DNA and HCV RNA were quantified by 
      real time PCR. RESULTS: At the beginning of treatment, TTV infection was detected in 
      10/15 (66.6%) of HCV-infected patients. Loss of serum TTV DNA at the end of therapy 
      occurred in 6/10 (60%) patients. Out of these 6 patients, 4 (67%) became positive 
      for TTV DNA after 6 months of therapy. Regarding HCV viremia, 11/15 (73%) patients 
      were negative for serum HCV RNA after 48 weeks of therapy, 7/11 (64%) of these cases 
      also became negative for TTV DNA following the combined treatment. In the 3/4 (75%) 
      patients who were positive for HCV RNA at the end of therapy, TTV DNA was detected 
      as well. Sustained HCV response at 6 months after treatment was 53% (8/15). 
      CONCLUSION: No TTV sustained response can be achieved in any patient after PEG-IFN 
      plus ribavirin administration.

TI  - Impact of SEN virus on immunoblot INNO-LIA HCV reactivity pattern and disease 
      outcome in Egyptian hepatocellular carcinoma patients.
PG  - 1-10
AB  - Recently, a novel virus designated SEN virus (SENV), which is thought to be related 
      to posttransfusion hepatitis, was discovered. The aim of the present study was to 
      investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of 2 SENV variants (SENV-D and 
      SENV-H) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy adults. Also, to 
      investigate the possible effect of SEN virus on the humoral immune response against 
      different proteins of HCV through analyzing reactivity patterns of the confirmatory 
      INNO-LIA HCV Ab III update in relation to SEN viremia. We investigated SEN virus 
      infection in 41 patients with HCC (25 males and 16 females) and twenty healthy blood 
      donors (12 males and 8 females). All samples were taken from the National Cancer 
      Institute, Cairo University. We used semi nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      amplification to detect SENV-D and SENV-H strains in serum. All patients were tested 
      against HCV antibody by ELISA and HCV viremia by RT-PCR. Furthermore, nineteen 
      patients positive for HCV antibody by EIA (10 positive for SEN DNA and 9 non viremic 
      for SEN) were confirmed in the immunoblot assay. SENV DNA was detected in 68 % (28 
      of 41) of patients with HCC and in 64 % (21 of 33) HCV-related HCC, in comparison to 
      5% (1 of 20) healthy blood donor populations. The blood biochemical parameters, and 
      performance status did not differ significantly between the SENV DNA-positive and- 
      negative patients. However, the overall survival rate was 50 % after two years 
      follow up in SENV DNA-positive and 14 % in SENV DNA-negative HCC patients. 
      Reactivity to NS5 and E2 were less (22 % and 44 % of cases) in SENV negative cases, 
      than in SENV positive cases (70 % and 80 % of cases, respectively). In conclusion, 
      SENV DNA seems to be highly prevalent among Egyptian HCC patients. Cross reactivity 
      between SENV proteins and HCV NS5, E2 or the increased immune response in SENV 
      positive cases and consequently the increased reactivity to HCV NS5 and E2 proteins 
      could not be ruled out. Although there was no apparent effect of SENV on biochemical 
      tests, survival rates of SENV DNA-positive HCC patients were higher thannegative 
      cases, which might be due to other factors affecting survival in our Egyptian HCC 
      patients.

TI  - TT virus is distributed in various leukocyte subpopulations at distinct levels, with 
      the highest viral load in granulocytes.
PG  - 242-8
AB  - When TT virus (TTV) DNA was quantitated in whole blood and plasma aliquots from 27 
      viremic individuals by real-time detection PCR that can detect essentially all TTV 
      genotypes, the TTV load was 6.9 +/- 3.5 (mean +/- standard deviation)-fold higher in 
      the whole blood than in the plasma samples [P < 0.002 (paired t test)]. To clarify 
      the reason for this difference, peripheral blood cells of various types including 
      red blood cells, granulocytes (CD15+), B cells (CD19+), T cells (CD3+), monocytes 
      (CD14+), and NK cells (CD3-/CD56+) were separated at a purity of 95.4-99.5% from 
      each of three infected individuals with relatively high TTV viremia, and their TTV 
      viral loads were determined. Red blood cells were uniformly negative, but the other 
      cell types were positive for TTV DNA at various titers. In all three patients, the 
      highest TTV load was found in granulocytes (4.2 x 10(4)-3.1 x 10(5) copies/10(6) 
      cells), followed by monocytes (1.4-2.2 x 10(4) copies/10(6) cells) and NK cells 
      (5.4-6.5 x 10(3) copies/10(6) cells); B and T cells were positive, with a low viral 
      load (6.7 x 10(1)-2.7 x 10(3) copies/10(6) cells). These results indicate that TTV 
      is distributed in various peripheral blood cell types at distinct levels, with the 
      highest viral load in granulocytes, and that a significant proportion of the TTV DNA 
      in peripheral blood is not identified by the standard plasma/serum DNA detection 
      methods.

TI  - No effect of transfusion transmitted virus viremia on the distribution and 
      activation of peripheral lymphocytes in hemodialyzed patients.
PG  - 933-7
AB  - AIM: We aimed to examine the distribution and activation of peripheral T cells in 
      TTV positive (n = 32) and negative (n = 17) hemodialyzed patients. The control group 
      (n = 20) consisted of healthy blood donors. METHOD: TTV-DNA was detected by 
      seminested PCR. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, CD3/HLA-DR, CD3/CD69 and the Th1/Th2 
      ratio of T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Circulating IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-4, 
      IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TNF-alpha, TGF-beta levels were measured by ELISA in the sera. 
      RESULTS: There was no difference between the CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 values of HD 
      subjects. In addition, the expression of both activation markers, HLA-DR and CD69, 
      was significantly elevated in the TTV-positive and -negative HD groups compared to 
      the controls, but not showing any difference from each other. The measurements of 
      intracellular cytokines showed the enhanced occurrence of INF-gamma + CD4 T cells, 
      and decreased appearance of IL-4 + CD4 lymphocytes in the HD groups without any 
      significant difference between the TTV virus positive and negative patients. In 
      addition, HD also elevated the expression of IL-10 in CD4 and CD8 (Th2) cells. There 
      were only two significant changes in the levels of circulating cytokines: (a) IL-2 
      increased; (b) IL-13 decreased in both groups of HD patients compared to the 
      controls, independently of TTV positivity or negativity. CONCLUSIONS: We assume that 
      transfusion-transmitted virus does not cause any specific change in the distribution 
      and activation of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of hemodialyzed patients. 
      Hemodialysis itself, however, results in a significant activation of peripheral T 
      cells with the domination of increased production of Th1 type cytokines, IFN-gamma, 
      IL-2, in contrast to the decreased synthesis of Th2 type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13. 
      Furthermore, the increased expression of IL-10 in the CD4 and CD8 cells of HD 
      patients can be the sign of a contraregulatory Th2 activation as an answer on the 
      Th1 effect.

TI  - SEN virus infection in Egyptian patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis: 
      prevalence and clinical importance.
PG  - 464-70
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: SEN virus (SENV) is assumed to be responsible for 
      post-transfusion non-A to -E hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis of SENV has shown 9 
      different strains. Two strains, SENV-H and SENV-D, were described as possible 
      candidates for post-transfusion hepatitis. This study examined the prevalence of 
      SENV infection and its clinical importance for patients undergoing hemodialysis. 
      METHODS: Serum samples were obtained from 63 long-term hemodialysis patients, and 
      examined for SENV-H and SENV-D viremia by polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples 
      were also obtained from 20 patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) who were not 
      undergoing hemodialysis and from 20 apparently healthy blood donors to act as 
      controls. For SENV screening, a primer pair was used for the conserved ORF1 region 
      among all SENV genotypes from A to I. RESULTS: SENV infection was significantly more 
      frequent among hemodialysis patients (33/63; 52.4%) and those with CKD (10/20; 
      50.0%) than among the control participants (2/20; 10.0%) [p = 0.003]. Twenty three 
      of 33 hemodialysis patients had SENV-H or -D, 61% of whom were positive for SENV-H 
      only, 4% were positive for SENV-D only, and 36% were positive for both SENV-H and 
      SENV-D. SENV infection was not associated with age, sex, amount or duration of 
      hemodialysis, or liver function test results. Elevated alanine aminotransferase was 
      significantly associated with HCV viremia, but not with SENV infection. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Egyptian hemodialysis patients and those with CKD are at higher risk for SENV 
      transmission. SENV-H is more prevalent than SENV-D.

TI  - Prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus infection in patients on maintenance 
      hemodialysis from New Delhi, India.
PG  - 362-6
AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) has been reported from a number of hemodialysis 
      (HD) units from various countries throughout the world. TTV has been associated with 
      liver diseases, viral hepatitis B, and C. Clinical details and information regarding 
      TTV prevalence from India are insufficient. The prevalence and clinical significance 
      of TTV infection were studied in New Delhi, India in HD patients. Serum samples were 
      derived from 75 patients on maintenance HD, and 75 age- and sex-matched voluntary 
      blood donors were examined for TTV viremia by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      using primers derived from UTR (A) region of the TTV genome. The prevalence of TTV 
      DNA in patients on HD (83%) was significantly (p<0.05) higher than in blood donors 
      (43%). Clinical background including the mean age, sex, mean duration of HD, and 
      mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels did not differ significantly between TTV 
      DNA-positive and -negative HD patients. Fifty-four (72%) TTV-positive HD patients 
      and 7 (56%) TTV-negative HD patients had blood transfusion histories (p>0.05). Among 
      TTV-positive patients, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection was present in 14.2% 
      cases while hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection was absent. Persistent elevation of 
      ALT levels was observed in 7(9.3%) HD patients; 3 (43%) of them were TTV positive 
      and 4 (57%) were TTV negative (p>0.05). All 3 TTV-positive patients with elevated 
      ALT levels were co-infected with HBV. Patients with TTV infection alone showed 
      normal ALT levels. Prevalence of TTV infection is high in North Indian patients on 
      maintenance HD. Also, none of the exclusively TTV DNA-positive patients had clinical 
      or biochemical signs of liver disease. TTV seems to spread through parenteral 
      routes. More often, TTV seems to be associated with parenterally transmitted virus 
      HBV, indicating a parenteral mode of TTV transmission. The pathogenicity of TTV 
      remains unclear from the present study.

TI  - SEN virus co-infection among HCV-RNA-positive mothers, risk of transmission to the 
      offspring and outcome of child infection during a 1-year follow-up.
PG  - 355-9
AB  - SEN is a newly discovered blood-transmissible virus. Among its variants, SENV-D and 
      -H are most often associated with non-A, -E hepatitis. Very little is known about 
      the risk of vertical transmission of the virus. By using polymerase chain reaction 
      with specific primers for SENV-D and -H, we investigated the prevalence of SENV-H 
      and -D infection, the transmission rate of SENV infection and clinical features of 
      SENV-infected children in 89 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive human immunodeficiency 
      virus type 1-negative mothers. SENV infection was found in 36 (40%) mothers, and 
      SENV-D was more frequent than SENV-H infection (34/36, 94%vs 5/36, 14%, P < 0.01). 
      No difference in SENV infection rates was found between injection drug user (IDU) 
      mothers (17/51, 33%) and mothers with no risk for bloodborne infection (19/38, 50%, 
      P = ns). SENV-H infection was found only in IDU mothers and mothers with HCV 
      genotype1b. Both SENV-D and -H can be transmitted to the offspring with an overall 
      rate of 47%. Vertical transmission of HCV does not facilitate SENV infection of the 
      offspring. Among 17 SENV-infected children, none was co-infected with HCV. Maternal 
      HCV genotype or viral load does not interfere with mother-to-infant transmission of 
      SENV. Persistence of SENV infection was demonstrated in 100% of infected children 
      after 1-year follow-up, but none had clinical evidence of liver disease.

TI  - Molecular detection of transfusion transmitted virus coinfection with some 
      hepatotropic viruses.
PG  - 1680-3
AB  - CONTEXT: A novel human DNA virus was isolated from the serum of a patient with 
      posttransfusion hepatitis; it was named transfusion transmitted virus (TTV). 
      OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the influence of TTV (detected by polymerase chain reaction 
      amplification of a conserved region of the viral genome) coinfection in individuals 
      infected with hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C) and to investigate the putative role 
      played by TTV in hepatic dysfunction in individuals with acute non-A-E hepatitis. 
      DESIGN: Sixty-two patients with viral hepatitis were included in the study in 
      addition to 18 blood donors. Viral study of 4 hepatotropic viruses (A, B, C, and E) 
      was carried out. Study for TTV DNA was performed by nested polymerase chain 
      reaction. RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV was not statistically different between 
      hepatitis patients and blood donors, and it was not correlated to the levels of the 
      hepatic aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase between individuals 
      evidencing dual infection with hepatitis B and C viruses and healthy blood donors. 
      However, in the group of patients with viral hepatitis of unknown etiology 
      (non-A-E), those evidencing TTV viremia had statistically significant lower levels 
      of alanine aminotransferase (P = .03) and aspartate aminotransferase (P = .04) than 
      those who were TTV negative. CONCLUSIONS: We can conclude that TTV is a frequent 
      virus isolated from patients with various types of viral hepatitis, from cases of 
      hepatitis without obvious viral agent, and from the healthy population. TTV has no 
      effect on biochemical markers of associated viral hepatitis. It may be associated 
      with a mild form of non-A-E hepatitis.

TI  - TT virus among blood donors in Alexandria.
PG  - 651-64
AB  - TTV is a non enveloped, single-stranded, circular- DNA virus that has been assigned 
      to the Family Circiniviridae. The primary mode of TTV transmission was proposed to 
      be transfusion (and hence its name). Little is known about the clinical significance 
      and the natural history of TTV infection. Hence, responsibility of the virus for 
      specific liver disease is still debated. In our study, we tested ninety five blood 
      donors attending Kom EL-Decka regional blood bank in Alexandria for the presence of 
      TTV DNA in their sera by PCR technique. The same samples were tested for ALT and AST 
      levels by colorimetric technique and for HBsAg and anti-HCV by the ELISA technique. 
      Out of the 95 blood donors, 46 (48.4%) had TTV DNA in their sera. None of the 95 
      blood donors included in this study was positive for HBsAg, while 22 (23.2%) were 
      anti-HCV positive. Out of the 22 anti-HCV positive blood donors, 13 (59.1%) were TTV 
      DNA positive, while out of the 73 anti-HCV negative blood donors, 33 (45.2%) had TTV 
      DNA in their sera. There was no statistically significant difference between the 
      prevalence of TTV DNA and anti-HCV in blood donors. No biochemical evidence of liver 
      disease potentially linked to the TTV infection was observed in our blood donors who 
      were TTV DNA positive. Furthermore, the occurrence of elevated serum AST and ALT was 
      most often linked to HCV rather than TTV.

TI  - Torque teno virus in liver diseases: On the way towards unity of view.
PG  - 1691-1707
LID - 10.3748/wjg.v26.i15.1691 [doi]
AB  - The review presents the data accumulated for more than 20 years of research of 
      torque teno virus (TTV). Its molecular genetic structure, immunobiology, 
      epidemiology, diagnostic methods, possible replication sites, and pathogenicity 
      factors are described. TTV is a virus that is frequently detectable in patients with 
      different viral hepatitides, in cases of hepatitis without an obvious viral agent, 
      as well as in a healthy population. There is evidence suggesting that biochemical 
      and histological changes occur in liver tissue and bile duct epithelium in TTV 
      monoinfection. There are sufficient histological signs of liver damage, which 
      confirm that the virus can undergo a replicative cycle in hepatocytes. Along with 
      this, cytological hybridization in TTV-infected cells has shown no substantial 
      cytopathic (cell-damaging) effects that are characteristic of pathogenic 
      hepatotropic viruses. Studying TTV has led to the evolution of views on its role in 
      the development of human pathology. The first ideas about the hepatotropism of the 
      virus were gradually reformed as new data became available on the prevalence of the 
      virus and its co-infection with other viruses, including the viruses of the known 
      types of hepatitides. The high prevalence of TTV in the human population indicates 
      its persistence in the body as a virome and a non-pathogenic virus. It has recently 
      been proposed that the level of TTV DNA in the blood of patients undergoing organ 
      transplantation should be used as an endogenous marker of the body's immune status. 
      The available data show the polytropism of the virus and deny the fact that TTV can 
      be assigned exclusively to hepatitis viruses. Fortunately, the rare detection of the 
      damaging effect of TTV on hepatic and bile duct epithelial cells may be indirect 
      evidence of its conditionally pathogenic properties. The ubiquity of the virus and 
      the variability of its existence in humans cannot put an end to its study.

TI  - Phylogenetic analysis of torque teno virus in hepatitis C virus infected patients in 
      shiraz.
PG  - 437-41
AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) was the first human Circoviridae detected in a 
      Japanese patient with unknown hepatitis in 1997. Subsequently, several studies 
      performed to evaluate different aspects of Torque teno virus pathogenesis. 
      OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to determine dominant genotype of Torque teno 
      virus in chronic hepatitis disease using 5΄-UTR sequence among patients infected by 
      hepatitis C virus in Shiraz - Iran. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study conducted in 240 
      patients with chronic hepatitis C from Prof. Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research 
      Center. The presence of Torque teno virus DNA and its genotype in plasma was 
      assessed by nested polymerase chain reaction using two primer sets for 5΄-UTR and 
      N22 regions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 5΄-UTR region. RESULTS: 
      DNA of Torque teno virus was detected in 220 out of 240 (92 %) patients with chronic 
      hepatitis C by the use of 5΄-UTR primer based PCR method and in 12 out of 240 (5%) 
      by the use of N22 primer. Based on phylogenetic analysis it was shown that the 
      Dominant genotype in this study was 11. Genotypes 1, 3, 17, and 22 were also 
      detected. Some sequences could not be classified to a specific genotype. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of Torque teno virus DNA in patients with chronic 
      hepatitis C disease by the use of 5΄-UTR primer appeared to be higher compared to 
      that revealed by N22 primer. We observed five genotypes among hepatitis C chronic 
      patients in our study.

TI  - Rapid detection of human torque teno viruses using high-resolution melting analysis.
PG  - 55-62
LID - 10.2478/bjmg-2013-0018 [doi]
AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are recently discovered DNA viruses, with heterogeneous 
      genomes, highly prevalent in populations worldwide. The species that infect humans 
      are Torque teno virus (TTV), Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) and Torque teno mini 
      virus (TTMV). High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) is a sensitive and effective 
      method for genotyping and mutation scanning. Up to now, HRMA has not been utilized 
      for detection of TTVs. The aim of this study was to asses if HRMA is suitable for 
      detecting TTVs variants. DNA was extracted from the blood and saliva of 13 healthy 
      subjects for method optimization. Additionally, saliva samples from 100 healthy 
      individuals were collected for estimating the TTVs' prevalence. Viral DNA was 
      amplified by heminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Second round amplicons were 
      used for the HRMA. The samples were analyzed using two fluorescent dyes, SYBR (®) 
      Green I and EvaGreen®. The prevalence values for TTV, TTMDV and TTMV were 71.0, 31.0 
      and 54.0%, respectively. The three major melting curve patterns corresponding to 
      TTV, TTMDV and TTMV on HRMA can be easily distinguished regardless of kit used. Our 
      results showed that HRMA is a rapid and efficient method of detecting human TTVs.

AB  - Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is rare, and many infectious agents have been 
      suspected for its etiology. This report presents an interesting case of KFD found 
      with torque teno virus/torque teno minivirus (TTV/TTMV), which closely resembles the 
      circovirus that causes necrotizing lymphadenitis in pigs. Three Korean patients 
      showed several enlarged lymph nodes in their neck. Quantitative polymerase chain 
      reaction (qPCR) and subsequent DNA sequencing for TTV/TTMV using formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissue were performed. Histologic examination demonstrated typical 
      features of KFD. qPCR showed successful amplification of TTV/TTMV, and DNA 
      sequencing confirmed the results. It is the first report of TTV/TTMV presence in 
      three patients with KFD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the prevalence of the Torque teno virus in healthy donors in 
      the northern and northwestern regions of the state of Paraná, southern Brazil. 
      METHODS: The Torque teno virus was detected by a nested polymerase chain reaction 
      using a set of oligoprimers for the N22 region. RESULTS: The prevalence of the virus 
      was 69% in 551 healthy blood donors in southern Brazil. There was no statistically 
      significant difference between the presence of the virus and the variables gender, 
      ethnicity and marital status. There was significant difference in the prevalence of 
      the virus regarding the age of the donors (p-value=0.024) with a higher incidence 
      (74.7%) in 18- to 24-year-old donors. CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of Torque teno 
      virus was observed in the population studied. Further studies are needed to 
      elucidate the routes of contamination and the clinical implications of the virus in 
      the healthy population.

TI  - Molecular characterization of human Torque Teno virus.
PG  - 821-826
AB  - The present study analyzed the presence of human Torque Teno virus (TTV) in 
      hospitalized patients from different departments. In total, 378 serum specimens were 
      collected from the patients (171 with cardiovascular disease, 192 with tumor and 15 
      with gastroenteritis) and analyzed by ELISA and nest-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      to detect the presence of TTV. The results showed that 64 specimens (17%) were TTV 
      positive from detection with the human ELISA kit, and the patients aged <30 years 
      have a higher prevalence. TTV in males was more common than in female patients. In 
      addition, nest-PCR was used to detect TTV within different phylogenetic groups among 
      the 64 specimens, and the results showed that groups 1 (TA278 strain), 4 (KC009) and 
      5 (CT39) were much more prevalent than groups 2 (PMV isolate) and 3 (11 genotypes) 
      in the different departmental patients.

TI  - Prevalence and impact of GBV-C, SEN-V and HBV occult infections in HIV-HCV 
      co-infected patients on HCV therapy.
PG  - 892-8
LID - 10.1016/j.jhep.2008.06.024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: It has been suggested that, in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, 
      co-infections with other viruses may affect the response to HCV therapy. We aimed to 
      assess the prevalence of GBV-C, SEN-V and occult HBV infections, their impact on HCV 
      and HIV infections and on the response to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected 
      patients. METHODS: Three-hundred and sixty eight patients were tested before 
      starting interferon-ribavirin for the presence of occult hepatitis B DNA, GBV-C RNA 
      and SEN-V DNA by using real time PCR. Clinical, immunological, virological, 
      histological characteristics and response to HCV therapy were compared according to 
      the presence or not of each viral co-infection. RESULTS: HBV DNA, GBV-C RNA and 
      SEN-V DNA were found in 5 (1.4%, CI95%: 0.2-2.4%), 104 (29.9%, CI95%: 25.1-34.7%) 
      and 209 patients (57.9%, CI95%: 52.8-63.0%), respectively. GBV-C positive patients 
      had significantly higher CD4 count at baseline, during and after HCV therapy, even 
      after stratification on antiretroviral treatment. No other significant difference 
      was observed according to the presence or not of GBV-C or SEN-V co-infection, in 
      particular regarding virological responses to HCV combination therapy. CONCLUSIONS: 
      There is no reason to withhold HCV therapy in HIV infected patients who have access 
      to HAART, because of occult HBV, GBV-C or SEN-V co-infections.

TI  - Detection of torque teno virus (TTV) in domestic village chickens in Iran.
PG  - 55-8
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is prevalent worldwide and has been extensively studied in 
      human and some wild and domestic animals. As the studies on TTV in chickens was rare 
      and there was no information about the infection of domestic village chickens with 
      TTV and also structural resemblance of this virus to chicken anemia virus, the 
      frequency of the infection in domestic village chickens in different villages in 
      Isfahan (Iran) was investigated. Sera were collected from 50 chickens. Viral DNA was 
      extracted and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the previously 
      described T801 and T935 primers that were used for amplification of a highly 
      conserved non-coding region (UTR) of the viral genome in a single round of PCR and 
      Set B primers of conserved region in a nested PCR reaction. Using T801 and T835 
      primers TTV or viruses of TTV family were detected in 16 out of 50 sera tested 
      (32%). Fourteen out of the same 50 sera (28%) were positive for TTV using Set B 
      primers. Totally 20 sera were positive using both primers (40%). Ten sera were 
      detected with both sets of primers, six sera with T801 and T935 primers and only 
      four sera were positive using Set B primers for TTV. Different patterns of the 
      detection of the virus with the two different sets of primers suggests the 
      possibility of the presence of different genotypes of TTV in domestic village 
      chickens and the possibility of the transmission of the virus from human to village 
      chickens and vice versa. This necessitates further investigations.

TI  - Quantification of Torque Teno Virus and Epstein-Barr Virus Is of Limited Value for 
      Predicting the Net State of Immunosuppression After Lung Transplantation.
PG  - ofy050
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofy050 [doi]
LID - ofy050
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major hurdles for survival after lung transplantation are rejections and 
      infectious complications. Adequate methods for monitoring immune suppression status 
      are lacking. Here, we evaluated quantification of torque teno virus (TTV) and 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as biomarkers for defining the net state of 
      immunosuppression in lung-transplanted patients. METHODS: This prospective 
      single-center study included 98 patients followed for 2 years after transplantation. 
      Bacterial infections, fungal infections, viral respiratory infections (VRTI), 
      cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and acute rejections, as well as TTV and EBV levels, 
      were monitored. RESULTS: The levels of torque teno virus DNA increased rapidly after 
      transplantation, likely due to immunosuppressive treatment. A modest increase in 
      levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was also observed after transplantation. There were 
      no associations between either TTV or EBV and infectious events or acute rejection, 
      respectively, during follow-up. When Tacrolimus was the main immunosuppressive 
      treatment, TTV DNA levels were significantly elevated 6-24 months after 
      transplantation as compared with Cyclosporine treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although 
      replication of TTV, but not EBV, appears to reflect the functionality of the immune 
      system, depending on the type of immunosuppressive treatment, quantification of TTV 
      or EBV as biomarkers has limited potential for defining the net state of immune 
      suppression.

TI  - Detection of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and Torque Teno virus in 
      subgingival and atheromatous plaques of cardiac patients with chronic periodontitis.
PG  - 456-460
LID - 10.4103/jisp.jisp_205_17 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Periodontitis and atherosclerosis represent a chronic inflammatory 
      process. The incidence of periodontitis in cardiac patients with atherosclerosis is 
      a well-established fact. The role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of both has 
      been proposed. AIM: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of Torque 
      Teno virus (TTV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in cardiac 
      patients with atherosclerosis and coexisting chronic periodontitis (CP). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Thirty patients (17 males and 13 females) with atherosclerotic plaques 
      and coexisting periodontitis were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Viral 
      DNA was extracted from the subgingival and atheromatous plaque. The presence of CMV, 
      EBV, and TTV in the plaque samples was identified using polymerase chain reaction. 
      The collected data were statistically analyzed for the prevalence of the viruses and 
      Chi-squared test was performed to find out its association with atheroma and CP. 
      RESULTS: The prevalence of CMV, EBV, and TTV in atheromatous plaque was 63.3%, 
      56.7%, and 46.7%, respectively, as compared to rates of 80%, 63.3%, and 53.3% in 
      subgingival plaque. Results also indicated no significant association of CMV, EBV, 
      and TTV in both samples (P = 0.08, 0.346, and 0.261, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: 
      There was no significant association of CMV, EBV, and TTV between subgingival and 
      atheromatous plaque. The prevalence of CMV, EBV, and TTV was high in atheromatous 
      plaque. TTV was isolated from more than 50% of participants in atheromatous plaque, 
      which is a significant finding.

AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) in humans is characterized by ubiquitous occurrence in 
      peripheral blood (PB), without any related disease described to date. Several 
      studies reported a significant increase of TTV plasma DNA levels in allogeneic 
      transplant recipients, and suggested a correlation of elevated virus titers with 
      immunosuppression and transplant-related complications. However, the site of viral 
      replication in this setting has remained unclear. We have studied TTV in serial 
      plasma specimens derived from 43 pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation (HSCT) recipients by RQ-PCR, and found increasing TTV-DNA levels in 
      all patients post-transplant, with a peak around day +100 and maximum virus copy 
      numbers reaching 4 × 10E9/ml. To assess whether the virus replicates in PB-cells, 
      leukocyte subsets including granulocytes, monocytes, NK-cells, T- and B-lymphocytes 
      were serially isolated by flow-sorting for TTV analysis in 19 patients. The virus 
      was undetectable in most cell types, but was identified in granulocytes in all 
      instances, revealing a median DNA copy number increase of 1.8 logs between days 
      +30-100 post-transplant. Our data therefore provide evidence for TTV replication in 
      granulocytes in this setting. In a control cohort of immunocompetent children and in 
      HSCT recipients before day +30, TTV positivity in granulocytes was less common 
      (33%), and the copy numbers were considerably lower. However, rising TTV replication 
      about 2 weeks after granulocyte engraftment (>500 cells/μl) was observed suggesting 
      that granulocyte recovery might be required for TTV expansion in severely 
      immunosuppressed transplant recipients.

TI  - Strong association of Torque teno virus/Torque teno-like minivirus to 
      Kikuchi-Fujimoto lymphadenitis (histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis) on 
      quantitative analysis.
PG  - 925-931
LID - 10.1007/s10067-019-04851-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare benign lymphadenitis that 
      mainly involves cervical lymph nodes of young Asian women with unknown etiology. 
      Recently, we experienced a case of KFD found with Torque teno virus/Torque teno-like 
      mini virus (TTV/TTMV) from a 26-year-old woman. TTV/TTMV is a genus of Circoviridae 
      that causes necrotizing lymphadenitis in pigs, which shares the key histologic 
      finding of KFD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the pathogenic role of 
      TTV/TTMV in KFD by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. METHOD: 
      We performed two-step qPCR specific to TTV/TTMV with formalin-fixed 
      paraffin-embedded tissue of sequentially selected 100 KFD patients and 50 randomly 
      selected, matched normal controls. Consequent direct sequencing was done for 
      confirmation with PCR products. RESULTS: PCR amplification of TTV and TTMV was found 
      in a significantly higher proportion in KFDs than normal controls (TTV, 85% vs. 18%, 
      p < 0.000; TTMV, 91% vs. 24%, p < 0.000). After the sequencing, KFD samples showed 
      more sequence matching than control samples for TTMV (94% vs. 30%, p < 0.000). 
      CONCLUSION: This finding strongly suggests the possible implication of TTV/TTMV in 
      the pathogenesis of KFD. Animal or in vivo experimental design should be followed in 
      the future.Key Points• Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is rare and its etiology is 
      still unclear.• Torque teno/Torque teno-like minivirus (TTV/TTMV) is a recently 
      introduced virus in the Circoviridae family that causes necrotizing lymphadenitis in 
      pigs, histologically similar to KFD.• We discovered the significantly increased 
      TTV/TTMV viral loads in the KFD patients than normal controls, which implicates 
      TTV/TTMV in the pathogenesis of KFD.

TI  - The Molecular Epidemiology and Phylogeny of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) in Jordan.
LID - 10.3390/v12020165 [doi]
LID - 165
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is the most common component of the human blood virobiota. 
      Little is known, however, about the prevalence of TTV in humans and the most common 
      farm domesticates in Jordan, or the history and modality of TTV transmission across 
      species lines. We therefore tested sera from 396 Jordanians and 171 farm animals for 
      the presence of TTV DNA using nested 5'-UTR-PCR. We then performed phylogenetic, 
      ordination and evolutionary diversity analyses on detected DNA sequences. We 
      detected a very high prevalence of TTV in Jordanians (~96%); much higher than in 
      farm animal domesticates (~29% pooled over species). TTV prevalence in the human 
      participants is not associated with geography, demography or physical attributes. 
      Phylogenetic, ordination and evolutionary diversity analyses indicated that TTV is 
      transmitted readily between humans across the geography of the country and between 
      various species of animal domesticates. However, the majority of animal TTV isolates 
      seem to derive from a single human-to-animal transmission event in the past, and 
      current human-animal transmission in either direction is relatively rare. In 
      conclusion, animal TTV in Jordan is historically derived from human variants; 
      however, ongoing human-animal TTV exchange is minimal and zoonotic infection seems 
      to be of limited importance.

TI  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) Among β-Thalassemia and Haemodialysis Patients in Mazandaran 
      Province (North of Iran).
PG  - 56-60
AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a transfusion transmitted virus that seems to be involved 
      in several complications such as acute respiratory diseases, liver diseases, AIDS, 
      cancer, and autoimmune reactions. In the present study the frequency of TTV was 
      investigated among β- thalassemia (BT) and haemodialysis (HD) patients (high risk 
      patients for TTV) in Mazandaran province, Iran. DNA was extracted from the serum of 
      82 BT and 100 HD patients, and nested PCR method was applied to detect TTV DNA. The 
      aspartate transaminase(AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) enzyme levels in BT 
      patients were measured using photometric assay. The mean age of BT and HD patients 
      as 23.4±5.4 and 48.8±8.2 years, respectively. 21% of HD and 26.8% of BT patients 
      were infected with TTV, respectively. The frequency of TTV was not significantly 
      different between two groups of patients and there was no significant correlation 
      between sex and TTV infection. The mean AST and ALT levels in TTV positive BT 
      patients was not significantly higher than TTV negative cases. The present study 
      showed that TTV prevalence in BT patients with recurrent blood transfusion was not 
      significantly higher than HD patients. The investigation of TTV prevalence in 
      healthy individuals is recommended to identify if transfusion or dialysis is 
      associated with higher TTV infection. Besides, although TTV infection did not change 
      the AST and ALT enzymes in BT patients, the liver involvement may still exist in 
      these patients.

TI  - New respiratory viruses and the elderly.
PG  - 61-9
LID - 10.2174/1874306401105010061 [doi]
AB  - The diagnostics of respiratory viral infections has improved markedly during the 
      last 15 years with the development of PCR techniques. Since 1997, several new 
      respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered: influenza A viruses 
      H5N1 and H1N1, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses SARS, NL63 and HKU1, human 
      bocavirus, human rhinoviruses C and D and potential respiratory pathogens, the KI 
      and WU polyomaviruses and the torque teno virus. The detection of previously known 
      viruses has also improved. Currently, a viral cause of respiratory illness is almost 
      exclusively identifiable in children, but in the elderly, the detection rates of a 
      viral etiology are below 40%, and this holds also true for exacerbations of chronic 
      respiratory illnesses. The new viruses cause respiratory symptoms like the common 
      cold, cough, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, exacerbations of asthma and chronic 
      obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure may occur. 
      These viruses are distributed throughout the globe and affect people of all ages. 
      Data regarding these viruses and the elderly are scarce. This review introduces 
      these new viruses and reviews their clinical significance, especially with regard to 
      the elderly population.

TI  - Clinical outcomes of Torque teno virus-infected thalassemic patients with and 
      without hepatitis C virus infection.
PG  - 123-7
LID - 10.5045/kjh.2011.46.2.123 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although a marked proportion of thalassemic patients acquire Torque teno 
      virus (TTV) through blood transfusion, its clinical importance is unclear. This 
      study was designed to investigate the clinical importance of TTV infection in 
      thalassemic patients with and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection in Iran. 
      METHODS: In this case-control study, 107 thalassemic patients on chronic transfusion 
      and 107 healthy individuals were selected. According to HCV and TTV infection status 
      (detected by semi-nested PCR), patients were categorized into 4 groups: TTV and HCV 
      negative, TTV positive, HCV positive, and TTV and HCV positive. Blood ferritin, 
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in these 
      4 groups were assessed. RESULTS: Approximately half of the thalassemic patients 
      (50.5%) and 27.1% of controls had TTV infection. Thalassemic patients had a greater 
      chance of TTV infection compared to the control group with a sex-adjusted OR of 4.13 
      (95% CI=2.28-8.13). The increased levels of ALT, AST, and ferritin in the TTV and 
      HCV-infected group were not significantly different from those in the TTV and HCV 
      negative group. Co-infection with TTV and HCV did not significantly increase ALT, 
      AST, and ferritin levels compared to infection with TTV alone. CONCLUSION: Although 
      common in thalassemic patients, TTV infection appears to have a negligible role in 
      increasing the severity of liver disease, even when co-infection with HCV occurs.

TI  - Association Between Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 Gene Polymorphisms and Torque 
      Teno Virus Infection After Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.
LID - 10.6002/ect.2017.0105 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: An association between costimulatory molecule gene polymorphisms and 
      viral infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation may be related to 
      clinical outcomes, especially acute graft-versus-host disease. Cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte antigen 4 has been suggested as a crucial negative regulator of the 
      immune system. In this study, our objective was to investigate the association 
      between cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 gene polymorphisms (including -1722 T/C, 
      -1661 A/G, -318 C/T, and +49 A/G) and torque teno virus infection after 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with and without acute 
      graft-versus-host disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study included 71 recipients. 
      We evaluated cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene polymorphisms using the 
      polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method. RESULTS: 
      Our results showed that the GG genotype of the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 +49 
      A/G was significantly more frequent in transplanted patients infected with torque 
      teno virus, whereas the AG genotype was more common in transplanted patients who did 
      not have this infection. In addition, the -1661 AA and GA genotypes and -318 TC 
      genotypes were significantly more frequent in transplanted patients infected with 
      the virus and who had low-grade (grades I and II) acute graft-versus-host disease. 
      Among those with grade I graft-versus-host disease, the GG genotype of the cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte antigen 4+49 A/G was more frequent in transplanted patients with torque 
      teno virus infection, whereas the AG genotype was higher in transplanted patients 
      who did not have this infection. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report indicating 
      that cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 gene polymorphism may be implicated in 
      prevalence of torque teno virus infection after stem cell transplant. Further larger 
      studies and evaluation of other costimulatory molecules are suggested.

TI  - The presence of Torque teno virus in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
PG  - 3461-6
AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been identified as transfusion-transmitted virus in 
      humans, initially. Although TTV viremia is extremely common in the general 
      population worldwide, there is no direct causal evidence linking TTV infection to 
      specific clinical manifestations. Our hypothesis was that TTV might play a role in 
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by inducing inflammatory mechanisms 
      previously identified. The study was conducted on 57 COPD patients and 39 healthy 
      control groups. COPD patient groups included: the patients (n:20) with exacerbation 
      needed noninvasive ventilation, the patients (n:19) who received only medical 
      treatment, and the invited patients (n:18) for outpatient control. Serum samples 
      were collected from patients and voluntary blood donors. TTV DNA quantification was 
      carried out with a real time PCR by the hybridization probe system and viral load 
      was interpreted through the crossing point value. TTV DNA was detected in the 
      majority of both patients and healthy control groups. The prevalence was 94.4% 
      (17/18) in patients for outpatient control, 94.7% (18/19) in patients who received 
      only medical treatment, 100% (20/20) in patients with exacerbation needed 
      noninvasive ventilation and 84.6% (33/39) in healthy controls. This difference was 
      not statistically significant. However, CP values was statistically different in all 
      the patient groups from the control group. TTV DNA prevalence was higher in patients 
      than healthy individuals. More interesting thing, viral load was highest in the 
      patients with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation. As a result, TTV may be 
      associated with COPD and the severity of it.

TI  - Human anelloviruses: diverse, omnipresent and commensal members of the virome.
PG  - 305-313
LID - 10.1093/femsre/fuaa007 [doi]
AB  - Anelloviruses are small, single stranded circular DNA viruses. They are extremely 
      diverse and have not been associated with any disease so far. Strikingly, these 
      small entities infect most probably the complete human population, and there are no 
      convincing examples demonstrating viral clearance from infected individuals. The 
      main transmission could be via fecal-oral or airway route, as infections occur at an 
      early age. However, due to the lack of an appropriate culture system, the virus-host 
      interactions remain enigmatic. Anelloviruses are obviously mysterious viruses, and 
      their impact on human life is not yet known, but, with no evidence of a disease 
      association, a potential beneficial effect on human health should also be 
      investigated.

TI  - The Value of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) as a Marker for the Degree of Immunosuppression 
      in Adult Patients after Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HSCT).

LID - S1083-8791(19)30742-6 [pii]

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded, circular DNA virus of 
      the family of Anelloviridae. The first contact with TTV usually occurs in early 
      childhood, followed by persistent infection in bone marrow and lymphocytes. 
      Increased levels of TTV-DNA are found in the serum in various states of immune 
      deficiency. The objective of this study was to assess if monitoring of TTV viremia 
      after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a predictive 
      marker for immune-related clinical complications. In a retrospective study, 2054 
      whole-blood samples from 123 patients were tested for viral loads of TTV-DNA by 
      real-time PCR within 345 days after allo-HSCT. We enrolled all patients who 
      underwent allo-HSCT between September 2015 and April 2018. Clinical and laboratory 
      data were collected and statistically analyzed. Patients with an underlying 
      lymphatic malignancy had significantly higher torque teno (TT) viral loads compared 
      with patients with an underlying malignant myeloid disease (P < .05). Complete 
      remission before allo-HSCT correlated significantly with higher TT viral loads after 
      allo-HSCT (P < .05). Myeloablative conditioning regimens led to significantly higher 
      TT viral loads than reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (P < .05). A higher 
      anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) dose was associated with a significantly higher TT 
      viral load. We did not observe any significant differences of TT viral load 
      correlating with accompanying clinically relevant events such as virus reactivations 
      (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Adenovirus), acute graft-versus-host disease 
      (aGVHD), relapse, or death. TT viral load after allo-HSCT did weakly correlate with 
      T cell, T suppressor cell, T helper cell, and natural killer and B cell count. 
      Although statistically significant differences between study groups were observed, 
      virus reactivations, aGVHD, and clinical outcomes could not be predicted by 
      monitoring TTV viremia. Therefore, TTV seems not to be suitable as a marker for the 
      degree of immunosuppression or as a prognostic marker for clinically critical events 
      in patients after allo-HSCT.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are icosahedral, single-stranded circular DNA viruses 
      infecting several vertebrate species. Currently, these viruses are considered 
      non-pathogenic although they are suggested to be co-factors in several diseases. 
      Recently single-stranded circular DNA viruses have been found in human faeces. 
      Considering the consumption of pork meat products and the ubiquitous nature of swine 
      TTV (Torque tenosus virus, TTSuV), the human population is frequently exposed to 
      these viruses. To determine if TTSuVs could be delivered through food, human faecal 
      samples were analysed for their presence. Indeed, the results of this study show 
      that up to 25% of faecal samples were positive for known TTSuVs by PCR and 
      sequencing. Additionally, all commercially available pork products purchased in 
      Spanish supermarkets contained DNA of TTSuV.

TI  - Torque teno virus and hepatitis C virus co-infection in Iranian pediatric 
      thalassemia patients.
PG  - 156-61
LID - 10.5505/tjh.2012.20280 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Torque teno virus (TTV) infects patients at risk for parenteral exposure 
      and chronic blood transfusion, such as those with β-thalassemic. This study aimed to 
      assess the prevalence of TTV infection and co-infection of TTV and hepatitis C virus 
      (HCV) in pediatric thalassemia patients receiving chronic blood transfusion. 
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 90 pediatric thalassemia patients receiving 
      chronic blood transfusion that presented to the Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran, 
      Iran. The control group included 90 healthy volunteer children. Serum TTV DNA 
      detection via semi-nested PCR and HCV Ab were performed in all the participants. 
      Demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected from each participant 
      for statistical analysis. RESULTS: In all, 64.4% of the patients had TTV infection, 
      versus 24.4% of the controls (P < 0.01). The thalassemia patients had a greater 
      probability of having TTV and HCV infections than the controls, with a common OR of 
      5.60 (95% CI: 2.94-10.69) and 2.15 (95% CI: 1.83-2.50), respectively. In total, 
      17.2% (10/58) of the patients that were TTV positive were also HCV positive, whereas 
      6.3% (2/32) of the TTV-negative patients were anti-HCV antibody (Ab) positive (P = 
      0.14). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TTV and HCV infection was higher in the Iranian 
      thalassemia patients on chronic transfusion therapy than in the controls. The high 
      prevalence of TTV in pediatric thalassemia patients on chromic transfusion therapy 
      may indicate the superiority of the parenteral route compared to other routs of TTV 
      transmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped DNA virus that its role as a 
      helper or causative agent in hepatitis is still unclear. TTV prevalence varies in 
      different regions of the world. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of TTV 
      in healthy individuals and those infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) living in 
      Yazd city, Iran. METHODS: In this case-control study, 50 healthy subjects and 68 
      HCV-positive individuals who referred to Yazd hospitals participated in this study. 
      TTV DNA in serum samples were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
      using specific primers of 5΄-UTR and N22 regions. The genotypes of HCV and TTV were 
      determined by sequencing method. RESULTS: TTV-DNA was detected in 2 out of 50 (4℅) 
      healthy individuals and in 4 out of 68 (5.8℅) HCV-positive persons. There was not a 
      significant correlation between the prevalence of TTV and HCV infection. The most 
      common TTV genotypes among HCV-positive individuals were 3, 17 and 13, respectively. 
      There was not a significant association obtained between HCV genotypes and TTV 
      genotypes. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TTV in Yazd province was low compared with 
      the other areas of Iran. The prevalence of TTV in HCV infected people was not 
      significantly higher than its rate in uninfected individuals.

TI  - Detection of torque teno sus virus infection in Indian pigs.
PG  - 1467-1471
LID - 10.14202/vetworld.2019.1467-1471 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are circular, single-stranded DNA 
      viruses, which infect a wide range of animals including livestock and companion 
      animals. Swine TTVs (torque teno sus viruses [TTSuVs]) are thought to act as a 
      primary or coinfecting pathogen in pathological conditions such as porcine 
      dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. 
      So far, the presence of the virus has not been reported in India. Considering that 
      TTSuVs have the potential to cross the species barrier into humans and that pork 
      consumption is common in North-Eastern states of India, the current study aims to 
      investigate the presence of TTSuV in the Indian pig population. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: A total of 416 samples were collected during 2014-2018, from both 
      apparently healthy pigs and also from pigs suspected of having died from classical 
      swine fever and/or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. These samples were 
      screened for TTSuV infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing 
      techniques. RESULTS: The presence of the virus was confirmed in 110 samples from 12 
      different states of India. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences 
      obtained from the PCR products indicated the presence of viruses of both 
      Iotatorquevirus and Kappatorquevirus genera in India. CONCLUSION: The study is the 
      first report on the presence of TTSuVs in India and highlights the circulation of 
      both genera of the virus in the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial outbreaks of viral etiology are costly and can have a major 
      impact on patient care. Many viruses are known to persist in the inanimate 
      environment and may pose a risk to patients and health care workers. We investigate 
      the frequency of environmental contamination with common health care-associated 
      viruses and explore the use of torque-teno virus as a marker of environmental 
      contamination. METHODS: Environmental screening for a variety of clinically relevant 
      viruses was carried out over 3 months in a UK pediatric hospital using air sampling 
      and surface swabbing. Swabs were tested for the presence of virus nucleic acid by 
      quantitative polymerase chain reactions. RESULTS: Viral nucleic acid was found on 
      surfaces and in the air throughout the screening period, with adenovirus DNA being 
      the most frequent. Door handles were frequently contaminated. Torque-teno virus was 
      also found at numerous sites. CONCLUSION: Evidence of environmental contamination 
      with viral pathogens is present in health care environments and may be indicative of 
      an infectious virus being present. Screening for viruses should be included in 
      infection control strategies. Torque-teno virus may provide a better marker of 
      contamination and reduce time and cost of screening for individual viruses.

TI  - Torque teno viral load reflects immunosuppression in paediatric kidney-transplanted 
      patients-a pilot study.
LID - 10.1007/s00467-020-04606-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic deterioration of kidney graft function is related to inadequate 
      immunosuppression (IS). A novel tool to assess the individual net state of IS in 
      transplanted patients might be the monitoring of Torque teno virus (TTV) viral load. 
      TTV is a non-pathogen virus detectable in almost all individuals. TTV level in the 
      peripheral blood has been linked to the immune-competence of its host and should 
      thus reflect IS after solid organ transplantation. METHODS: TTV plasma load was 
      quantified monthly by RT-PCR for a period of 1 year in 45 kidney-transplanted 
      children. Post-transplant time was at least 3 months. The relation of the virus DNA 
      levels to IS and transplant-specific clinical and laboratory parameters was analysed 
      longitudinally. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detectable in 94.5% of the plasma samples. 
      There was a significant association with the post-transplant follow-up time as well 
      as with the type of IS regimen, with lower virus loads in patients after longer 
      post-transplant time and mTOR inhibitor-based IS. Furthermore, a significant 
      positive correlation with the dose of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil was 
      found. CONCLUSIONS: TTV levels show an association/correlation with the strength of 
      IS. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate TTV measurement as a tool for IS 
      monitoring for hard clinical outcomes such as presence of donor-specific antibodies, 
      rejections or infections-common consequences of insufficient or too intense IS.

      in 2000, and torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) in 2007. These viruses are characterized 
      by an extremely high prevalence, with relatively uniform distribution worldwide and 
      a high level of genomic heterogeneity, as well as an apparent pan-tropism at the 
      host level. Although these viruses have a very high prevalence in the general 
      population across the globe, neither their interaction with their hosts nor their 
      direct involvement in the etiology of specific diseases are fully understood. Since 
      their discovery, human anelloviruses, and especially TTV, have been suggested to be 
      associated with various diseases, such as hepatitis, respiratory diseases, cancer, 
      hematological and autoimmune disorders, with few arguments for their direct 
      involvement. Recent studies have started to reveal interactions between TTVs and the 
      host's immune system, leading to new hypotheses for potential pathological 
      mechanisms of these viruses. In this review article, we discuss the most important 
      aspects and current status of human TTVs in order to guide future studies.

TI  - Association Between TT Virus Infection and Cirrhosis in Liver Transplant Patients.
PG  - e28370
LID - 10.5812/hepatmon.28370 [doi]
LID - e28370
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cirrhosis is one of the most severe liver complications, with multiple 
      etiologies. The torque teno virus (TTV), also known as transfusion transmitted 
      virus, which has a high incidence in the world population, is one of the possible 
      increasing risk factors in patients with idiopathic fulminant hepatitis and 
      cryptogenic cirrhosis. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate solitary 
      and co-infection with TTV, in patients with cryptogenic and determined cause of 
      cirrhosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 200 liver transplant 
      patients were consecutively recruited between years 2007 and 2011. Patients were 
      classified, based on recognition of the etiology of cirrhosis to determined (n = 81) 
      and cryptogenic (n = 119) patient groups. The existence of TTV infection was 
      analyzed, using a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction method. The presence of 
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infective markers, including HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface 
      antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), 
      and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), was evaluated using qualitative polymerase chain 
      reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay protocols, respectively. RESULTS: The 
      TTV infection was found in 37 of 200 (18.5%) and 53 of 200 (26.5%) plasma and tissue 
      samples of studied liver transplanted patients, respectively. The TTV genomic DNA 
      was found in 32 (26.9%) and 28 (23.5%) of 119 liver tissue and plasma samples of 
      transplanted patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, respectively. The genomic DNA of 
      TTV was also diagnosed in 21 (25.9%) and nine (11.1%) of the 81 liver tissue and 
      plasma samples of patients with determined cirrhosis, respectively. Significant 
      associations were found between TTV infection with HBV molecular and immunologic 
      infective markers, in liver transplanted patients, with determined and cryptogenic 
      cirrhosis. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the high frequency of solitary TTV and 
      co-infection with HBV, in both liver transplanted patients with cryptogenic and 
      determined cirrhosis, emphasized on the importance of TTV infection in the 
      development of cirrhosis, especially in the cases of cryptogenic ones, prompting for 
      further studies the confirm this agent in the etiology of determined cirrhosis.

AB  - CONTEXT: Data regarding the distribution of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-E alleles 
      and their association with blood-borne pathogen infections/co-infections are limited 
      for many populations, including Indonesia. AIMS: The aim of this study was to 
      analyze the association between HLA-E allelic variants and infection with 
      blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), 
      hepatitis D virus (HDV), torque teno virus (TTV), GB virus C (GBV-C), and Toxoplasma 
      gondii (T. gondii) in Indonesian Javanese human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 
      patients. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A total of 320 anti-HIV-positive blood samples were 
      analyzed for HBV, HCV, HDV, TTV, GBV-C, and T. gondii infection status and its 
      association with HLA-E allelic variants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nucleic acid was 
      extracted from plasma samples and used for the molecular detection of HBV DNA, HCV 
      RNA, HDV RNA, TTV DNA, and GBV-C RNA, whereas hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV, 
      immunoglobulin M and G (IgM and IgG) anti-T. gondii were detected through 
      serological testing. The blood samples were genotyped for HLA-E loci using a 
      sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED: 
      Either the Chi-square or Fisher's exact test was performed to analyze the frequency 
      of HLA-E alleles and blood-borne pathogen infections in the population. Odds ratios 
      (ORs) were calculated to measure the association between the antibodies found and 
      the participants' possible risk behaviors. A logistic regression analysis was used 
      to assess the associations. RESULTS: HLA-E*101/0101 was associated with HCV/TTV 
      co-infection (adjusted OR [aOR]: 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.156-10.734; P 
      = 0.027) and IgM/IgG anti-Toxo positivity (aOR: 27.0; 95% CI: 3.626-200.472; P = 
      0.001). HLA-E*103/0103 was associated with TTV co-infection (aOR: 2.7; 95% CI: 
      1.509-4.796; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: HLA-E alleles in Indonesian Javanese HIV 
      patients were found to be associated with HCV, TTV, and toxoplasma co-infections.

TI  - Study of the Associations Between TT Virus Single and Mixed Infections With 
      Leukemia.
PG  - e18212
LID - 10.5812/jjm.8(4)2015.18212 [doi]
LID - e18212
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathogenic association of Transfusion Transmitted Virus or Torque 
      teno Virus (TT Virus) single and mixed infections with leukemia was under evaluation 
      in these years but confront with controversies. This hypothesis is based on the 
      higher prevalence of TT Virus infection in patients with leukemia compared with 
      controls. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of TT 
      Virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) 
      infections in patients with leukemia and healthy controls. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 
      this cross sectional study, 95 patients with leukemia and 100 healthy controls who 
      were admitted to the Namazi Hospital affiliated to the Shiraz University of Medical 
      Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, were enrolled between years 2012 and 2013. Blood samples 
      treated with EDTA were collected from each patient with leukemia and controls. The 
      existence of TT Virus infection was analyzed using the semi-nested PCR method. The 
      immunological prevalence of HBV and HCV infections were evaluated using HBs-Ag and 
      HCV-Ab ELISA based protocols, respectively. Active CMV infection was also evaluated 
      using an immunofluorescence method. Also risk factors of leukemia and viral 
      infections were statistically analyzed in patients with leukemia. RESULTS: The TT 
      Virus infection was significantly found in 40 of 95 (42.1%) and 12 of 100 (12%) 
      patients with leukemia and controls, respectively. The HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab were 
      detected in 27 of 95 (28.4%) and 18 of 69 (26.1%) patients with leukemia but were 
      not found in the controls. Active CMV infection was also found in 11 of 69 (16%) 
      patients and none of the controls. Significant co-infection of TT Virus was found 
      with HBV (15 of 40; 37.5%), HCV (14 of 40; 35%) and CMV (7 of 40; 17.5%) in patients 
      with leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Confirmation of the significantly higher frequency of TT 
      Virus, HBV, HCV and CMV single infection and their co-infection in patients with 
      leukemia compared with healthy controls, emphasizes the determinative role of TT 
      Virus pathogenesis in clinical outcomes observed in patients with leukemia, which 
      requires extensive evaluation by further studies.

AB  - In addition to traditional risk factors such as smoking habits and alcohol 
      consumption, certain microbes also play an important role in the generation of head 
      and neck carcinomas. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types is strongly 
      associated with the development of oropharyngeal carcinoma, and Epstein-Barr virus 
      appears to be indispensable for the development of non-keratinizing squamous cell 
      carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Other viruses including torque teno virus and 
      hepatitis C virus may act as co-carcinogens, increasing the risk of malignant 
      transformation. A shift in the composition of the oral microbiome was associated 
      with the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, although the causal or casual 
      role of oral bacteria remains to be clarified. Conversion of ethanol to 
      acetaldehyde, a mutagenic compound, by members of the oral microflora as well as by 
      fungi including Candida albicans and others is a potential mechanism that may 
      increase oral cancer risk. In addition, distinct Candida spp. also produce NBMA 
      (N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine), a potent carcinogen. Inflammatory processes elicited 
      by microbes may also facilitate tumorigenesis in the head and neck region.

TI  - Viral metagenomics analysis of kidney donors and recipients: Torque teno virus 
      genotyping and prevalence.
LID - 10.1002/jmv.26298 [doi]
AB  - The viral load of the ubiquitous and nonpathogenic torque teno virus (TTV) is 
      associated with the grade of immunosuppression of its host. The development of 
      next-generation sequencing (NGS) allowed to describe the human virome of the blood 
      compartment in transplanted patients, and showed that TTV is the most important part 
      of the virome. This study is a descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing 
      plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. After sample processing, 
      nucleic acids were amplified by rolling circle amplification and submitted to NGS by 
      ion proton sequencing technology. Results were analyzed after mapping of reads on 
      the 29 TTV reference genomes and de novo assembling of the reads with MIRA software. 
      The number of TTV species present in donors and recipients was, on average, 12 in 
      donors and 33 in recipients. TTV species predominantly present in donors were TTV-13 
      and TTV-18; and in recipients were TTV-P15-2, TTV-27, TTV-HD14a, and TTV-22. We 
      highlighted a significant variability in abundance and composition in sequential 
      samples from recipients. Temporal evolution of TTV populations was clearly observed 
      in recipients, but no preferential transmission of a species from donor to recipient 
      was evidenced. Diversity and population expansion were observed in kidney 
      recipients. Further study of TTV species could help assess the potential impact of 
      each species of this virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: High viral loads are observed in Torque Teno Virus (TTV) infection after 
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to analyze the kinetics of 
      plasma TTV-DNA load in pediatric patients who received immunosuppressive therapy and 
      developed infection complications in the first 100 days after HSCT. METHODS: As a 
      patient group; 113 plasma samples taken from 33 pediatric HSCT recipients at a time 
      interval after transplantation and as a control group; 38 plasma samples from 38 
      children without known chronic disease were included in the study. Viral nucleic 
      acid isolation was performed by using the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMerieux, France) 
      system. A laboratory designed quantitative polymerase chain reaction process was 
      performed on 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) with the 
      amplification mixture containing primer and probe sequences for the UTR gene region. 
      RESULTS: TTV-DNA was detected in all patient's samples and the median viral load was 
      calculated as 7.67 Log(10) copies/mL (range: 2.84-9.59). In the control group, the 
      TTV-DNA median viral load was calculated as 5.51 Log(10) copies/mL (range: 
      2.50-7.04), except for one negative sample. A significant difference was observed 
      between the control group and the patient group in terms of TTV viral load levels. 
      In nine patients, a median 2.15 Log(10) copies/mL viral load increase was observed 
      at 31-60 days post-transplant compared to the pre-transplant period. CONCLUSION: 
      TTV-DNA levels should be closely monitored to understand the immune status of the 
      first 100 days after transplantation and the effects of treatment regimens on 
      patients with HSCT.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The virome is a network of viruses normally inhabiting humans. It forms 
      a conspicuous portion of the so-called microbiome, once generically referred to as 
      resident flora. Indeed, viruses infecting humans without leading to clinical disease 
      are increasingly recognized as part of the microbiome and have an impact on the 
      development of our immune system. In addition, they activate inflammasomes, 
      multiprotein complexes that assemble in cells and that are responsible for the 
      downstream effects of sensing pathogens. OBJECTIVE: This review aims at summarizing 
      the evidence on the role of the virome in modulating inflammation and emphasizes 
      evidence for Anelloviruses as useful molecular markers to monitor inflammatory 
      processes and immune system competence. METHOD: We carried out a review of the 
      literature published in the last 5 years and summarized older literature to take 
      into account ground-breaking discoveries concerning inflammasome assembly and 
      virome. RESULTS: A massive amount of data recently emerging demonstrate that the 
      microbiome closely reflects what we eat, and many other unexpected variables. 
      Composition, location, and amount of the microbiome have an impact on innate and 
      adaptive immune defences. Viruses making up the virome contribute to shaping the 
      immune system. Anelloviruses, the best known of such viruses, are present in most 
      human beings, persistently without causing apparent disease. Depending on their 
      interplay with such viruses, inflammasomes instruct host defences to tolerate or 
      forfeit a specific microorganism. CONCLUSION: The virome plays an important role in 
      shaping human immune defences and contributes to inflammatory processes by quenching 
      or increasing them.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol 
      and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding 
      environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For 
      this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 
      2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after 
      cleaning operations. METHODS: To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, 
      rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus 
      and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used. RESULTS: On the 
      whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the 
      researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both 
      surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was 
      concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral 
      presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important 
      source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection 
      can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread.

AB  - The microbiome, a thriving and complex microbial community colonizing the human 
      body, has a broad impact on human health. Colonization is a continuous process that 
      starts very early in life and occurs thanks to shrewd strategies microbes have 
      evolved to tackle a convoluted array of anatomical, physiological, and functional 
      barriers of the human body. Cumulative evidence shows that viruses are part of the 
      microbiome. This part, called virome, has a dynamic composition that reflects what 
      we eat, how and where we live, what we do, our genetic background, and other 
      unpredictable variables. Thus, the virome plays a chief role in shaping innate and 
      adaptive host immune defenses. Imbalance of normal microbial flora is thought to 
      trigger or exacerbate many acute and chronic disorders. A compelling example can be 
      found in the respiratory apparatus, where early-life viral infections are major 
      determinants for the development of allergic diseases, like asthma, and other 
      non-transmissible diseases. In this review, we focus on the virome and, 
      particularly, on Anelloviridae, a recently discovered virus family. Anelloviruses 
      are major components of the virome, present in most, if not all, human beings, where 
      they are acquired early in life and replicate persistently without causing apparent 
      disease. We will discuss how modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems by 
      Anelloviruses can influence the development of respiratory diseases in childhood and 
      provide evidence for the use of Anelloviruses as useful and practical molecular 
      markers to monitor inflammatory processes and immune system competence.

AB  - The presence of pathogenic viruses in healthcare settings represents a serious risk 
      for both staff and patients. Direct viral detection in the environment poses 
      significant technical problems and the indirect indicators currently in use suffer 
      from serious limitations. The aim of this study was to monitor surfaces and air in 
      hospital settings to reveal the presence of hepatitis C virus, human adenovirus, 
      norovirus, human rotavirus and torque teno virus by nucleic acid assays, in parallel 
      with measurements of total bacterial count and haemoglobin presence. In total, 114 
      surface and 62 air samples were collected. Bacterial contamination was very low (<1 
      cfu/cm(2)) on surfaces, whereas the 'medium' detected value in air was 282 cfu/m(3). 
      Overall, 19 (16.7%) surface samples tested positive for viral nucleic acids: one for 
      norovirus, one for human adenovirus and 17 (14.9%) for torque teno virus (TTV). Only 
      this latter virus was directly detected in 10 air samples (16.1%). Haemoglobin was 
      found on two surfaces. No relationship was found between viral, biochemical or 
      bacterial indicators. The data obtained confirm the difficulty of assessing viral 
      contamination using bacterial indicators. The frequent detection of TTV suggests its 
      possible use as an indicator for general viral contamination of the environment.

      infections.
LID - 10.1007/s00705-020-04841-x [doi]
AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a commensal human virus observed as a circular 
      single-negative-strand DNA molecule in various tissues and biological samples, 
      notably in blood serum and lymphocytes. TTV has no apparent clinical significance, 
      although it might be very useful as a prospective tool for gene delivery or as an 
      epidemiological marker. Human populations are ubiquitously infected with TTV; the 
      prevalence may reach 100%. The majority of babies become spontaneously infected with 
      TTV, so that by the end of the first year of life, the prevalence reaches 'adult' 
      values. TTV positivity in healthy early infancy and the presence of TTV in umbilical 
      cord blood samples have been reported. The mechanism of infection and the dynamics 
      of TTV prevalence in infants with age remain understudied. Meanwhile, the potential 
      diagnostic and prognostic value of TTV as a marker deserves special attention and 
      study, along with the possibility, causes and consequences of placental transmission 
      of TTV under normal or pathological conditions.

TI  - Diagnostic investigation of porcine periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome: lack of 
      compelling evidence linking to common porcine pathogens.
PG  - 96-106
LID - 10.1177/1040638711425939 [doi]
AB  - Porcine periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome (PFTS), an increasingly recognized 
      syndrome in the swine industry of North America, is characterized by the anorexia of 
      nursery pigs noticeable within 1 week of weaning, and progressive loss of body 
      condition and lethargy during the next 1-2 weeks. Morbidity caused by PFTS is 
      moderate, but case fatality is high. The etiology of PFTS is presently unknown and 
      may include infectious agent(s), noninfectious factors, or both. PFTS was identified 
      in a high health status farm with good management in early 2007. A diagnostic 
      investigation was undertaken to identify the pathological lesions of, and infectious 
      agents associated with, pigs demonstrating typical clinical signs. Affected 
      (PFTS-SICK) and unaffected (PFTS-HLTHY) pigs from an affected farm, and unaffected 
      pigs from 2 unaffected farms, were examined. The most prevalent lesions in PFTS-SICK 
      pigs were superficial lymphocytic fundic gastritis, atrophic enteritis, superficial 
      colitis, lymphocytic and neutrophilic rhinitis, mild nonsuppurative 
      meningoencephalitis, and thymic atrophy. Rotavirus A and Betacoronavirus 1 (Porcine 
      hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) were identified only in PFTS-SICK pigs, 
      but the significance of the viruses is uncertain because PFTS is not consistent with 
      the typical presentation following infection by these pathogens. Porcine 
      reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Porcine circovirus-2, Influenza A 
      virus, Alphacoronavirus 1 (Transmissible gastroenteritis virus), Torque teno virus 
      1, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, and Brachyspira pilosicoli were not identified in 
      PFTS-SICK pigs. Suid herpesvirus 2 (Porcine cytomegalovirus), Porcine enteric 
      calicivirus, Torque teno virus 2, pathogenic Escherichia coli, and coccidia were 
      detected in both PFTS-SICK and PFTS-HLTHY pigs. It was concluded that there is a 
      lack of compelling evidence that PFTS is caused by any of these pathogens.

AB  - Impaired immune reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell 
      transplantation (HSCT) contributes to increased risk of cancer relapse and infection 
      resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, effective 
      strategies to functionally assess the quality of immune reconstitution are still 
      missing. Quantification of in vivo replication of the ubiquitous, non-pathogenic 
      virus Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been reported in small series as a test to 
      functionally evaluate the quality of post-transplant immune reconstitution. In the 
      present study, we analyzed by quantitative PCR TTV titers in plasma samples from a 
      large cohort of 168 allogeneic HSCT recipients. Our analysis confirms that TTV 
      titers peaked at 100 days post-transplant, followed by progressive normalization 
      thereafter. Negative correlation of TTV titers with T cell absolute numbers during 
      the first year post-transplant points to the restoration of an active anti-TTV 
      immunity. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that 
      donor CMV positive serostatus, donor type and immune suppression resulting from GVHD 
      treatment affected the restoration of anti-TTV immunity. Importantly, higher TTV 
      titers at 100 days after transplantation were associated with worse overall survival 
      and higher risk of acute GVHD and infections. Our results provide new insights into 
      the factors affecting the dynamics of TTV replication and indicate that TTV is a 
      potentially useful biomarker to assess immune reconstitution and to predict 
      complications and outcomes of allogeneic HSCT.

TI  - Chicken anemia virus.
PG  - 151-83
AB  - Chicken anemia virus (CAV), the only member of the genus Gyrovirus of the 
      Circoviridae, is a ubiquitous pathogen of chickens and has a worldwide distribution. 
      CAV shares some similarities with Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno mini virus 
      (TTMV) such as coding for a protein inducing apoptosis and a protein with a 
      dual-specificity phosphatase. In contrast to TTV, the genome of CAV is highly 
      conserved. Another important difference is that CAV can be isolated in cell culture. 
      CAV produces a single polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA), which is translated into 
      three proteins. The promoter-enhancer region has four direct repeats resembling 
      estrogen response elements. Transcription is enhanced by estrogen and repressed by 
      at least two other transcription factors, one of which is COUP-TF1. A remarkable 
      feature of CAV is that the virus can remain latent in gonadal tissues in the 
      presence or absence of virus-neutralizing antibodies. In contrast to TTV, CAV can 
      cause clinical disease and subclinical immunosuppression especially affecting CD8+ T 
      lymphocytes. Clinical disease is associated with infection in newly hatched chicks 
      lacking maternal antibodies or older chickens with a compromised humoral immune 
      response.

AB  - In the past two decades or so, a number of viruses have emerged in the global swine 
      population. Some, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 
      (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), cause economically important diseases 
      in pigs, whereas others such as porcine torque teno virus (TTV), now known as Torque 
      teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and related novel parvoviruses, 
      porcine kobuvirus, porcine toroviruses (PToV) and porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses 
      (PLHV), are mostly subclinical in swine herds. Although some emerging swine viruses 
      such as swine hepatitis E virus (swine HEV), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) 
      and porcine sapovirus (porcine SaV) may have a limited clinical implication in swine 
      health, they do pose a potential public health concern in humans due to zoonotic 
      (swine HEV) or potential zoonotic (porcine SaV) and xenozoonotic (PERV, PLHV) risks. 
      Other emerging viruses such as Nipah virus, Bungowannah virus and Menangle virus not 
      only cause diseases in pigs but some also pose important zoonotic threat to humans. 
      This article focuses on emerging and re-emerging swine viruses that have a limited 
      or uncertain clinical and economic impact on pig health. The transmission, 
      epidemiology and pathogenic potential of these viruses are discussed. In addition, 
      the two economically important emerging viruses, PRRSV and PCV2, are also briefly 
      discussed to identify important knowledge gaps.

TI  - Development of PCR assays with nested primers specific for differential detection of 
      three human anelloviruses and early acquisition of dual or triple infection during 
      infancy.
PG  - 507-14
AB  - We recently identified a novel human virus classifiable into a third group in the 
      genus Anellovirus, tentatively designated torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a 
      circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb and genomic organization resembling those of torque 
      teno virus (TTV) (3.8 to 3.9 kb) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) (2.8 to 2.9 kb). 
      TTMDV was characterized by extreme genetic diversity similar to the TTV and TTMV 
      genomes. Taking advantage of universal and virus species-specific primers derived 
      from a highly conserved area located just downstream of the TATA box of the TTV, 
      TTMDV, and TTMV genomes, a PCR method with simultaneous amplification of the genomic 
      DNAs of these three anelloviruses in the first round and subsequent differential 
      amplifications of these viruses in the second round was developed. High prevalence 
      of TTMDV viremia was seen in adults (75/100 [75%]), comparable with the prevalences 
      of TTV viremia (100%) and TTMV viremia (82%). Although none of 10 cord blood samples 
      had detectable TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV DNAs, the prevalences of these three 
      anelloviruses increased with the number of months after birth of the individual and 
      reached 100% for individuals at one year of age. Dual or triple infection of TTV, 
      TTMDV, and/or TTMV was seen in 10 (47.6%) of 21 infants 9 to 180 days of age and 
      more frequently among infants 181 to 364 days of age (20/23 [86.9%]), comparable 
      with the 93.1% (243/261) prevalence among subjects 1 to 81 years of age, indicating 
      early acquisition of dual or triple anellovirus infection during infancy.

AB  - Porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4) is a DNA virus, and a member of the Parvoviridae family 
      within the Bocavirus genera. It was detected recently in swine, but its epidemiology 
      and pathology remain unclear. A TaqMan-based real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting a 
      conserved region of the ORF3 gene of PPV4 was developed. The qPCR detection limit 
      was 9.5 × 10(1) DNA copies/μL. There was no cross-reaction with porcine parvovirus, 
      torque teno virus 1, torque teno virus 2, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine 
      circovirus type 2, or with pseudorabies virus. Two hundred and seventy-two samples, 
      including serum, semen, lungs, feces, ovarian follicular fluids, ovaries and uterus, 
      were evaluated by qPCR and PPV4 was detected in 36 samples (13.2%). When compared 
      with a conventional PCR (cPCR), the qPCR assay was 10 times more sensitive and the 
      detection of PPV4 DNA in field samples was increased 2.5 times. Partial sequencing 
      of PPV4 ORF3 gene, obtained from two pooled samples of uterus and ovaries, revealed 
      a high nucleotide identity (98-99%) with a reference PPV4 sequence. The qPCR can be 
      used as a fast and accurate assay for the detection and quantification of PPV4 in 
      field samples and for epidemiological studies in swine herds.

AB  - Torque teno virus and related anelloviruses are a recent addition to the list of 
      agents that cause chronic productive infections and high levels of plasma viraemia 
      in humans. Many aspects of the natural history and pathogenesis of these under many 
      respects surprising viruses are still poorly understood. In this review, we briefly 
      outline the general properties of anelloviruses, examine what is currently known 
      about the interactions they establish with the central nervous system (CNS), and 
      discuss the possible pathological consequences.

TI  - Viral DNAemia and Immune Suppression in Pediatric Sepsis.
PG  - e14-e22
LID - 10.1097/PCC.0000000000001376 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Demonstrate that DNA viremia is common in pediatric sepsis and 
      quantitate its associations with host immune function and secondary infection risk. 
      DESIGN: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study. PATIENTS: 
      Seventy-three children admitted with sepsis-induced organ failure. INTERVENTIONS: 
      None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: This study was performed as an ancillary 
      investigation to a single-center prospective study of children with severe sepsis. 
      Longitudinally collected, batched, frozen plasma was examined using real 
      time-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr 
      virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus-6, torque teno virus, and adenovirus 
      DNA. Innate immune function was also measured longitudinally via quantification of 
      ex vivo lipopolysaccharide -induced tumor necrosis factor-α production capacity. 
      Viral DNAemia with a virus other than torque teno virus was detected in 28 of 73 
      subjects (38%) and included cytomegalovirus 5%, Epstein-Barr virus 11%, herpes 
      simplex virus 4%, human herpes virus-6 8%, and adenovirus 26%. In addition, torque 
      teno virus was detected in 89%. Epstein-Barr virus DNAemia was associated with 
      preexisting immune suppression (p = 0.007) Viral DNAemia was associated with 
      preexisting immune suppression and high risk for the subsequent development of 
      secondary infection (p < 0.05 for both). Subjects with viral DNAemia had lower 
      innate immune function over time compared with those who were virus negative (p < 
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: DNAemia from multiple viruses can be detected in septic children 
      and is strongly associated with preexisting immune suppression and secondary 
      infection risk. The role of DNA viruses in the perpetuation of impaired host defense 
      in this setting should be the subject of prospective study.

AB  - Using metagenomic approaches, we identified a novel Torque teno virus from Brazilian 
      free-tailed bats (Tadarida brasiliensis) (TT-TbV). The TT-TbV genome and deduced 
      protein sequences share extremely low identity with known anelloviruses. Due to a 
      high degree of phylogenetic divergence, such putative virus could not be allocated 
      into any Anelloviridae genera.

TI  - A Novel Subgenotype of Torque teno Virus 1 (TTSuV1) in Slaughter Pigs in China.
AB  - TTsuV1 can cause persistent infection and unidentified clinical signs in pigs. In 
      this study, a survey of TTsuV1 prevalence was conducted in slaughter pigs from 
      Henan, Liaoning, and Shandong provinces in China. A total of 180 swine lymphoid 
      tissues were assayed by PCR with primers targeting the conserved 5'-untranslated 
      region (5'-UTR). The results showed that a 17.8 % positive rate, and different 
      genotypes were detected. TTSuV1 presented higher viral load and prevalence in 
      inguinal lymph node than in submandibular lymph node samples. All TTsuV1 isolates 
      have 84-100 % nucleotide sequence homology in the 5'-UTR region and can be grouped 
      into three subgenotypes (TTsuV1(a-1), TTsuV1(a-2), and TTsuV1(b)). Notably, the 
      novel genetic subtype TTsuV1(b) was first reported in slaughter pigs.

TI  - Epidemiological surveillance of human enteric viruses by monitoring of different 
      environmental matrices.
PG  - 239-44
AB  - In the aim of studying possible relations between viruses detected in clinical 
      specimens and the ones found in different environmental matrices, in the period May 
      2004 to April 2005, the collection of faecal samples from gastroenteritis cases and 
      the monthly monitoring of raw and treated wastewater, river water, seawater and 
      mussels were carried out. The viruses considered for environmental monitoring were 
      adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Torque 
      teno virus (TTV): they were searched for with PCR and RT-PCR and confirmed by gene 
      sequencing. Faecal coliforms and somatic coliphages' counts were also determined. 
      The surveillance of case detected 45 positive faecal samples out of 255 (17.6%) 
      while 35 of 56 environmental samples (62.5%) resulted positive for at least one of 
      the considered viruses. The detection of the same viral strain in the faeces of 
      gastroenteritis cases and in water was possible for adenovirus and rotavirus, which 
      were also predominant in environmental matrices; thus they could be considered as a 
      reference for risk assessment.

TI  - Detection of Torque teno midi virus/Small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) in the sera of 
      domestic village chickens and its vertical transmission from hen to eggs.
PG  - 110-3
AB  - Although the infection of different animals and non-human primates with other 
      members of Anelloviridae have already been reported there is no report about 
      infection of animals with Torque teno midi virus/Small anellovirs (TTMDV/SAV). The 
      aim of this study was to detect the virus in domestic village chickens. Blood 
      samples were collected from 79 domestic village chickens in Isfahan. Blood samples 
      of five adult laying hens and one cockerel were collected in three consecutive weeks 
      (days 1, 8 and 14) as experimental chickens. Ten eggs were randomly collected from 
      the eggs laid during days 12 to 17 and thin and thick egg whites and yolk samples 
      were collected aseptically. After DNA extraction Nested-PCR was performed using 
      SMAs/SMAr primers. In PCR, 431 bp and 441 bp products were detected. The detected 
      bands were extracted and sequenced. Totally 26 out of 79 (32.9%) of the blood 
      samples were positive for the virus. The frequency of the infection of the different 
      parts of the eggs tested was 76%. For the first time TTMDV/SAV was detected in 
      domestic village chickens which also vertically transmitted to eggs.

PG  - 196
LID - 10.1186/s12903-020-01188-2 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesviruses and bacteria and their interplay have long been believed 
      to play important roles in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, but other microbial 
      entities in the oral environment might also be involved. Anelloviruses are commonly 
      detected in human, including in oral samples. The aim of the present study was to 
      explore the occurrence and co-occurrence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), 
      Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human anelloviruses (HTTVs) in gingival tissue samples 
      collected from participants recruited in Shanghai, China. METHODS: Gingival tissues 
      were collected from 159 participants (57 with aggressive periodontitis (AP), 59 with 
      chronic periodontitis (CP) and 43 with healthy periodontal status). The presence of 
      HCMV, EBV, torque teno virus (TTV), torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and torque teno 
      midi virus (TTMDV) DNA was detected by nested-PCR. The virus loads were quantified 
      by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The detection rates of EBV, TTV, TTMV and TTMDV were 
      significantly higher in the AP and CP groups compared to the healthy group (all 
      P < 0.01). A statistically significant association was found between EBV, TTV and 
      TTMV virus load and periodontitis (all P < 0.05). Participants infected with EBV 
      showed significantly higher infection rates and higher virus loads of TTV and TTMV 
      than the EBV-negative group (all P < 0.05). The coexistence rates of EBV and 
      anelloviruses and the coexistence of three HTTVs were significantly higher in AP and 
      CP groups (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results obtained in this study 
      suggest that HTTVs and the coexistence of EBV and HTTVs in particular, may be 
      associated with periodontitis. Possible mechanisms of the interaction between 
      herpesviruses and anelloviruses in the context of periodontitis require further 
      investigation.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are small, ubiquitous, viruses with a highly diverse, 
      single-stranded, negative sense DNA genome and wide host range. They are detected at 
      high rates in both healthy and diseased individuals and are considered a significant 
      part of the mammalian virome. Similar to human TTVs, swine TTVs (TTSuVs) are 
      epidemiologically linked to several coinfections including porcine circovirus types 
      2 and 3 and the porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome virus. 
      Experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with TTSuVs resulted in lesions in 
      multiple organs and exacerbation of coinfections, making TTSuVs the only members of 
      the Anelloviridae family with experimental evidence for pathogenicity. However, due 
      to the lack of reliable cell culture and animal models, mechanistic studies on viral 
      immunity and pathogenesis are limited. The objective of this review is to summarize 
      the current status of knowledge regarding the biology, detection, pathogenesis and 
      public health significance of TTSuVs, while identifying gaps in knowledge which 
      limit the field.

TI  - The Role of Emerging and Neglected Viruses in the Etiology of Hepatitis.
PG  - 51
LID - 10.1007/s11908-019-0709-2 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review, we present the overview of emerging and neglected 
      viruses associated with liver involvement. RECENT FINDINGS: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) 
      emerged in the last two decades, causing hepatitis in many parts of the world. 
      Moreover, liver involvement was also described in some emerging arboviral 
      infections. Many reports showed dengue-associated liver injury; however, 
      chikungunya, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, and Zika virus are rarely 
      associated with clinically manifest liver disease. In addition, some neglected 
      highly prevalent viruses such as adenoviruses and parvovirus B19 are capable of 
      causing hepatitis in specific population groups. Anelloviruses (torque teno 
      virus/torque teno mini virus/torque teno midi virus, SEN virus), human bocavirus, 
      pegiviruses, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus have shown a little potential 
      for causing hepatitis, but their role in the etiology of liver disease remains to be 
      determined. In addition to the well-known hepatotropic viruses, many emerging and 
      neglected viruses have been associated with liver diseases. The number of emerging 
      zoonotic viruses has been increasingly recognized. While zoonotic potential of HEV 
      is well documented, the recent identification of new hepatitis-related animal 
      viruses such as HEV strains from rabbits and camels, non-primate hepaciviruses in 
      domestic dogs and horses, as well as equine and porcine pegivirus highlights the 
      possible zoonotic transmission in the context of "One Health." However, zoonotic 
      potential and hepatotropism of animal hepatitis viruses remain to be determined.

TI  - Torque teno virus viremia in patients with chronic arthritis: Influence of biologic 
      therapies.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a highly prevalent non-pathogenic anellovirus 
      whose plasma levels may be a biomarker of immunosuppression. The aim of this study 
      was to assess whether specific immune-targeting with different biologic drugs may 
      differentially modulate TTV viremia in arthritis patients. METHODS: TTV DNA load was 
      quantified by PCR in a cross-sectional sample of 79 patients with chronic arthritis 
      on biologic therapy (abatacept, infliximab, rituximab or tocilizumab), 31 patients 
      treated with conventional DMARDs (methotrexate and/or leflunomide), and 54 healthy 
      individuals. Longitudinal changes in TTV load were analysed in a second group of 59 
      patients at baseline and 4-months after biologic therapy. Correlations between 
      clinical or biological characteristics of recruited patients and TTV viremia were 
      also analysed. RESULTS: In the cross-sectional study, TTV load was significantly 
      higher in patients who received abatacept, infliximab or tocilizumab compared to 
      healthy individuals. Patients treated with rituximab or conventional DMARDs showed 
      TTV loads similar to healthy controls. In the longitudinal study, an increase in the 
      TTV load was observed after anti-TNF, tocilizumab, abatacept and rituximab, but not 
      after secukinumab therapy. Correlations between TTV load and clinical variables such 
      as disease duration, concomitant glucocorticoid or DMARDs therapy, lymphocytes or 
      previous infections were not found. A non-significant trend towards higher TTV load 
      was observed in therapy responders. CONCLUSION: Patients with chronic arthritis on 
      biologic but not on conventional DMARD or anti-IL17 therapy have increased TTV 
      viremia. This observation provides a basis to prospectively explore the potential 
      value of TTV load as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker.

TI  - State of the art: what we know about infectious agents and myositis.
PG  - 585-94
LID - 10.1097/BOR.0b013e32834b5457 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Increasing evidence suggests that the idiopathic inflammatory 
      myopathies (IIMs) result from certain environmental exposures in genetically 
      susceptible individuals. Investigations have demonstrated that a variety of 
      infections not only cause infectious myopathies but also could be possible triggers 
      for IIM. This review summarizes published studies on the possible roles of 
      infections in inflammatory muscle disease. RECENT FINDINGS: Many infectious agents 
      have been linked to the development of IIMs via case reports, epidemiologic 
      investigations, and animal models. Additional agents possibly involved in triggering 
      the development of IIMs have been recently described, including Torque teno virus 
      (TTV) and Borrelia burgdorferi. Novel animal models of myositis have been recently 
      developed using Leishmania infantum or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). New technologies 
      to assess infectious agents include high-throughput methods for pathogen 
      identification and novel approaches to identify gene expression of pathogens in 
      tissues. SUMMARY: Understanding the causes of IIMs remains limited in part due to 
      the rarity and heterogeneity of these disorders. Although no definitive studies have 
      yet linked infectious agents with IIMs, additional evidence is accumulating and 
      novel technologies may allow improved understanding of the roles of infections in 
      IIMs and for possible future therapeutic and preventive measures.

TI  - Testing for viral contaminants of veterinary vaccines in Hungary.
PG  - 346-9
LID - 10.1016/j.biologicals.2010.01.007 [doi]
AB  - The safety of veterinary vaccines is of paramount importance and it is significantly 
      jeopardised by extraneous agents such as bacteria, mycoplasma, Chlamydia and 
      viruses. Several critical steps of vaccine manufacture involve a potential risk of 
      viral contamination. Viruses, as extraneous, agents can be divided into two main 
      groups. Group 1 agents, such as Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), and egg 
      drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well-known to manufacturers and authorities. 
      Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established 
      to minimise the risk of contamination with these agents. Contrary to group 1, group 
      2 agents like Torque Teno virus (TTV) or RD114, a replication-competent feline 
      gamma-retrovirus, have only recently been recognised and their role as contaminants 
      needs further investigation. Randomly selected veterinary vaccines used between 1992 
      and 2009 were tested by nucleic acid amplification for CAV, EDSV, and TTV. 
      Pestivirus contamination was examined in 33 vaccines used between 1996 and 2006 and 
      a further 27 vaccines used between 2007 and 2009 based on random selection of these 
      vaccines. In addition to random tests done on vaccines used from 2007 on, 12 batches 
      of live Aujeszky's disease vaccines submitted to our laboratory for Official Control 
      Authority Batch Release (OCABR) were also tested for Pestivirus.

LID - 1898
AB  - A new member of Anelloviridae, named torque teno mini virus (TTMV)-SH, was recently 
      identified in the serum of three Hodgkin's lymphoma patients suggesting that TTMV-SH 
      may be associated with this type of hematological malignancy. We investigated by 
      metagenomic analysis the presence of TTMV-SH-related viruses in plasma samples (n = 
      323) collected from patients with various hematological malignancies (multiple 
      myeloma (MM, n = 256), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 20), acute myeloid leukemia 
      (n = 10)) and from healthy donors (n = 37). TTMV-SH-related strains were identified 
      in 24 samples corresponding to four MM and one NHL patients. Phylogenic analysis 
      revealed that the 24 isolates were close to the TTMV-SH strains previously 
      identified, sharing 79.6-86.7% ORF1 nucleotide sequence identity. These results 
      suggest that TTMV-SH-related viruses might be found in hematological diseases other 
      than Hodgkin's lymphoma. Due to the high genetic variability within Anelloviridae 
      species, the association between a particular medical condition and a new genotype 
      should be interpreted with caution.

AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the ocular surface microbiome of healthy volunteers using a 
      combination of microbial culture and high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques. 
      METHODS: Conjunctival swab samples from 107 healthy volunteers were analyzed by 
      bacterial culture, 16S rDNA gene deep sequencing (n = 89), and biome 
      representational in silico karyotyping (BRiSK; n = 80). Swab samples of the facial 
      skin (n = 42), buccal mucosa (n = 50), and environmental controls (n = 27) were 
      processed in parallel. 16S rDNA gene quantitative PCR was used to calculate the 
      bacterial load in each site. Bacteria were characterized by site using principal 
      coordinate analysis of metagenomics data. BRiSK data were analyzed for presence of 
      fungi and viruses. RESULTS: Corynebacteria, Propionibacteria, and coagulase-negative 
      Staphylococci were the predominant organisms identified by all three techniques. 
      Quantitative 16S PCR demonstrated approximately 0.1 bacterial 16S rDNA/human actin 
      copy on the ocular surface compared with greater than 10 16S rDNA/human actin copy 
      for facial skin or the buccal mucosa. The conjunctival bacterial community structure 
      is distinct compared with the facial skin (R = 0.474, analysis of similarities P = 
      0.0001), the buccal mucosa (R = 0.893, P = 0.0001), and environmental control 
      samples (R = 0.536, P = 0.0001). 16S metagenomics revealed substantially more 
      bacterial diversity on the ocular surface than other techniques, which appears to be 
      artifactual. BRiSK revealed presence of torque teno virus (TTV) on the healthy 
      ocular surface, which was confirmed by direct PCR to be present in 65% of all 
      conjunctiva samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: Relative to adjacent skin or other mucosa, 
      healthy ocular surface microbiome is paucibacterial. Its flora are distinct from 
      adjacent skin. Torque teno virus is a frequent constituent of the ocular surface 
      microbiome. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02298881.).

TI  - For timing of HAART is less more? CD4+/CD8+ ratio and CD4+ percentage as surrogate 
      markers for more complex immunological features.
PG  - 75-80
AB  - There is disagreement on the optimal timing of HAART initiation based on absolute 
      CD4+ T-cell count (CD4+ count). We investigated if na�ve patients with CD4+ T-cell 
      percentage (%CD4+) <29% or CD4+/CD8+ ratio <1 display signs of immune deterioration 
      notwithstanding CD4+ count ?500 cells/?l. We found that these patients show B-cell 
      aberrations and an impaired control of Torque Teno Virus replication. By contrast, 
      patients with CD4+?500/?l, %CD4+?29% and CD4+/CD8+?1 displayed features of healthy 
      subjects. Results obtained suggest that a combination of these parameters could be 
      an adequate surrogate marker of immunological competence. This will be helpful in 
      deciding when to start HAART.

TI  - Emerging infectious threats to the blood supply: seroepidemiological studies in iran 
      - a review.
PG  - 210-7
LID - 10.1159/000351540 [doi]
AB  - The risk of transfusion-transmitted infections has been greatly reduced by 
      improvements in donor screening and testing. However, newly recognized blood-borne 
      infectious agents can be threats to blood safety. In order to evaluate the 
      prevalence some of these agents in blood donors, a systematic review was conducted. 
      Data were obtained from published papers related to HGV, Torque Teno virus (TTV), 
      HTLV, West Nile virus (WNV) and SEN virus (SEN-V). Based on these studies, the 
      prevalence of HGV varied from 1 to 8.6% for anti-E2 and from 0 to 4.8% for HGV RNA. 
      The prevalence of TTV DNA and HTLV-I varied from 2.7 to 79.5% and from 0.013 to 
      2.3%, respectively. The WNV-specific IgM antibody and WNV RNA are negative in blood 
      donors. Prevalence rates of SEN-V in Iranian blood donors range from 23 to 90.8%. 
      Consequences of these infectious agents for blood safety are different. Thus, the 
      need to perform laboratory screening as well as effectiveness and efficiency of 
      laboratory tests depend on pathogenicity level and epidemiological conditions of 
      emerging infections. However, being prepared based on the current level of risk and 
      interventions to reduce the risk can be effective in reducing the potential threat 
      for blood supply.

TI  - Unraveling the puzzle of human anellovirus infections by comparison with avian 
      infections with the chicken anemia virus.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1016/j.virusres.2008.06.014 [doi]
AB  - Current clinical studies on human annelloviruses infections are directed towards 
      finding an associated disease. In this review we have emphasized the many 
      similarities between human anellovirus and avian circoviruses and the cell and 
      tissue types infected by these pathogens. We have done this in order to explore 
      whether knowledge acquired from natural and experimental avian infections could 
      reflect and be extrapolated to the less well-characterized human annellovirus 
      infections. The knowledge gained from the avian system may provide suggestions for 
      decoding the enigmatic human anellovirus infections, and finding the specific 
      disease or diseases caused by these human anellovirus infections. Each additional 
      parallelism between chicken anemia virus (CAV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) further 
      strengthens this premise. As we have seen information from human infections can also 
      be used to better understand avian infections as well. Increased attention must be 
      focused on the "hidden" or unrecognized, seemingly asymptomatic effects of 
      circovirus and anellovirus infections. Understanding the facilitating effect of 
      these infections on disease progression caused by other pathogens may help to 
      explain differences in outcome of complicated poultry and human diseases. The final 
      course of a pathogenic infection is determined by variations in the state of health 
      of the host before, during and after contact with a pathogen, in addition to the 
      phenotype of the pathogen and host. The health burden of circoviridae and 
      anellovirus infections may be underestimated, due to lack of awareness of the need 
      to search past the predominant clinical effect of identified pathogens and look for 
      modulation of cellular-based immunity caused by co-infecting circoviruses, and by 
      analogy, human anneloviruses.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Abnormally high levels of T-cell activation can persist in HIV-infected 
      subjects despite effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and has been associated 
      with negative health outcomes. The nature of the antigenic drivers or other causes 
      of this residual T-cell activation remain uncertain. Anelloviruses are universally 
      acquired soon after birth, resulting in persistent viremia, and considered part of 
      the commensal human virome. Reduced immunocompetence results in increased 
      anellovirus levels. OBJECTIVES: To test whether increased levels of anelloviruses or 
      other viruses in plasma are associated with higher levels of persistent T-cell 
      activation during ART. STUDY DESIGN: Two amplification methods combined with next 
      generation sequencing were used to detect all viruses and estimate relative 
      anellovirus levels in plasma from 19 adults on effective ART who exhibited a wide 
      range of T-cell activation levels. RESULTS: Nucleic acids from HBV and HCV were 
      detected in one patient each while pegivirus A (GBV-C) was found in three patients. 
      Anellovirus DNA was detected in all patients with some individuals carrying up to 
      eight different genotypes. Specific anellovirus genotypes or higher level of 
      co-infections were not detected in subjects with higher levels of T-cell activation. 
      No association was detected between relative plasma anellovirus DNA levels and the 
      percentage of activated CD4 or CD8 T cells. CONCLUSIONS: Human anelloviruses were 
      detected in all HIV suppressed subjects, exhibited a wide range of viremia levels, 
      and were genetically highly diverse. The level of persistent T-cell activation was 
      not correlated with the level of viremia or genotypes present indicating that 
      anellovirus antigens are unlikely to be a dominant source of antigens driving 
      chronic T-cell activation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfusion Transmitted Virus (TTV), also known as Torque Teno Virus is 
      a new novel viral agent which appears to correlate with some acute and chronic 
      hepatitis cases and may produce liver damage under specific circumstances. Aim of 
      this study was to detect TT virus by real-time PCR, study its clinical implications 
      and effects of its co-infection in HBV and HCV chronic liver diseases. METHODS: The 
      study population comprised 50 acute hepatitis, 50 chronic hepatitis patients and 100 
      voluntary blood donors. All samples were tested for serum bilirubin, AST, ALT and 
      alkaline phosphatase levels and for all available viral markers for hepatitis. The 
      detection of TT viral genome was carried out by real-time PCR using TTV sequences as 
      reported by Takahashi et al with modifications on the basis of database of the 
      DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (GenBank accession no. AB008394). RESULT: Serum was positive for 
      TTV in 72% of volunteer blood donors, 77.4% (24/31) of hepatitis A cases, 87.6% 
      (36/41) of HBV-positive, 77% (10/13) of HCV-positive, and 92.8% (13/14) of non-B, 
      non-C cases. Co-infection of TTV with other hepatitis viruses was detected in some 
      patients. CONCLUSION: TTV is a frequent virus detected in patients with various 
      types of viral hepatitis, in cases of hepatitis without obvious viral agent, and 
      from the healthy population in India. Rate of TTV was found to be significantly 
      higher (92.8%) for Non A-E hepatitis group.

AB  - Single stranded (ss) DNA viruses are increasingly being discovered due to the 
      ongoing development of modern technologies in exploring the virosphere. 
      Characterized by high rates of recombination and nucleotide substitutions, it could 
      be comparable to RNA virus ones. Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a standard ssDNA 
      virus with a high population diversity, whose evolution is still obscure, further, 
      it is frequently found in co-infections with other viruses threatening the porcine 
      industry and therefore share the same host and epidemiological context. Here, we 
      implement and describe approach to integrate viral nucleotide sequence analysis, 
      surveillance data, and a structural approach to examine the evolution of TTSuVs, we 
      collected samples from pigs displaying respiratory signs in China and revealed a 
      high prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2, frequently as part of co-infections with 
      porcine circoviruses (PCVs), especially in spleen and lung. In addition, thirty six 
      strains sequenced were obtained to investigate their genetic diversity in China. The 
      evolutionary history of TTSuVs were unveiled as following: At the nucleotide 
      sequence level, TTSuVs ORF1 was confirmed to be a robust phylogenetic maker to study 
      evolution comparably to full genomes. Additionally, extensive recombination 
      discovered within TTSuVk2a (also 5 out of the 36 sequenced strains in this study 
      revealed to be recombination). Then, pairwise distance, phylogenetic trees, and 
      amino acid analysis confirmed TTSuVs species, and allowed to define circulating 
      genotypes (TTSuV1a-1, 1a-2, 1b-1, 1b-2, 1b-3, and k2a-1, k2a-2, k2b). Selection 
      analysis uncovered seven and six positive selected sites in TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2, 
      respectively. At the protein structure level, mapping of sites onto the 
      three-dimensional structure revealed that several positive selected sites locate 
      into potential epitopes, which might related to the potential escaping from host 
      immune response. Our result could assist future studies on swine ssDNA virus 
      classification, surveillance and control.

AB  - At least 12% of human cancers are caused by virus infection. To understand whether 
      other viruses are associated with human cancers, a viral metagenomics approach was 
      used to analyze the composition of the viral communities of the serum of the 
      patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this report, a 
      human anellovirus TTMV named TTMV-SH was discovered from three patients with HL. The 
      complete genome of TTMV-SH is 2812nt in length. Phylogenetic analysis based on ORF1 
      indicated that TTMV-SH of the 11 isolates cluster with TTMV strain TLMV-CBD231 
      sharing only 60.3-62% sequence similarity, and the sequences divergence is 
      41.5-43.1%, which indicates that TTMV-SH is a novel species. The TTMV-SH prevalence 
      in HL group, especially in nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphomas (NSHL), was 
      significantly higher than in the healthy group implicated that the TTMV-SH may be 
      associated with HL, especially NSHL.

AB  - Acute encephalitis/encephalopathy is a severe neurological syndrome that is 
      occasionally associated with viral infection. Comprehensive virus detection assays 
      are desirable because viral pathogens have not been identified in many cases. We 
      evaluated the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detecting viruses in 
      clinical samples of encephalitis/encephalopathy patients. We first determined the 
      sensitivity and quantitative performance of NGS by comparing the NGS-determined 
      number of sequences of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) in clinical serum samples with 
      the HHV-6 load measured using real-time PCR. HHV-6 was measured as it occasionally 
      causes neurologic disorders in children. The sensitivity of NGS for detection of 
      HHV-6 sequences was equivalent to that of real-time PCR, and the number of HHV-6 
      reads was significantly correlated with HHV-6 load. Next, we investigated the 
      ability of NGS to detect viral sequences in 18 pediatric patients with acute 
      encephalitis/encephalopathy of unknown etiology. A large number of Coxsackievirus A9 
      and mumps viral sequences were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 2 and 1 
      patients, respectively. In addition, Torque teno virus and Pepper mild mottle viral 
      sequences were detected in the sera of one patient each. These data indicate that 
      NGS is useful for detection of causative viruses in patients with pediatric 
      encephalitis/encephalopathy.

AB  - The imprints left by persistent DNA viruses in the tissues can testify to the 
      changes driving virus evolution as well as provide clues on the provenance of modern 
      and ancient humans. However, the history hidden in skeletal remains is practically 
      unknown, as only parvovirus B19 and hepatitis B virus DNA have been detected in hard 
      tissues so far. Here, we investigated the DNA prevalences of 38 viruses in femoral 
      bone of recently deceased individuals. To this end, we used quantitative PCRs and a 
      custom viral targeted enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing. The data 
      was analyzed with a tailor-made bioinformatics pipeline. Our findings revealed bone 
      to be a much richer source of persistent DNA viruses than earlier perceived, 
      discovering ten additional ones, including several members of the herpes- and 
      polyomavirus families, as well as human papillomavirus 31 and torque teno virus. 
      Remarkably, many of the viruses found have oncogenic potential and/or may reactivate 
      in the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals. Thus, their persistence warrants 
      careful evaluation of their clinical significance and impact on bone biology. Our 
      findings open new frontiers for the study of virus evolution from ancient relics as 
      well as provide new tools for the investigation of human skeletal remains in 
      forensic and archaeological contexts.

AB  - Swine effluents must be correctly handled to avoid negative environmental impacts. 
      In this study, the profiles of two swine manure treatment systems were evaluated: a 
      solid-liquid separation step, followed by an anaerobic reactor, and an aerobic step 
      (System 1); and a biodigester followed by serial lagoons (System 2). Both systems 
      were described by the assessment of chemical, bacterial and viral parameters. The 
      results showed that in System 1, there was reduction of chemicals (COD, phosphorus, 
      total Kjeldhal nitrogen - TKN - and NH(3)), total coliforms and Escherichia coli; 
      however, the same reduction was not observed for Salmonella sp. Viral particles were 
      significantly reduced but not totally eliminated from the effluent. In System 2, 
      there was a reduction of chemicals, bacteria and viruses with no detection of 
      Salmonella sp., circovirus, parvovirus, and torque teno virus in the effluent. The 
      chemical results indicate that the treated effluent can be reused for cleaning swine 
      facilities. However, the microbiological results show a need of additional treatment 
      to achieve a complete inactivation for cases when direct contact with animals is 
      required.

TI  - Metagenomic Next-Generation Sequencing Reveals Individual Composition and Dynamics 
      of Anelloviruses during Autologous Stem Cell Transplant Recipient Management.
LID - 10.3390/v10110633 [doi]
LID - 633
AB  - Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of the 
      anelloviruses, the major component of the human virome, for the prediction of 
      post-transplant complications such as severe infections. Due to an important 
      diversity, the comprehensive characterization of this viral family over time has 
      been poorly studied. To overcome this challenge, we used a metagenomic 
      next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach with the aim of determining the 
      individual anellovirus profile of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) patients. 
      We conducted a prospective pilot study on a homogeneous patient cohort regarding the 
      chemotherapy regimens that included 10 ASCT recipients. A validated viral mNGS 
      workflow was used on 108 plasma samples collected at 11 time points from diagnosis 
      to 90 days post-transplantation. A complex interindividual variability in terms of 
      abundance and composition was noticed. In particular, a strong sex effect was found 
      and confirmed using quantitative PCR targeting torque teno virus, the most abundant 
      anellovirus. Interestingly, an important turnover in the anellovirus composition was 
      observed during the course of the disease revealing a strong intra-individual 
      variability. Although more studies are needed to better understand anellovirus 
      dynamics, these findings are of prime importance for their future use as biomarkers 
      of immune competence.

TI  - The emergence of porcine circovirus 2b genotype (PCV-2b) in swine in Canada.
PG  - 811-9
AB  - Since late 2004, the swine industry in the province of Quebec has experienced a 
      significant increase in death rate related to postweaning multisystemic wasting 
      syndrome (PMWS). To explain this phenomenon, 2 hypotheses were formulated: 1) the 
      presence of a 2nd pathogen could be exacerbating the porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) 
      infection, or 2) a new and more virulent PCV-2 strain could be infecting swine. In 
      2005, 13 PMWS cases were submitted to the Quebec provincial diagnostic laboratory 
      and PCV-2 was the only virus that could be found consistently by PCR in all 13 
      samples. The PCR detection results obtained for other viruses revealed the 
      following: 61.5% were positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome 
      virus, 30.8% for swine influenza virus, 15.4% for porcine parvovirus, 69.2% for 
      swine torque teno virus (swTTV), 38.5% for swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) and 84.6% 
      for Mycoplasma hyorhinis; transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine 
      respiratory coronavirus (TGEV/PRCV) was not detected. Sequences of the entire genome 
      revealed that these PCV-2 strains belonged to a genotype (named PCV-2b) that has 
      never been reported in Canada. Further sequence analyses on 83 other Canadian PCV-2 
      positive cases submitted to the provincial diagnostic laboratory during years 2005 
      and 2006 showed that 79.5% of the viral sequences obtained clustered in the PCV-2b 
      genotype. The appearance of the PCV-2b genotype in Canada may explain the death rate 
      increase related to PMWS, but this relationship has to be confirmed.

TI  - Identification of novel anelloviruses with broad diversity in UK rodents.
PG  - 1544-1553
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.065219-0 [doi]
AB  - Anelloviruses are a family of small circular ssDNA viruses with a vast genetic 
      diversity. Human infections with the prototype anellovirus, torque teno virus (TTV), 
      are ubiquitous and related viruses have been described in a number of other 
      mammalian hosts. Despite over 15 years of investigation, there is still little known 
      about the pathogenesis and possible disease associations of anellovirus infections, 
      arising in part due to the lack of a robust cell culture system for viral 
      replication or tractable small-animal model. We report the identification of diverse 
      anelloviruses in several species of wild rodents. The viruses are highly prevalent 
      in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and field voles (Microtus agrestis), detectable 
      at a low frequency in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), but absent from house mice (Mus 
      musculus). The viruses identified have a genomic organization consistent with other 
      anelloviruses, but form two clear phylogenetic groups that are as distinct from each 
      other as from defined genera.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) 
      could be experimentally induced in gnotobiotic swine. SAMPLE POPULATION: Plasma 
      samples from 27 sows and 20 conventional weaned piglets were obtained, and 30 
      gnotobiotic pigs were used in experiments. PROCEDURES: 3 experiments were conducted. 
      Groups of 3-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with pooled plasma samples 
      obtained from healthy feeder pigs in a herd that was in the initial phases of an 
      outbreak of respiratory disease; gross and histologic lesions of PDNS were detected 
      in the inoculated pigs. In a second experiment, 2- and 3-day-old gnotobiotic pigs 
      were inoculated with porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and 
      with PRRSV-negative tissue homogenate containing genogroup 1 torque teno virus 
      (g1-TTV). Lesions of PDNS were detected. RESULTS: Pigs inoculated with pooled plasma 
      or the combination of tissue-culture-origin PRRSV and g1-TTV tissue homogenate 
      developed systemic hemostatic defects, bilaterally symmetric cutaneous hemorrhages, 
      generalized edema, icterus, bilaterally symmetric renal cortical hemorrhage, dermal 
      vasculitis with hemorrhage, and interstitial pneumonia consistent with a clinical 
      and pathologic diagnosis of PDNS. The PRRSV RNAs and g1-TTV DNAs were detected in 
      plasma; all pigs seroconverted to PRRSV, and all had negative results for porcine 
      circovirus type 2 when tested by use of PCR assays. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL 
      RELEVANCE: These data suggested that PDNS is a manifestation of disseminated 
      intravascular coagulation in swine. For the experimental conditions reported here, 
      combined infection with g1-TTV and PRRSV was implicated in the genesis of these 
      lesions.

AB  - Microbiological safety of reclaimed water is one of the most important issues in 
      managing potential health risks related to wastewater recycling. Presence and 
      removal of human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), human torque teno 
      virus (HTtV) and somatic coliphage family Microviridae in three wastewater treatment 
      plants (WWTP) in sub-tropical Brisbane, Australia was investigated. All three WWTPs 
      employ activated sludge process with added on Bardenpho process for nutrient 
      removal. HPyV, HAdV, HTtV and Microviridae were consistently detected in the 
      influent (10(5) to 10(6) Genomic copies (GC) L(-1)) and secondary treated effluent 
      (10(2) to 10(3)GCL(-)(1)). The results of this study suggest that, under appropriate 
      conditions, WWTPs with activated sludge process in sub-tropical climate could be an 
      effective treatment barrier with >3 log(10) removal of enteric virus. The geometric 
      mean of pooled data for each virus from all sites showed the highest removal for 
      HPyV (3.65 log(10)) and lowest for HAdV (2.79 log(10)) which was statistically 
      significant (p=0.00001). Whereas, the removal rate of HTtV and Microviridae was 
      identical (2.81 log(10)). A poor correlation between the presence of enteric virus 
      in influent or effluent with routinely monitored physicochemical parameters suggests 
      limited use of physicochemical parameters as predictors of enteric virus presence. 
      High prevalence of HAdV in influent and effluent combined with comparatively low 
      removal suggest that it could be used as a model microorganism for determining 
      enteric virus removal efficacy. Additional tertiary treatment may be required prior 
      to effluent reuse for non-potable purposes or discharge into the recreational waters 
      to prevent exposure of people to health hazards.

TI  - Virus occupational exposure in solid waste processing facilities.
PG  - 1115-27
LID - 10.1093/annhyg/met043 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that workers involved in the management of solid waste are at risk 
      of exposure to bioaerosol, which is generally studied in relation to bacteria, 
      fungi, and endotoxins. However, to date, there have been no reports on the incidence 
      of work-related infectious diseases. To determine if occupational exposure to 
      viruses occurs upon exposure to waste-related activities, monitoring was carried out 
      in a landfill, a waste recycling plant, an incineration plant, and a waste 
      collection vehicles. Air and surfaces were sampled and analyzed for torque teno 
      virus (TTV), human adenovirus (HAdV), norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus using 
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. Positivity was confirmed by 
      sequencing and quantification with real-time PCR; infectivity was also tested for 
      culturable viruses. Samples were analyzed in parallel for mean total bacterial and 
      fungi counts in both the summer and winter. In total, 30% (12/40) of air and 13.5% 
      (5/37) of surface samples collected in plants were positive for HAdV and TTV. Among 
      the eight HAdV-positive samples, six (75%), revealed in landfill and recycling plant 
      air and in incinerator and waste vehicles surfaces, were able to replicate in cell 
      culture and were subsequently confirmed as infective. The frequency of detection of 
      virus-positive samples was similar in both seasons, but with evident differences in 
      the type of virus detected: TTV and HAdV were more frequently detected in the summer 
      and winter, respectively. The area of highest viral contamination was the paper 
      selection landfill. Fungi and bacterial contamination did not correlate with viral 
      presence or concentration. In conclusion, we evidence that working with solid and 
      liquid waste can lead to infectious viruses, included in Group 2 of the European 
      Directive 90/679/CEE pathogens list; thus, further investigation on the sources and 
      routes of contamination is needed in order to assess the occupational risk.

TI  - Molecular Epidemiology of Anellovirus Infection in Children's Urine: A 
      Cross-sectional Study.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.4103/abr.abr_169_19 [doi]
LID - 16
AB  - BACKGROUND: Anelloviridae is a viral family which is considered as a constant 
      component of human virome. Given the ubiquitous nature of the virus infection and 
      the long-standing relationship between the virus and the host, in the present study, 
      we aimed at investigating the presence of Anelloviruses in the urine samples of 
      children in a cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The urine samples of 50 
      children who were referred to Hazrat Ali Asghar Children's Hospital, affiliated to 
      Iran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, were obtained. Three TaqMan 
      real-time polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were carried out for Anellovirus 
      detection. A phylogenetic tree was drawn for positive products after PCR 
      amplification, purification, and nucleotide sequencing. SPSS, version 20, was used 
      for statistical analyses. RESULTS: Children's mean age ± standard deviation was 4.30 
      ± 1.47 years and 56% (28/50) were female. Real-time PCR revealed that Anellovirus 
      was positive in 12% (6/50). Furthermore, PCR-sequencing results showed that torque 
      teno virus was detected in 83.3% (5/6) and SEN virus in 16.6% (1/6) of the 
      Anellovirus positive samples. In addition, 86% (5/6) of the children with positive 
      samples were female. No significant difference was detected between any of the 
      demographic characteristics and Anellovirus positivity (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: 
      According to our preliminary study, the presence of Anelloviruses in the urine 
      samples of asymptomatic children in Iran is striking, although limited sample size 
      and age range limitations might have affected the comprehensive results of our 
      study.

AB  - In the present study, Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) were detected in tissue and 
      blood samples obtained from domestic pigs in central China, and complete genomes of 
      TTSuVs were characterized. A total of three tissue samples (3/20, 15 %) from 
      post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected pigs and 30 blood samples 
      (30/40, 75 %) from healthy pigs were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) 
      and/or 2 (TTSuV2). Two TTSuV strains (TTV1Hn54 and TTV2Hn93) comprising 2,794 and 
      2,875 nucleotides, respectively, each had four open reading frames (ORFs) and the 
      untranslated region with TATA box and GC-rich region. Genomic sequence of TTV2Hn93 
      strain was unique in length compared with other TTSuV2 genomic sequences. 
      Interestingly, three rolling-circle replication (RCR) motif-IIIs (YXXK) which were 
      located at amino acid (aa) position 166-169, 328-331, and 379-382, respectively, 
      were found in the ORF1 of TTV1Hn54. Two RCR motif-IIIs (YXXK) at the aa position 
      105-108 and 480-483 respectively, were also identified in the ORF1 of TTV2Hn93. 
      Phylogenetic tree based on complete genomes showed that TTV1Hn54 strain was 
      designated into type TTSuV1b and had a slight high sequence identity of 91 % with 
      the Canada strain (JQ120664). TTV2Hn93 strain was classified into subtype TTSuV2d 
      and shared the highest identity (97 %) with the Spain strain (GU570207).

TI  - Disease risks associated with free-ranging wild boar in Saskatchewan.
PG  - 839-44
AB  - This study investigated the disease status of Saskatchewan's feral wild boar 
      population. Whole carcasses, tissue samples, and/or serum from 81 hunter-killed 
      boars from Saskatchewan were submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative 
      (CWHC) between 2009 and 2014. Serological tests were negative for PRRS, H1N1, and 
      H3N2 swine influenza, PCV-2, and TGE/PRCV in 22/22 boars and for Toxoplasma gondii 
      and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 20/20 boars. Of 20 boars whose sera were tested 20 
      were positive for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, with 7 positive for, among other 
      strains, serotype 14; 16 were positive for Lawsonia intracellularis, 1 was positive 
      and 6 were suspicious for Salmonella spp. Polymerase chain reaction tests were 
      negative for PRRS and PCV2 in 58/58 boars and positive for Torque teno virus in 1/8 
      boars. Digestion assays were negative for Trichinella spp. in 22/22 boars. The high 
      seroprevalence of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 14 is noteworthy as this serotype has 
      not been previously reported in North America.

TI  - Torque teno virus for risk stratification of graft rejection and infection in kidney 
      transplant recipients-A prospective observational trial.
PG  - 2081-2090
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15810 [doi]
AB  - The nonpathogenic and ubiquitous torque teno virus (TTV) is associated with 
      immunosuppression in solid organ transplant recipients. Studies in kidney transplant 
      patients proposed TTV quantification for risk stratification of graft rejection and 
      infection. In this prospective trial (DRKS00012335) 386 consecutive kidney 
      transplant recipients were subjected to longitudinal per-protocol monitoring of 
      plasma TTV load by polymerase chain reaction for 12 months posttransplant. TTV load 
      peaked at the end of month 3 posttransplant and reached steady state thereafter. TTV 
      load after the end of month 3 was analyzed in the context of subsequent rejection 
      diagnosed by indication biopsy and infection within the first year posttransplant, 
      respectively. Each log increase in TTV load decreased the odds for rejection by 22% 
      (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.97; P = .027) and 
      increased the odds for infection by 11% (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.15; P < .001). TTV 
      was quantified at a median of 14 days before rejection was diagnosed and 27 days 
      before onset of infection, respectively. We defined a TTV load between 1 × 10(6) and 
      1 × 10(8) copies/mL as optimal range to minimize the risk for rejection and 
      infection. These data support the initiation of an interventional trial assessing 
      the efficacy of TTV-guided immunosuppression to reduce infection and graft rejection 
      in kidney transplant recipients.

AB  - Because broad genetic diversity has recently been detected in Torque teno sus 
      viruses (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), the viral genome detection method needs to be improved 
      to understand the prevalence of these viruses. Here, we established single PCR-based 
      detection methods for the TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a genomes with newly designed primer 
      pairs and applied them to investigate the prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a in 
      Japanese pig populations. The results revealed that 98.2% and 81.7% of the pig farms 
      tested positive for the TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a genomes, respectively, indicating that 
      both TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a are widespread in Japan.

TI  - Possible risks posed by single-stranded DNA viruses of pigs associated with 
      xenotransplantation.
PG  - e12453
LID - 10.1111/xen.12453 [doi]
LID - e12453
AB  - Routine large-scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is getting closer to 
      clinical reality owing to several state-of-the-art technologies, especially the 
      ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, using pig organs in 
      humans poses risks including unwanted cross-species transfer of viruses and adaption 
      of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field 
      of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire 
      viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. 
      Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome 
      studies in mammals. Specifically, the ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a 
      high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new 
      hosts and cross-species barriers. Pig-associated ssDNA viruses include torque teno 
      sus viruses (TTSuV) in the Anelloviridae family, porcine parvoviruses (PPV), and 
      porcine bocaviruses (PBoV) both in the family of Parvoviridae, and porcine 
      circoviruses (PCV) in the Circoviridae family, some of which have been confirmed to 
      be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during 
      xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge 
      available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig-associated ssDNA 
      viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive 
      identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in 
      xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed.

AB  - Solid waste storage in specially designated areas - landfills - has been the basic 
      method of municipal solid waste disposal management for many years. However, thermal 
      treatment is the currently preferred method of solid waste disposal. Hygienic 
      assessment of working conditions in municipal waste incineration plants is hindered 
      due to the variability and complexity of pollutants emitted during the combustion 
      process. For many years studies describing this problem have focused mainly on 
      chemical pollution inside the plants as well as emitted into the atmosphere. 
      Available data indicates the presence of organic dust at workplaces in the range 
      0.1-14 mg/m<sup>3</sup>. It has been proven that it is a carrier of a wide spectrum 
      of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and both mesophilic and thermophilic 
      actinomycetes as well as adenoviruses and torque teno virus (TTV). In the air, at 
      workplaces, bacterial endotoxins have also been found in concentrations reaching 
      even 50 000 EU/m<sup>3</sup>, which may significantly affect the occurrence of 
      pro-inflammatory reactions in the lungs as well as toxic pneumonitis. Biological 
      agents should be taken into account in the occupational risk assessment for harmful 
      agents present in this environment, and an in-depth characterization of exposure and 
      health effects resulting from contact with these agents should be continued to an 
      even greater extent than before. Med Pr. 2019;70(1):99-105.

TI  - Snatch-farrowed, porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pigs as a model for swine 
      infectious disease research.
PG  - 81-8
AB  - The current study tested the benefit of commercially available spray-dried bovine 
      colostrum (The Saskatoon Colostrum Company, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) in raising 
      snatch-farrowed, porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pigs. In experiment 1, 12 
      SF-pCD pigs received a liquid diet composed mainly of bovine colostrum from birth to 
      day 10; 6 remained on the same liquid diet (COL), and the other 6 were fed a diet 
      composed mainly of milk replacer (RPL) until weaning. In experiment 2, 12 SF-pCD 
      pigs were fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning; after weaning, 6 were fed a 
      starter diet containing 20% (w/w) bovine colostrum powder (STARTER-COL), and the 
      other 6 were fed a starter diet without any bovine colostrum (STARTER-CTRL) until 
      termination (day 42 or day 49). In experiment 1 the COL pigs had significantly fewer 
      fever-days than did the RPL pigs. In experiment 2 diarrhea, typhlocolitis, and 
      pancreatic degeneration developed in 4 of the STARTER-COL pigs after weaning. In 
      both experiments all the pigs fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning survived 
      until termination. All pigs tested free of swine influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2, 
      Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Porcine parvovirus. In 
      experiment 2 all the pigs tested free of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), but some 
      in both groups tested positive for Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2. In 
      conclusion, with the use of snatch-farrowing and bovine colostrum, pigs can be 
      raised in the absence of porcine maternal antibodies with 100% survival and freedom 
      from most porcine pathogens of biologic relevance. This model is potentially 
      suitable for animal disease research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rare and severe syndrome that 
      frequently requires liver transplantation. Viruses are one of the most frequent 
      causes of this disease, however, pathogenic viruses are not determined in many 
      patients. Recently next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied to 
      comprehensively detect pathogens of infectious diseases of unknown etiology. 
      OBJECTIVES: To evaluate an NGS-based approach for detecting pathogenic viruses in 
      patients with PALF or acute hepatitis of unknown etiology. STUDY DESIGN: To detect 
      virus-derived DNA and RNA sequences existing in sera/plasma from patients, both DNA 
      and RNA sequencing were performed. First, we validated the ability of NGS to detect 
      viral pathogens in clinical serum/plasma samples, and compared different commercial 
      RNA library preparation methods Then, serum/plasma of fourteen patients with PALF or 
      acute hepatitis of unknown etiology were evaluated using NGS. RESULTS: Among three 
      RNA library preparation methods, Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 had the highest 
      sensitivity to detect RNA viral sequences. Among fourteen patients, sequence reads 
      of torque teno virus, adeno-associated virus, and stealth virus were found in the 
      sera of one patient each, however, the pathophysiological role of these three 
      viruses was not clarified. Significant virus reads were not detected in the 
      remaining 11 patients. CONCLUSIONS: This finding might be due to low virus titer in 
      blood at the time of referral or a non-infectious cause might be more frequent. 
      These results suggest an NGS-based approach has potential to detect viral pathogens 
      in clinical samples and would contribute to clarification of the etiology of PALF.

AB  - We conducted an unbiased metagenomics survey using plasma from patients with chronic 
      hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), non-alcoholic 
      steatohepatitis (NASH), and patients without liver disease (control). RNA and DNA 
      libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to 
      catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage 
      in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of 
      sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a 
      patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple 
      sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in 
      plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high 
      frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification 
      of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 
      76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds 
      along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by 
      BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a 
      heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins 
      with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel 
      circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling 
      nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these 
      alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed 
      inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This 
      suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, 
      especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. 
      Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of 
      viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, 
      bile, saliva and other body fluids.

TI  - Spliced mRNAs detected during the life cycle of Chicken anemia virus.
PG  - 2227-2233
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.81946-0 [doi]
AB  - The existence of spliced mRNA in Chicken anemia virus (CAV) was investigated, as 
      three proteins appeared to be derived from a single 2.0 kb mRNA species. Human 
      Torque teno virus (TTV), which displays a number of genomic similarities to CAV, is 
      known to transcribe three mRNA species, suggesting that CAV may also have multiple 
      mRNAs. Northern analysis of infected chicken MDCC-MSB1 cells revealed a 2.0 kb mRNA 
      3 h post-infection (p.i.) and additional 1.6, 1.3 and 1.2 kb bands visible at 48 and 
      72 h p.i. MDCC-MSB1 or COS1 cells transfected with a CAV clone showed similar 
      results. The poly(A)+ RNA of infected cells was subjected to RT-PCR using a suite of 
      CAV-specific primers. The major 2.0 kb RNA reacted with every primer, but the 1.3 
      and 1.2 kb RNAs only annealed to certain primers. The 2.0 kb mRNA had no deletions 
      or mutations and was capable of encoding all three known CAV proteins. The 1.3 kb 
      RNA had a splice site joining nt 1222 to nt 1814 and encoded head/tail viral protein 
      1 (VP1) without a frameshift. In addition, the 1.2 kb RNA possessed a splice site 
      joining nt 994 to nt 1095 and encoded several putative, novel proteins with 
      frameshift mutations. These splice sites conformed to the previously described GT-AG 
      splicing rule. One further 0.8 kb RNA species appeared to be derived from a 
      homologous recombination event. Discovery of the presence of spliced mRNA in CAV 
      strengthens the similarity between CAV and TTV.

TI  - Torque Teno Midi Virus/Small Anellovirus in Sera of Healthy, HIV/HCV and HIV 
      Infected Individuals in Lorestan Province, Iran.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Torque Teno Midi Virus/Small Anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the 
      Gammatorquevirus genus within the family Anelloviridae. It is detected in healthy, 
      Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus and HIV infected individuals and also patients 
      with acute respiratory disease in different countries, but its role in clinical 
      diseases and its full geographical distribution is still unclear. OBJECTIVES: The 
      current study aimed to detect the frequency of infection with TTMDV/SAV in the sera 
      of healthy blood donors, hepatitis C infected and HIV positive individuals in 
      Lorestan province, Iran; and also investigate the possible role of TTMDV/SAV virus 
      in liver diseases. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty two, 36, 4, and 110 serum samples 
      from HIV positive, patients with HIV/HCV and HIV/HCV/HBV co-infections, and healthy 
      individuals were collected in Khorramabad city, respectively. Nested-polymerase 
      chain reaction was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers to detect TTMDV/SAV DNA. Serum 
      aminotransferases were measured. RESULTS: In the HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HIV, and 
      control cases, 29 (80.5%), 3 (75%), 43 (82.7%), and 16 (14.5%) were positive for DNA 
      of TTMDV/SAV, respectively. In the HIV/HCV infected cases and HIV positive cases the 
      level of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were 
      not significantly different in TTMDV/SAV infected and non-infected individuals (P > 
      0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Although significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed in the 
      frequency of TTMDV/SAV between healthy controls and each of the HIV positive and 
      HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, no significant difference was observed between HIV 
      positive and HIV/HCV co-infected cases, which may be due to HIV associated 
      immunodeficiency. This is the first time that TTMDV/SAV is reported in HIV infected 
      individuals worldwide. Interpretation of the high frequency of the virus (82.7%) in 
      HIV cases needs more detailed studies.

TI  - Rescue of a porcine anellovirus (torque teno sus virus 2) from cloned genomic DNA in 
      pigs.

AB  - Anelloviruses are a group of single-stranded circular DNA viruses infecting humans 
      and other animal species. Animal models combined with reverse genetic systems of 
      anellovirus have not been developed. We report here the construction and initial 
      characterization of full-length DNA clones of a porcine anellovirus, torque teno sus 
      virus 2 (TTSuV2), in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that five cell lines, 
      including PK-15 cells, are free of TTSuV1 or TTSuV2 contamination, as determined by 
      a real-time PCR and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-TTSuV antibodies. 
      Recombinant plasmids harboring monomeric or tandem-dimerized genomic DNA of TTSuV2 
      from the United States and Germany were constructed. Circular TTSuV2 genomic DNA 
      with or without introduced genetic markers and tandem-dimerized TTSuV2 plasmids were 
      transfected into PK-15 cells, respectively. Splicing of viral mRNAs was identified 
      in transfected cells. Expression of TTSuV2-specific open reading frame 1 (ORF1) in 
      cell nuclei, especially in nucleoli, was detected by IFA. However, evidence of 
      productive TTSuV2 infection was not observed in 12 different cell lines transfected 
      with the TTSuV2 DNA clones. Transfection with circular DNA from a TTSuV2 deletion 
      mutant did not produce ORF1 protein, suggesting that the observed ORF1 expression is 
      driven by TTSuV2 DNA replication in cells. Pigs inoculated with either the 
      tandem-dimerized clones or circular genomic DNA of U.S. TTSuV2 developed viremia, 
      and the introduced genetic markers were retained in viral DNA recovered from the 
      sera of infected pigs. The availability of an infectious DNA clone of TTSuV2 will 
      facilitate future study of porcine anellovirus pathogenesis and biology.

TI  - Identification of potential pathogenic viruses in patients with acute myocarditis 
      using next-generation sequencing.
PG  - 1814-1821
LID - 10.1002/jmv.25263 [doi]
AB  - Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium and leads to cardiac 
      dysfunction and heart failure. Although viral infections are considered to be the 
      most common etiology of myocarditis, the identification of the causative virus is 
      still challenging. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied in 
      the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The aim of the current study was to 
      comprehensively analyze potential pathogenic microorganisms using NGS in the sera of 
      patients with myocarditis. Twelve pediatric and five adult patients hospitalized for 
      acute myocarditis were included. Serum samples in the acute phase were obtained and 
      analyzed using NGS to detect pathogen-derived DNA and RNA. Viral sequence reads were 
      detected in 7 (41%) of the 17 myocarditis patients by NGS. Among these patients, 
      detection of Epstein-Barr virus, human parvovirus B19, torque teno virus, and 
      respiratory syncytial virus reads by NGS was consistent with polymerase chain 
      reaction or antigen test results in one patient each. A large number of human 
      pegivirus reads were detected from one patient by RNA sequencing; however, its 
      pathogenicity to human is unknown. Conversely, the number of detected virus-derived 
      reads was small in most cases, and the pathophysiological role of these viruses 
      remains to be clarified. No significant bacterial or fungal reads other than normal 
      bacterial flora was detected. These data indicate that comprehensive detection of 
      virus-derived DNA and RNA using NGS can be useful for the identification of 
      potential pathogenic viruses in myocarditis.

LID - 6341015
AB  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1a/TTSuV1b) infection is present in pig herds 
      worldwide. This study investigated the prevalence of TTSuV1a/TTSuV1b infections in 
      domestic pigs from some slaughterhouses in Nigeria as well as coinfection with 
      African swine fever virus (ASFV) and described the phylogeny in relation to global 
      strains. One hundred and eighty-one (181) blood samples from four slaughterhouses 
      were used for the study and viral nucleic acid detection was carried out by PCR. 
      Comparative sequence analysis was carried out to infer phylogeny. The overall 
      prevalence of TTSuV1a/b was 17.7%. Prevalence of individual genotypes was 10.5% and 
      7.2% for TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b, respectively. Coinfection of ASFV/TTSuV1a/b was 7.7% 
      while that of TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b was 1.7%. ASFV alone was detected in 11.91% of the 
      total samples. The Nigerian TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b shared a sequence identity of 
      91-100% and 95-100%, respectively, among each other. The ASFV sequences were 100% 
      identical to members of genotype 1. This is the first report on the presence of 
      TTSuV1a/b in domestic pigs in Nigeria and coinfection with ASFV. Although the 
      prevalence of TTSuV1a/b in Nigeria was low, we recommend further studies to 
      establish the trend and possible role in the pathogenesis of ASFV.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Human-resident microbes can influence both health and disease. 
      Investigating the microbiome using next-generation sequencing technology has 
      revealed examples of mutualism and conflict between microbes and humans. Comparing 
      to bacteria, the viral component of the microbiome (i.e., the "virome") is 
      understudied. Somatic tissues of healthy individuals are usually inaccessible for 
      the virome sampling; therefore, there is limited understanding of the presence and 
      distribution of viruses in tissues in healthy individuals and how virus infection 
      associates with human gene expression and perturbs immunological homeostasis. 
      RESULTS: To characterize the human virome in a tissue-specific manner, here we 
      performed meta-transcriptomic analysis using the RNA-sequencing dataset from the 
      Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We analyzed the 8991 RNA-sequencing data 
      obtained from 51 somatic tissues from 547 individuals and successfully detected 39 
      viral species in at least one tissue. We then investigated associations between 
      virus infection and human gene expression and human disease onset. We detected some 
      expected relationships; for instance, hepatitis C virus infection in the liver was 
      strongly associated with interferon-stimulated gene upregulation and pathological 
      findings of chronic hepatitis. The presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 in one 
      subject's brain strongly associated with immune gene expression. While torque teno 
      virus was detected in a broad range of human tissues, it was not associated with 
      interferon responses. Being notable in light of its association with 
      lymphoproliferative disorders, Epstein-Barr virus infection in the spleen and blood 
      was associated with an increase in plasma cells in healthy subjects. Human 
      herpesvirus 7 was often detected in the stomach; intriguingly, it associated with 
      the proportion of human leukocytes in the stomach as well as digestive gene 
      expression. Moreover, virus infections in the local tissues associated with systemic 
      immune responses in circulating blood. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is 
      the first comprehensive investigation of the human virome in a variety of tissues in 
      healthy individuals through meta-transcriptomic analysis. Further investigation of 
      the associations described here, and application of this analytical pipeline to 
      additional datasets, will be useful to reveal the impact of viral infections on 
      human health.

TI  - Nucleic Acid-Based Screening of Maternal Serum to Detect Viruses in Women with Labor 
      or PROM.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether timing of the initiating event of 
      spontaneous labor (either uterine contractions with intact fetal membranes or 
      rupture of membranes prior to labor (PROM)) is associated with maternal viral 
      infection. It was a prospective case control study of women with either spontaneous 
      labor or PROM occurring < 37 weeks' gestation ("cases") or at term ("controls"). An 
      initial unbiased screen for viruses was performed with next-generation sequencing 
      (NGS) in serum pooled from eight cases delivered by C/S and represents a range of 
      gestational ages, membrane rupture status, and presence or absence of 
      chorioamnionitis. Custom PCR was used to query individual patient samples from the 
      original cohort. The NGS screen generated 15 million reads. Seven unique viral 
      sequences were detected in two cases, all identified as torque teno virus (TTV), an 
      ubiquitous DNA anellovirus of no known pathogenicity. Using nested and semi-nested 
      PCR, sera from 72 patients (47 cases and 25 matched controls, stratified by ROM 
      status) were screened for the 3 subtypes of anelloviruses (TTV, TTMDV, or TTMV). 
      These were found in 43/47 cases (91%) and 16/25 controls (64%) (p = 0.012, OR = 5.9 
      (95% CI = 1.4-29.9)). In logistic regression, pregnant women with at least one type 
      of anellovirus were more likely to experience preterm labor than those with no 
      anellovirus (p = 0.03, aOR = 4.6, CI = 1.2-18.7). Among women experiencing a 
      spontaneous initiating event of labor, TTV virus was more likely to be present in 
      the serum of preterm than term patients. TTV may have a role in determining the 
      timing of parturition.

TI  - Discovering viral genomes in human metagenomic data by predicting unknown protein 
      families.
PG  - 28

AB  - Massive amounts of metagenomics data are currently being produced, and in all such 
      projects a sizeable fraction of the resulting data shows no or little homology to 
      known sequences. It is likely that this fraction contains novel viruses, but 
      identification is challenging since they frequently lack homology to known viruses. 
      To overcome this problem, we developed a strategy to detect ORFan protein families 
      in shotgun metagenomics data, using similarity-based clustering and a set of filters 
      to extract bona fide protein families. We applied this method to 17 virus-enriched 
      libraries originating from human nasopharyngeal aspirates, serum, feces, and 
      cerebrospinal fluid samples. This resulted in 32 predicted putative novel gene 
      families. Some families showed detectable homology to sequences in metagenomics 
      datasets and protein databases after reannotation. Notably, one predicted family 
      matches an ORF from the highly variable Torque Teno virus (TTV). Furthermore, 
      follow-up from a predicted ORFan resulted in the complete reconstruction of a novel 
      circular genome. Its organisation suggests that it most likely corresponds to a 
      novel bacteriophage in the microviridae family, hence it was named bacteriophage 
      HFM.

AB  - Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) may be the best naturally-occurring 
      model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC can be broadly 
      divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers 
      where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both 
      species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the 
      detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. 
      ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed 
      to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a 
      metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral 
      mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that 
      viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the 
      FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 
      (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), 
      alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus 
      in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% 
      and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC 
      samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in 
      FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely 
      related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying 
      genetic and environmental causes.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of DNA viruses from posttransplant lymphoproliferative 
      disorders.
PG  - 1013-1023
LID - 10.1002/cam4.1985 [doi]
AB  - Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), 50%-80% of which are strongly 
      associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), carry a high morbidity and mortality. Most 
      clinical/epidemiological/tumor characteristics do not consistently associate with 
      worse patient survival, so our aim was to identify if other viral genomic 
      characteristics associated better with survival. We extracted DNA from stored 
      paraffin-embedded PTLD tissues at our center, identified viral sequences by 
      metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS), and analyzed the data in relation to clinical 
      outcomes. Our study population comprised 69 PTLD tissue samples collected between 
      1991 and 2015 from 60 subjects. Nucleotide sequences from at least one virus were 
      detected by MSS in 86% (59/69) of the tissues (EBV in 61%, anelloviruses 52%, 
      gammapapillomaviruses 14%, CMV 7%, and HSV in 3%). No viruses were present in higher 
      proportion in EBV-negative PTLD (compared to EBV-positive PTLD). In univariable 
      analysis, death within 5 years of PTLD diagnosis was associated with anellovirus 
      (P = 0.037) and gammapapillomavirus (P = 0.036) detection by MSS, higher tissue qPCR 
      levels of the predominant human anellovirus species torque teno virus (TTV; 
      P = 0.016), T cell type PTLD, liver, brain or bone marrow location. In multivariable 
      analyses, T cell PTLD (P = 0.006) and TTV PCR level (P = 0.012) remained 
      significant. In EBV-positive PTLD, EBNA-LP, EBNA1 and EBNA3C had significantly 
      higher levels of nonsynonymous gene variants compared to the other EBV genes. 
      Multiple viruses are detectable in PTLD tissues by MSS. Anellovirus positivity, not 
      EBV positivity,was associated with worse patient survival in our series. 
      Confirmation and extension of this work in larger multicenter studies is desirable.

AB  - A novel blood-borne virus called the human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1) was recently 
      discovered in hemophilia patients. The present study aimed to investigate the 
      presence of HHpgV-1 in hemophilia patients. A total of 436 serum samples were 
      investigated for the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human pegivirus-1 
      (HPgV-1), torque teno virus (TTV), and HHpgV-1. Out of the 436 patients, 163 
      (37.4%), 19 (4.4%), 76 (17.4%), and four (0.9%) patients were positive for HCV, 
      HPgV-1, TTV, and HHpgV-1, respectively. HHpgV-1 patients had a mean viral load of 
      4.9 ± 0.3 log RNA copies/mL and were co-infected with HCV-1a, HPgV-1, and TTV. 
      Moreover, three HHpgV-1-positive patients exhibited stage F0 liver fibrosis. HCV 
      viral load in HHpgV-1-positive patients was lower than those of HHpgV-1-negative 
      patients. Results also revealed that co-infection of HHpgV-1 with HPgV-1 and HCV may 
      play a protective role in patients with chronic HCV. In conclusion, we detected a 
      low frequency of HHpgV-1 infection in hemophilia patients, and results suggested 
      that HHpgV-1 infection was correlated with the presence of other blood-borne viruses 
      and is likely to also correlate with low HCV viral load and reduced severity of 
      liver disease. Additional studies are required to further investigate the clinical 
      importance of HHpgV-1.

TI  - Waterborne Viruses and F-Specific Coliphages in Mixed-Use Watersheds: Microbial 
      Associations, Host Specificities, and Affinities with Environmental/Land Use 
      Factors.

AB  - From the years 2008 to 2014, a total of 1,155 water samples were collected (spring 
      to fall) from 24 surface water sampling sites located in a mixed-used but 
      predominantly agricultural (i.e., dairy livestock production) river basin in eastern 
      Ontario, Canada. Water was analyzed for viable F-specific DNA (F-DNA) and F-specific 
      RNA (F-RNA) (genogroup I [GI] to GIV) coliphage and a suite of molecularly detected 
      viruses (norovirus [GI to GIV], torque teno virus [TTV], rotavirus, kobuvirus, 
      adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis E). F-DNA and F-RNA coliphage 
      were detected in 33 and 28% of the samples at maximum concentrations of 2,000 and 
      16,300 PFU · 100 ml(-1), respectively. Animal TTV, human TTV, kobuvirus, astrovirus, 
      and norovirus GIII were the most prevalent viruses, found in 23, 20, 13, 12, and 11% 
      of samples, respectively. Viable F-DNA coliphage was found to be a modest positive 
      indicator of molecularly detected TTV. F-RNA coliphage, unlike F-DNA coliphage, was 
      a modest positive predictor of norovirus and rotavirus. There were, however, a 
      number of significant negative associations among F-specific coliphage and viruses. 
      F-DNA coliphage densities of >142 PFU · 100 ml(-1) delineated conditions when ∼95% 
      of water samples contained some type of virus. Kobuvirus was the virus most strongly 
      related to detection of any other virus. Land use had some associations with 
      virus/F-specific coliphage detection, but season and surface water flow were the 
      variables that were most important for broadly delineating detection. Higher 
      relative levels of detection of human viruses and human F-RNA coliphage were 
      associated with higher relative degrees of upstream human land development in a 
      catchment. IMPORTANCE: This study is one of the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate 
      relationships among F-specific coliphages and a large suite of enteric viruses in 
      mixed-use but agriculturally dominated surface waters in Canada. This study 
      suggested that relationships between viable F-specific coliphages and molecularly 
      detected viruses do exist, but they are not always positive. Caution should be 
      employed if viable F-specific coliphages are to be used as indicators of virus 
      presence in surface waters. This study elucidates relative effects of agriculture, 
      wildlife, and human activity on virus and F-specific coliphage detection. Seasonal 
      and meteorological attributes play a strong role in the detection of most virus and 
      F-specific coliphage targets.

TI  - A multiple SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR system for the simultaneous detection of 
      porcine circovirus type 2, porcine parvovirus, pseudorabies virus and Torque teno 
      sus virus 1 and 2 in pigs.

AB  - Multiple viral infections are common in pigs under intensive production conditions. 
      All five of the viruses included in this study are associated with multifactorial 
      diseases that cause significant economic losses in swine farming worldwide. The 
      development is described of a novel multiple real-time PCR system based on the use 
      of SYBR Green I that allows the simultaneous detection and differentiation of 
      porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), porcine parvovirus (PPV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and 
      Torque teno sus virus species 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) in pigs. The method was 
      able to distinguish between all five viral agents, and tests of other DNA viruses 
      proved the specificity of the system. The multiple real-time PCR system was 
      sensitive, as the limits of detection ranged from 3.65×10(3) to 5.04×10(3) copies of 
      DNA template per reaction. The coefficients of variation were low for both 
      intra-assay and inter-assay variability. In addition, the results of the multiple 
      real-time PCR system tests were 100% consistent with previous results based on 
      specific PCR assay testing of field samples. This method could be a useful tool for 
      epidemiological studies and disease management.

AB  - In our world, which is faced today with exceptional environmental changes and 
      dramatically intensifying globalisation, we are encountering challenges due to many 
      new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of novel, so far "unknown" 
      infectious diseases. Although a broad arsenal of diagnostic methods is at our 
      disposal, the majority of the conventional diagnostic tests is highly virus-specific 
      or is targeted entirely towards a limited group of infectious agents. This 
      specificity complicates or even hinders the detection of new or unexpected 
      pathogens, such as new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or novel viral variants. The 
      recently developed approaches of viral metagenomics provide an effective novel way 
      to screen samples and detect viruses without previous knowledge of the infectious 
      agent, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control, in line with the 
      "One World, One Health" principles (www.oneworldonehealth.org). Using metagenomic 
      approaches, we have recently identified a broad variety of new viruses, such as 
      novel bocaviruses, Torque Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and kobuviruses in 
      porcine disease syndromes, new virus variants in honeybee populations, as well as a 
      range of other infectious agents in further host species. These findings indicate 
      that the metagenomic detection of viral pathogens is becoming now a powerful, 
      cultivation-independent, and useful novel diagnostic tool in veterinary diagnostic 
      virology.

TI  - Monitoring of alphatorquevirus DNA levels for the prediction of 
      immunosuppression-related complications after kidney transplantation.
PG  - 1139-1149
LID - 10.1111/ajt.15145 [doi]
AB  - The replication kinetics of nonpathogenic anelloviruses belonging to the 
      Alphatorquevirus genus (such as torque teno virus) might reflect the overall state 
      of posttransplant immunosuppression. We analyzed 221 kidney transplant (KT) 
      recipients in whom plasma alphatorquevirus DNA load was quantified by real-time 
      polymerase chain reaction at baseline and regularly through the first 12 
      posttransplant months. Study outcomes included posttransplant infection and a 
      composite of opportunistic infection and/or de novo malignancy 
      (immunosuppression-related adverse event [iRAE]). Alphatorquevirus DNA loads at 
      month 1 were higher among patients who subsequently developed posttransplant 
      infection (P  = .023) or iRAE (P  = .009). Likewise, those with iRAE beyond months 3 
      and 6 also exhibited higher peak viral loads over the preceding periods. Areas under 
      the curve for log(10) alphatorquevirus DNAemia estimated by months 1 or 6 were 
      significantly higher in patients experiencing study outcomes. Alphatorquevirus DNA 
      loads above 3.15 and 4.56 log(10) copies/mL at month 1 predicted the occurrence of 
      posttransplant infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.88; 95% confidence interval 
      [CI]: 1.13-7.36; P  = .027) and iRAE (aHR: 5.17; 95% CI: 2.01-13.33; P  = .001). In 
      conclusion, posttransplant monitoring of plasma alphatorquevirus DNA kinetics may be 
      useful to identify KT recipients at increased risk of immunosuppression-related 
      complications.

TI  - [Metagenomics-based detection of swine viruses].
PG  - 197-203
AB  - Extreme varieties of viruses exist in the environment and animals, some of which are 
      unknown. However, many unknown viruses are barely detected by means of conventional 
      virus isolation and PCR assay. OBJECTIVE: To develop a technology platform for 
      detecting unknown viruses. METHODS: We established the technology based on viral 
      metagenomics in combination with novel molecular diagnostics. The technology is 
      consisted of removal of host nucleic acid, random PCR amplification, large-scale 
      sequencing, and bioinformatics. RESULTS: The technology was applied to detect 
      classical swine fever virus (CSFV)-infected cells and a tissue sample of a pig 
      infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). We amplified 13.7% sequences of CSFV 
      genome and 47.2% those of PCV2 genome, respectively. Moreover, we amplified 16.4% 
      sequences of the simian parainfluenza virus type 5 genome from an unknown virus cell 
      culture using the developed method. In addition, using the developed method combined 
      with the high-throughput sequencing, we detected 1.1% virus sequences, including 
      CSFV, PCV2, torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and human 
      adenovirus type 6 (Ad6) from 7 clinical swine samples of unknown causative agents. 
      CONCLUSION: The developed metagenomics-based method showed good sensitivity for 
      detection of both DNA and RNA viruses from diverse swine samples, and has potential 
      for universal detection of known and unknown viruses. It might facilitate the 
      diagnosis of emerging viral diseases.

TI  - Viral metagenomics analysis demonstrates the diversity of viral flora in piglet 
      diarrhoeic faeces in China.
PG  - 1603-1611
LID - 10.1099/vir.0.063743-0 [doi]
AB  - To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral 
      communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive 
      commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the 
      pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, 
      Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), 
      sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA 
      virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 
      (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and 
      Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified 
      from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses 
      were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 
      different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different 
      viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and 
      PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with 
      the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first 
      time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the 
      identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an 
      unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.

TI  - Viral metagenomics demonstrates that domestic pigs are a potential reservoir for 
      Ndumu virus.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The rising demand for pork has resulted in a massive expansion of pig 
      production in Uganda. This has resulted in increased contact between humans and 
      pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore 
      identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health 
      surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine 
      fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA 
      viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. FINDINGS: Serum samples from 
      16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. 
      Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among 
      the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). 
      African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous 
      retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had 
      sequences that showed 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads 
      had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to 
      result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. CONCLUSIONS: This is the 
      first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been 
      previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a 
      potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of 
      human-livestock-mosquito contact.

TI  - Frequency of diarrhoea-associated viruses in swine of various ages in Hungary.
PG  - 140-150
LID - 10.1556/004.2019.016 [doi]
AB  - Enteric viral diseases of swine are one of the most frequent disorders causing huge 
      economic losses in pork production. After the reappearance of an emerging 
      enteropathogen, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Hungary in 2016, an 
      extensive survey was initiated in an attempt to identify diarrhoea-related porcine 
      viruses, including adeno-, astro-, boca-, calici-, circo-, corona-, kobu-, rota- and 
      Torque teno viruses. A total of 384 faecal samples collected during a twoyear period 
      from diarrhoeic and asymptomatic pigs of various ages in 17 farms were screened by 
      conventional and real-time PCR methods. Half of the samples contained at least one 
      examined virus with the dominance of kobuvirus (55.1%) followed by bocaviruses 
      (33.2%) and rotavirus groups A and C together (20.9%), while coronaviruses including 
      PEDV were not found in this set of samples. Statistical analysis showed a highly 
      significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the frequency of single infections compared 
      to mixed ones with the exception of weaned pigs, in which group additionally most 
      viruses were detected. The results of this study suggest that the complexity of this 
      disease may vary with age, which makes the prevention of diarrhoea a challenge, 
      especially in weaned pigs.

TI  - The Virome of Acute Respiratory Diseases in Individuals at Risk of Zoonotic 
      Infections.
LID - E960 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v12090960 [doi]
AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasizes the need to 
      actively study the virome of unexplained respiratory diseases. We performed viral 
      metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis of 91 nasal-throat swabs from 
      individuals working with animals and with acute respiratory diseases. Fifteen virus 
      RT-PCR-positive samples were included as controls, while the other 76 samples were 
      RT-PCR negative for a wide panel of respiratory pathogens. Eukaryotic viruses 
      detected by mNGS were then screened by PCR (using primers based on mNGS-derived 
      contigs) in all samples to compare viral detection by mNGS versus PCR and assess the 
      utility of mNGS in routine diagnostics. mNGS identified expected human rhinoviruses, 
      enteroviruses, influenza A virus, coronavirus OC43, and respiratory syncytial virus 
      (RSV) A in 13 of 15 (86.7%) positive control samples. Additionally, rotavirus, 
      torque teno virus, human papillomavirus, human betaherpesvirus 7, cyclovirus, 
      vientovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were identified through mNGS. 
      Notably, complete genomes of novel cyclovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus 
      were genetically characterized. Using PCR screening, the novel cyclovirus was 
      additionally detected in 5 and the novel gemycircularvirus in 12 of the remaining 
      samples included for mNGS analysis. Our studies therefore provide pioneering data of 
      the virome of acute-respiratory diseases from individuals at risk of zoonotic 
      infections. The mNGS protocol/pipeline applied here is sensitive for the detection 
      of a variety of viruses, including novel ones. More frequent detections of the novel 
      viruses by PCR than by mNGS on the same samples suggests that PCR remains the most 
      sensitive diagnostic test for viruses whose genomes are known. The detection of 
      novel viruses expands our understanding of the respiratory virome of animal-exposed 
      humans and warrant further studies.

AB  - PURPOSE: To associate detection of potential pathogen DNA in endophthalmitis with 
      clinical outcomes. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: Patients in whom 
      endophthalmitis was diagnosed following an intraocular procedure were recruited. 
      Clinical outcome data from baseline, week-1, month-1, and month-3 visits were 
      collected. Intraocular biopsy samples were cultured by standard methods. 
      Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for specific pathogens 
      and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: A total of 50 patients (mean age 72 
      years old; 52% male) were enrolled. Twenty-four cases were culture-positive and 26 
      were culture-negative. WGS identified the cultured organism in 76% of 
      culture-positive cases and identified potential pathogens in 33% of culture-negative 
      cases. Month-1 and -3 visual acuities did not vary by pathogen-positive versus 
      pathogen-negative cases as detected by either culture or WGS. Visual outcomes of 
      Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis were no different than those of 
      pathogen-negative cases, whereas the patients infected with other pathogens showed 
      worse outcome. Higher baseline bacterial DNA loads of bacteria other than those of S 
      epidermidis detected by WGS were associated with worse month-1 and -3 visual acuity, 
      whereas the S epidermidis loads did not appear to influence outcomes. Torque teno 
      virus (TTV) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) were detected by qPCR in 49% and 19% 
      of cases, respectively. Presence of TTV at presentation was associated with a higher 
      rate of secondary pars plana vitrectomy (P = .009) and retinal detachment (P = 
      .022). CONCLUSIONS: The presence and higher load of bacteria other than S 
      epidermidis detected by WGS or DNA from TTV by qPCR in ocular fluids is 
      associated with worse outcomes in post-procedure endophthalmitis.

TI  - Circular genomes related to anelloviruses identified in human and animal samples by 
      using a combined rolling-circle amplification/sequence-independent single primer 
      amplification approach.
PG  - 2696-701
AB  - A combined rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and sequence-independent single primer 
      amplification (SISPA) approach was applied to four samples of human plasma and one 
      sample of saliva from a cat. This approach permitted the characterization of nine 
      anelloviruses. Most of them were identified as highly divergent strains that were 
      classified into species of the genus Anellovirus. The smallest anellovirus described 
      so far in humans was characterized (2PoSMA, 2002 nt; 'small anellovirus' species). 
      Two highly divergent sequences belonging to the species Torque Teno Mini Virus 
      (LIL-y1, 2887 nt; LIL-y2, 2871 nt), which clustered into a new phylogenetic branch, 
      were also identified in human plasma samples. Finally, two genomes that are 
      separated by a genetic divergence of 46 % were characterized in the cat's saliva, 
      one of these creating a distinct phylogenetic branch (PRA1, 2019 nt). These results 
      highlight the potential of RCA-SISPA for detecting circular (or circularized) 
      genomes.

AB  - Aim of this study was the retrospective investigation of viral (porcine circovirus 
      type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), torque 
      teno sus virus type 1 and 2 (TTSuV1, TTSuV2)) and bacterial (Bordetella 
      bronchiseptica (B. b.), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. h.), and Pasteurella multocida 
      (P. m.)) co-infections in 110 Pneumocystis spp. positive lung samples of Austrian 
      pigs with pneumonia. Fifty-one % were positive for PCV2, 7% for PRRSV, 22% for 
      TTSuV1, 48% for TTSuV2, 6% for B. b., 29% for M. h., and 21% for P. m. In 38.2% only 
      viral, in 3.6% only bacterial and in 40.0% both, viral and bacterial pathogens were 
      detected. In 29.1% of the cases a co-infection with 1 pathogen, in 28.2% with 2, in 
      17.3% with 3, and in 7.3% with 4 different infectious agents were observed. The 
      exposure to Pneumocystis significantly decreased the risk of a co-infection with 
      PRRSV in weaning piglets; all other odds ratios were not significant. Four 
      categories of results were compared: I = P. spp. + only viral co-infectants, II = P. 
      spp. + both viral and bacterial co-infectants, III = P. spp. + only bacterial 
      co-infectants, and IV = P. spp. single infection. The evaluation of all samples and 
      the age class of the weaning piglets resulted in a predomination of the categories I 
      and II. In contrast, the suckling piglets showed more samples of category I and IV. 
      In the group of fattening pigs, category II predominated. Suckling piglets can be 
      infected with P. spp. early in life. With increasing age this single infections can 
      be complicated by co-infections with other respiratory diseases.

TI  - Metagenomic analysis of viral diversity in respiratory samples from patients with 
      respiratory tract infections in Kuwait.
PG  - 412-420
LID - 10.1002/jmv.24984 [doi]
AB  - A metagenomic approach based on target independent next-generation sequencing has 
      become a known method for the detection of both known and novel viruses in clinical 
      samples. This study aimed to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to characterize 
      the viral diversity in respiratory samples from patients with respiratory tract 
      infections. We have investigated 86 respiratory samples received from various 
      hospitals in Kuwait between 2015 and 2016 for the diagnosis of respiratory tract 
      infections. A metagenomic approach using the next-generation sequencer to 
      characterize viruses was used. According to the metagenomic analysis, an average of 
      145, 019 reads were identified, and 2% of these reads were of viral origin. Also, 
      metagenomic analysis of the viral sequences revealed many known respiratory viruses, 
      which were detected in 30.2% of the clinical samples. Also, sequences of 
      non-respiratory viruses were detected in 14% of the clinical samples, while 
      sequences of non-human viruses were detected in 55.8% of the clinical samples. The 
      average genome coverage of the viruses was 12% with the highest genome coverage of 
      99.2% for respiratory syncytial virus, and the lowest was 1% for torque teno midi 
      virus 2. Our results showed 47.7% agreement between multiplex Real-Time PCR and 
      metagenomics sequencing in the detection of respiratory viruses in the clinical 
      samples. Though there are some difficulties in using this method to clinical samples 
      such as specimen quality, these observations are indicative of the promising utility 
      of the metagenomic sequencing approach for the identification of respiratory viruses 
      in patients with respiratory tract infections.

TI  - Detection and characterisation of novel bocavirus (genus Bocaparvovirus) and 
      gastroenteritis viruses from asymptomatic pigs in Ireland.
PG  - 27270
LID - 10.3402/iee.v5.27270 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Livestock animals have been the assumed source of several human 
      epidemics in recent years, for example, influenza H1N1, rotavirus G8/G9, and 
      MERS-CoV. Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to evaluate the risk 
      to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example, 
      failure to thrive. There is a paucity of data regarding detection and 
      characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in porcines 
      in Ireland. Recently, a number of small novel porcine DNA viruses have emerged 
      globally, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 
      & 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these 
      viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses which has been 
      recently detected in humans and animals. METHODS: In this study, the presence of 
      gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine 
      bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from 
      asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 specimens 
      were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a 
      subset of specimens (n=44) were then examined individually. Viral diversity was then 
      investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. RESULTS: Initial 
      screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three 
      distinct groups in phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in 
      this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and lineage I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some 
      specimens contained >1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong 
      correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm. CONCLUSION: 
      Investigating the diversity of circulating enteric viruses on Irish porcine farms is 
      important to improve the prophylactic tools available and to facilitate the early 
      detection of changes in circulating viruses.

AB  - Viral diversity associated with Antarctic wildlife remains poorly studied. 
      Nonetheless, over the past 5 years, there has been a concerted effort using viral 
      metagenomics approaches to identify and characterize viruses associated with 
      Antarctic pinniped and avian species. Here we used a viral metagenomics approach to 
      identify circular DNA viruses in buccal swab samples from Antarctic fur seals 
      (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on Livingston Island, Antarctica during the 
      2016/2017 field season. We identified two new lineages of anelloviruses, torque teno 
      Arctocephalus gazella virus (TTAgV)-1 (2083 nts) and -2 (2127-2143 nts), which are 
      most closely related to and cluster with a previously identified anellovirus 
      associated with California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) sharing ~ 60% 
      genome-wide pairwise identity. The ORF1 of TTAgVs share 26-41% amino acid similarity 
      to the ORF1 of other previously identified pinniped-associated anelloviruses.

AB  - Ticks are blood-feeding arachnids that are vectors of several important human and 
      animal pathogens. Little is known about single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that are 
      associated with these ectoparasites. As part of a pilot study to identify ssDNA 
      viruses present in ticks, female American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) and 
      blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) were collected in eastern Pennsylvania (USA), 
      and the extracted viral DNA was analyzed using viral metagenomics approaches. Three 
      genomoviruses were recovered from pooled samples of D. variabilis (n = 2) and I. 
      scapularis (n = 1): two belonging to the genus Gemycircularvirus, sharing < 63% 
      pairwise identity with other members within the genus; and the third belonging to 
      the genus Gemykolovirus, sharing < 70% pairwise identity to other gemykoloviruses. 
      Furthermore, a genome of an anellovirus belonging to the sharing 62-65% nucleotide 
      identity with torque teno canis viruses (genus Thetatorquevirus) was also recovered 
      from a D. variabilis pooled sample.

      metastasized to the brain.
PG  - 105800-105808
LID - 10.18632/oncotarget.22400 [doi]
AB  - The role of viral infections in the etiology of brain cancer remains uncertain. 
      Prior studies mostly focused on transcriptome or viral DNA integrated in tumor 
      cells. To investigate for the presence of viral particles, we performed metagenomics 
      sequencing on viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from 12 primary and 8 metastatic 
      human brain tumors. One brain tumor metastasized from a skin melanoma harbored two 
      new human anellovirus species, Torque teno mini virus Emory1 (TTMV Emory1) and 
      Emory2 (TTMV Emory2), while the remaining 19 samples did not reveal any exogenous 
      viral sequences. Their genomes share 63-67% identity with other TTMVs, and 
      phylogenetic clustering supports their classification within the Betatorquevirus 
      genus. This is the first identification of betatorqueviruses in brain tumors. The 
      viral DNA was in its expected non-integrated circular form, and it is unclear if the 
      viruses contributed to tumor formation. Whether the viruses originated from blood, 
      or the primary skin tumor could not be ascertained. Overall, our results demonstrate 
      the usefulness of viral metagenomics to detect previously unknown exogenous virus in 
      human brain tumors. They further suggest that active viral infections are rare 
      events in brain tumors, but support a follow-up larger scale study to quantify their 
      frequency in different brain tumor subtypes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between 
      Torque teno sus virus 1b (TTSuV1b) infection and other viral infections or vaccine 
      immunization in conventional pigs. METHODS: With overexpressed and purified viral 
      protein TTSuV1b as antigen, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
      method for detecting TTSuV1b antibody was established, which demonstrated great 
      specificity and reproducibility. Porcine serum samples (n = 212) were tested using 
      ELISA. Meanwhile, the antibodies against Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), 
      Pseudorabies Virus (PRV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus 
      (PRRSV), and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2) were also examined using the commercial 
      kits. RESULTS: Statistical analysis indicated that the level of anti-TTSuV1b 
      antibody was positively correlated with the level of anti-PCV2 antibody in a lesser 
      extent; the level of antibodies against TTSuV1b or PCV2 were significantly lower in 
      porcine serum with low level of TTSuV1b virus, implicating the potential consistency 
      and synchronization in the mechanism of TTSuV1b and PCV2 infection. Whereas, 
      antibodies against PRRSV or CSFV showed no statistical significance on comparison 
      with anti-TTSuV1b antibody, implicating that in conventional pigs, the antibody 
      level for PRRSV and CSFV were not significantly influenced by TTSuV1b infection. 
      CONCLUSION: In conclusion, examination of anti-TTSuV1b antibody in porcine serum 
      with the presently established ELISA method would serve as a supplementary approach 
      for etiological investigation, and the combined statistical analysis of the 
      antibodies against four other viruses might help to further understand the TTSuV1b 
      infection as well as its pathogenicity.

TI  - Elevated levels of circulating DNA in cardiovascular disease patients: metagenomic 
      profiling of microbiome in the circulation.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. An 
      expanding body of evidence supports the role of human microbiome in the 
      establishment of CVDs and, this has gained much attention recently. This work was 
      aimed to study the circulating human microbiome in CVD patients and healthy 
      subjects. The levels of circulating cell free DNA (circDNA) was higher in CVD 
      patients (n = 80) than in healthy controls (n = 40). More specifically, the relative 
      levels of circulating bacterial DNA and the ratio of 16S rRNA/β-globin gene copy 
      numbers were higher in the circulation of CVD patients than healthy individuals. In 
      addition, we found a higher circulating microbial diversity in CVD patients (n = 3) 
      in comparison to healthy individuals (n = 3) by deep shotgun sequencing. At the 
      phylum level, we observed a dominance of Actinobacteria in CVD patients, followed by 
      Proteobacteria, in contrast to that in healthy controls, where Proteobacteria was 
      predominantly enriched, followed by Actinobacteria. The circulating virome in CVD 
      patients was enriched with bacteriophages with a preponderance of Propionibacterium 
      phages, followed by Pseudomonas phages and Rhizobium phages in contrast to that in 
      healthy individuals, where a relatively greater abundance of eukaryotic viruses 
      dominated by Lymphocystis virus (LCV) and Torque Teno viruses (TTV) was observed. 
      Thus, the release of bacterial and viral DNA elements in the circulation could play 
      a major role leading to elevated circDNA levels in CVD patients. The increased 
      circDNA levels could be either the cause or consequence of CVD incidence, which 
      needs to be explored further.

TI  - Epidemiology, genetic diversity and evolution of canine astrovirus.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13663 [doi]
AB  - Astroviruses (AstVs) are major causative agents of gastroenteritis in children and 
      have been reported in many species. Canine astrovirus (CaAstV), as an enteric 
      pathogen, has been widely detected worldwide, but little is known about their 
      genetic diversity and evolution, partly owing to a lack of genomic data. Here, we 
      sequenced 12 nearly full-length CaAstV genomes to address the gap in knowledge. We 
      found 14 (13.2%) and 7 (3.35%) CaAstV-positive samples from pet dogs with and 
      without diarrhoea, respectively. Co-infections were with co-infection with Torque 
      teno canis virus (TTCaV) reported for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis of the 
      ORF2 gene revealed four major lineages. In particular, lineage 4 might have evolved 
      from a recombinant virus from lineage 2 and lineage 3. The strains sequenced here 
      clustered with lineages 2, 3 and 4 in contrast with other Chinese strains identified 
      previously that clustered with lineages 2 and 4. Amino acid sequence alignment 
      within lineage revealed intralineage amino acid diversity and that the type of 
      epidemic strains within lineages changes over time. Three amino acids substitutions 
      located in predicted B-cell epitopes, which might be involved escape of host 
      immunity. Moreover, frequent inter-clade ORF2 gene recombinants were identified. The 
      identification of individual recombination events and a recombinant lineage 
      indicated that recombination plays a crucial role in CaAstV genetic evolution and 
      diversity by generating divergent viruses. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of ORF1b, 
      the most conserved gene of astrovirus, revealed a close relationship between CaAstV 
      and California sea lion astroviruses. Overall, we report detailed information on the 
      genetic evolution and diversity of CaAstV, which indicates that CaAstV may pose 
      challenges for diagnostics and future control strategies.

      Antarctica.
PG  - vex017

LID - vex017
AB  - The viruses circulating among Antarctic wildlife remain largely unknown. In an 
      effort to identify viruses associated with Weddell seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) 
      inhabiting the Ross Sea, vaginal and nasal swabs, and faecal samples were collected 
      between November 2014 and February 2015. In addition, a Weddell seal kidney and 
      South Polar skua (Stercorarius maccormicki) faeces were opportunistically sampled. 
      Using high throughput sequencing, we identified and recovered 152 anellovirus 
      genomes that share 63-70% genome-wide identities with other pinniped anelloviruses. 
      Genome-wide pairwise comparisons coupled with phylogenetic analysis revealed two 
      novel anellovirus species, tentatively named torque teno Leptonychotes weddellii 
      virus (TTLwV) -1 and -2. TTLwV-1 (n = 133, genomes encompassing 40 genotypes) is 
      highly recombinant, whereas TTLwV-2 (n = 19, genomes encompassing three genotypes) 
      is relatively less recombinant. This study documents ubiquitous TTLwVs among Weddell 
      seals in Antarctica with frequent co-infection by multiple genotypes, however, the 
      role these anelloviruses play in seal health remains unknown.

TI  - High rates of detection and complete genomic analysis of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) 
      in the Lesser Antilles island of St. Kitts: Identification of PCV2b-PCV2d 
      recombinants.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.13583 [doi]
AB  - Although porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an economically important pathogen of swine, 
      there is a lack of information on PCV2 from the Lesser Antilles. In this 
      retrospective study, we report high rates of detection of PCV2 DNA in porcine faecal 
      (41.3%, 26/63) and kidney (32.8%, 20/61) samples from the Lesser Antilles island of 
      St. Kitts. Most of the PCV2-positive faecal samples were from diarrhoeic piglets 
      (23/26), with 15 animals exhibiting stunted growth and/or weight loss. Although the 
      PCV2-positive kidneys were from slaughter age, clinically healthy pigs, 
      microscopically, various degrees of inflammation (mild, moderate or severe) were 
      observed in 18 kidneys. Rotavirus-A, porcine parvovirus and torque teno sus virus 
      were detected in 2, 4 and 14 PCV2-positive samples, respectively. The complete 
      genomes of 18 St. Kitts PCV2 strains were amplified using three overlapping nested 
      PCR assays designed in the present study. By phylogenetic analysis of PCV2 open 
      reading frame 2 (ORF2) and complete genomes, 15 St. Kitts strains were assigned to 
      genotype PCV2b. The remaining three PCV2 strains were identified as PCV2b-PCV2d 
      recombinants, with the involvement of ORF2 in two of the strains. To our knowledge, 
      this is the first report on detection and genotyping of PCV2 strains from the Lesser 
      Antilles. Considering the significant contributions of pig farming to the regional 
      livestock economy and increasing demand for local pork in the Lesser Antilles, our 
      findings emphasize the importance of future studies on surveillance and genotyping 
      of PCV2 in other Caribbean islands of the region.

TI  - Clinical and Virological Aspects of HBV Reactivation: A Focus on Acute Liver 
      Failure.
LID - 10.3390/v11090863 [doi]
LID - 863
AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in immunosuppressed patients can cause 
      considerable morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate factors 
      associated with acute liver failure (ALF) in HBV reactivation. Clinical, laboratory, 
      and virological data of 87 patients with HBV reactivation were analyzed 
      retrospectively. Teno torque virus (TTV) plasma loads were measured as a measure of 
      immune competence. HBV genomes isolated from 47 patients were analyzed by 
      next-generation sequencing. A functional analysis of identified HBsAg mutants was 
      performed. In patients with ALF the diagnosis was significantly later confirmed than 
      in the non-ALF group. Patients diagnosed during immunosuppression had a milder 
      clinical course compared to later diagnosed patients (p = 0.018, OR = 4.17). TTV 
      viral loads did not differ significantly between the two groups. The HBV genomes 
      isolated from ALF patients had higher viral complexity. A mutation in C-region of 
      HBsAg (L216*), was associated with reduced HBsAg production and secretion. Patients 
      diagnosed with HBV reactivation during immunosuppression had a milder clinical 
      course compared to patients diagnosed during immune reconstitution. ALF was 
      associated with higher viral complexity. An HBsAg mutation (L216*) was found to be 
      more frequent in ALF patients and was associated with reduced HBsAg production and 
      secretion.

TI  - Early herpes and TTV DNAemia in septic shock patients: a pilot study.
PG  - 28
LID - 10.1186/s40635-019-0256-z [doi]
LID - 28
AB  - BACKGROUND: Septic shock patients exhibit an increased incidence of viral 
      reactivation. Precise timing of such reactivation-as an early marker of immune 
      suppression, or as a consequence of the later-is not known precisely. Here, using a 
      fully designed nucleic acid extraction automated procedure together with tailored 
      commercial PCR kits, we focused on the description of early reactivation within the 
      first week of ICU admission of several herpes viruses and Torque Teno virus (TTV) in 
      98 septic shock patients. RESULTS: Most of septic shock patients had at least one 
      viremia event during the first week (88%). TTV and herpesviruses were detected in 
      56% and 53% of septic shock patient, respectively. The two most frequent 
      herpesviruses detected within the first week were EBV (35%) and HSV1 (26%). 
      Different kinetic were observed among herpesviruses, faster for EBV and HSV1 than 
      for CMV and HHV6. Although no association was found between herpes viremia and 
      secondary infections, patients with herpesviridae-related viremia were more severe, 
      e.g., higher SOFA scores and plasma lactate levels. While reactivating only 1 virus 
      was not associated with mortality, patients with multiple viremia events had higher 
      ICU mortality. Surprisingly, EBV + TTV early reactivation seemed associated with a 
      lower D28 mortality. No clear association was observed between viremia and immune 
      biomarkers. CONCLUSION: Applying a semi-automated process of viral DNAemia 
      determination to this cohort of 98 patients with septic shock, we observed that the 
      number of patients with positive viremia increased during the first week in the ICU. 
      Of note, there was no improvement in predicting the outcome when using viremia 
      status. Nevertheless, this pilot study, introducing standardized procedures from 
      extraction to detection, provides the basis for future standardized diagnostic 
      criteria. A prospective longitudinal clinical study using these procedures will 
      enable determination of whether such viremia is due to a lack of a latent virus 
      control by the immune system or a true clinical viral infection.

AB  - As the outbreaks of COVID-19 in worldwide, coronavirus has once again caught the 
      attention of people. Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and 
      sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and 
      evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we 
      collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 
      213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine 
      parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno 
      canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV 
      subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, 
      we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic 
      analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the 
      most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain 
      B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both 
      of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known 
      subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 
      may a recombinant variant between CCoV-I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with 
      strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa 
      strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the 
      unknown functions. In a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and 
      evolution of canine coronavirus in China based on the available sequences, which is 
      urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.

AB  - Due to the high number of transfusions which patients with hereditary 
      hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia, sickle cell disease) receive, they represent high 
      risk of acquiring parenterally transmitted infectious diseases. In this respect, non 
      pathogenic human commensal viruses, which also demonstrate parenteral transmission 
      routes might also be acquired. One of the most widely spread 
      parenterally-transmitted human commensal viruses include the Human Pegivirus-1 
      (HPgV-1, GBV-C) and Torque teno viruses (TTV) including its SEN virus-like (SENV) 
      forms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA and 
      SENV-like viruses, among a group of patients with beta-thalassemia from a Blood 
      Transfusion Center in the São Paulo State, Brazil. The prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA was 
      14.3 % (n = 6/42) and all of the positive samples were characterized as belonging to 
      genotype 2 (83.3 % were referred to subgenotype 2A and 16.7 % to 2B). The prevalence 
      of SENV-like viruses was 28.6 % (n = 12/42). SENV-like viruses of the genotypes 
      SENV-H and SENV-A were classified during the performed phylogenetic analysis. Our 
      study came as a continuation of a viral metagenomic survey among multiple transfused 
      patients with beta-thalassemia. The obtained results shed a light on the prevalence 
      and genotype distribution of commensal parenterally transmitted viruses like HPgV-1 
      and SENV in this specific population. However, more studies are needed to evaluate 
      the clinical impact of these apparently non-pathogenic viruses in patients with 
      thalassemia and their significance for the hemotherapy.

TI  - A molecular epidemiological investigation of PEDV in China: Characterization of 
      co-infection and genetic diversity of S1-based genes.
PG  - 1129-1140

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an emerging and re-emerging epizootic 
      virus of swine that causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in China 
      and other countries. The variations in the virus, and its co-infections with other 
      enteric viruses, have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection. In the 
      current study, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 
      provinces or municipalities of China during 2015-2018. The enteric viruses causing 
      co-infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also 
      analysed. The results indicated that, of the 543 diarrhoea samples, 66.85% (363/543) 
      were positive for PEDV, and co-infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses 
      ranged from 3.58% (13/363) to 81.55% (296/363). Among these enteric viruses, the 
      signs of diarrhoea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co-infections 
      with porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV) and torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2) (p < .05). 
      The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and 
      exhibited genetic diversity. The virulence-determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic 
      strains were undergoing amino acid mutations, in which 
      S58_S58insQGVN-N135dup-D158_I159del-like mutations were common patterns (97.28%, 
      143/147). When compared with 2011-2014 PEDV strains, the amino acid mutations of 
      PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N-terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD), 
      and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, protein homology 
      modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations 
      of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the 
      surface of the S1 protein. These data provide a better understanding of the 
      co-infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China.

AB  - Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes 
      substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity 
      associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 
      PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and 
      de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses 
      from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive 
      and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly 
      associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but 
      most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, 
      bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each 
      virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched 
      clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the 
      PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 
      or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, 
      porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were 
      significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral 
      communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses 
      associated with it.
