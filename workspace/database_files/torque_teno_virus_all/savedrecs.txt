However, the history hidden in skeletal remains is practically unknown, as only parvovirus B19 and hepatitis B virus DNA have been detected in hard tissues so far. Here, we investigated the DNA prevalences of 38 viruses in femoral bone of recently deceased individuals. To this end, we used quantitative PCRs and a custom viral targeted enrichment followed by next generation sequencing. The data was analyzed with a tailor-made bioinformatics pipeline. Our findings revealed bone to be a much richer source of persistent DNA viruses than earlier perceived, discovering ten additional ones, including several members of the herpesand polyomavirus families, as well as human papillomavirus 31 and torque teno virus. Remarkably, many of the viruses found have oncogenic potential and/or may reactivate in the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals. Thus, their persistence warrants careful evaluation of their clinical significance and impact on bone biology. Our findings open new frontiers for the study of virus evolution from ancient relics as well as provide new tools for the investigation of human skeletal remains in forensic and archaeological contexts.

Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV-I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions.In a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in China based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies.														0882-4010		10.1016/j.micpath.2020.104209																		J	BCI:BCI202000606116	32404273			Torque teno viruses in health and disease		Webb, Brett; Rakibuzzaman, A.

They are detected at high rates in both healthy and diseased individuals and are considered a significant part of the mammalian virome. Similar to human TTVs, swine TTVs (TTSuVs) are epidemiologically linked to several coinfections including porcine circovirus types 2 and 3 and the porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome virus. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with TTSuVs resulted in lesions in multiple organs and exacerbation of coinfections, making TTSuVs the only members of the Anelloviridae family with experimental evidence for pathogenicity. However, due to the lack of reliable cell culture and animal models, mechanistic studies on viral immunity and pathogenesis are limited. The objective of this review is to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding the biology, detection, pathogenesis and public health significance of TTSuVs, while identifying gaps in knowledge which limit the field.

Investigating the microbiome using next-generation sequencing technology has revealed examples of mutualism and conflict between microbes and humans. Comparing to bacteria, the viral component of the microbiome (i.e., the "virome") is understudied. Somatic tissues of healthy individuals are usually inaccessible for the virome sampling; therefore, there is limited understanding of the presence and distribution of viruses in tissues in healthy individuals and how virus infection associates with human gene expression and perturbs immunological homeostasis. Results To characterize the human virome in a tissue-specific manner, here we performed meta-transcriptomic analysis using the RNA-sequencing dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We analyzed the 8991 RNA-sequencing data obtained from 51 somatic tissues from 547 individuals and successfully detected 39 viral species in at least one tissue. We then investigated associations between virus infection and human gene expression and human disease onset. We detected some expected relationships; for instance, hepatitis C virus infection in the liver was strongly associated with interferon-stimulated gene upregulation and pathological findings of chronic hepatitis. The presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 in one subject's brain strongly associated with immune gene expression. While torque teno virus was detected in a broad range of human tissues, it was not associated with interferon responses. Being notable in light of its association with lymphoproliferative disorders, Epstein-Barr virus infection in the spleen and blood was associated with an increase in plasma cells in healthy subjects. Human herpesvirus 7 was often detected in the stomach; intriguingly, it associated with the proportion of human leukocytes in the stomach as well as digestive gene expression. Moreover, virus infections in the local tissues associated with systemic immune responses in circulating blood. Conclusions To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive investigation of the human virome in a variety of tissues in healthy individuals through meta-transcriptomic analysis. Further investigation of the associations described here, and application of this analytical pipeline to additional datasets, will be useful to reveal the impact of viral infections on human health.

The variations in the virus, and its co-infections with other enteric viruses, have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection. In the current study, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of China during 2015-2018. The enteric viruses causing co-infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also analysed. The results indicated that, of the 543 diarrhoea samples, 66.85% (363/543) were positive for PEDV, and co-infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3.58% (13/363) to 81.55% (296/363). Among these enteric viruses, the signs of diarrhoea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co-infections with porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV) and torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2) (p < .05). The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity. The virulence-determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations, in which S58_S58insQGVN-N135dup-D158_I159del-like mutations were common patterns (97.28%, 143/147). When compared with 2011-2014 PEDV strains, the amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N-terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD), and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, protein homology modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the S1 protein. These data provide a better understanding of the co-infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China.														1865-1674	1865-1682	10.1111/tbed.13439																		J	BCI:BCI202000604339				Torque teno virus was misidentified in meat products from Romania by different methods of detection		Spandole-Dinu, Sonia; Berca, Lavinia Mariana (laviniamariana.berca@gmail.com) ; Adascalului, Marian; Niculae, Oana Mihaela; Nica, Remus; Toma, Mihai; Zoani, Claudia; Radu, Irina; Cimponeriu, Danut									Romanian Biotechnological Letters		2020	MAY-JUN 2020	25	3	1581-1586	1581	1586							Objectives: Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are newly discovered infectious agents, highly prevalent in healthy individuals world-wide, as well as in farm and wild animals. The purpose of this study was detection of human TTVs in meat products.Methods and Results: One hundred sixty meat products were purchased from retailers or Romanian producers, and DNA was extracted. Real-time PCR was used for detection of beef, pork, chicken and turkey DNA. Human TTVs were identified by PCR using sets of primers spanning the translated and untranslated regions in the viral genome. The specificity of the amplicons was checked by sequencing. No specific amplicons were obtained using primers targeting coding regions. Employing primers targeting 5'UTR, TTV and TTMV were detected in a high number of samples; however, the viral origin was not confirmed by sequencing. The sequences obtained were similar to regions from pig, chicken, turkey and bacterial genomes. The primers used in our study may not specifically detect TTVs when food-purified DNA is used as template.Conclusions: Further investigations are needed to determine whether TTVs could be reliable viral markers for foods quality assessment.														1224-5984		10.25083/rbl/25.3/1581.1586																		J	BCI:BCI202000492321	32402339			Epidemiology and evolutionary analysis of Torque teno sus virus		Li, Gairu; Wang, Ruyi; Cai, Yuchen; Zhang, Junyan; Zhao, Wen; Gao, Qi; Franzo, Giovanni; Su, Shuo (shuosu@njau.edu.cn)									Veterinary Microbiology		2020	MAY 2020	244		Article No.: 108668	108668								Single stranded (ss) DNA viruses are increasingly being discovered due to the ongoing development of modern technologies in exploring the virosphere. Characterized by high rates of recombination and nucleotide substitutions, it could be comparable to RNA virus ones. Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a standard ssDNA virus with a high population diversity, whose evolution is still obscure, further, it is frequently found in co-infections with other viruses threatening the porcine industry and therefore share the same host and epidemiological context. Here, we implement and describe approach to integrate viral nucleotide sequence analysis, surveillance data, and a structural approach to examine the evolution of TTSuVs, we collected samples from pigs displaying respiratory signs in China and revealed a high prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2, frequently as part of coinfections with porcine circoviruses (PCVs), especially in spleen and lung. In addition, thirty six strains sequenced were obtained to investigate their genetic diversity in China. The evolutionary history of TTSuVs were unveiled as following: At the nucleotide sequence level, TTSuVs ORF1 was confirmed to be a robust phylogenetic maker to study evolution comparably to full genomes. Additionally, extensive recombination discovered within TTSuVk2a (also 5 out of the 36 sequenced strains in this study revealed to be recombination). Then, pairwise distance, phylogenetic trees, and amino acid analysis confirmed TTSuVs species, and allowed to define circulating genotypes (ITSuV1-1, 1a-2, 1b-1, 1b-2, 1b-3, and k2a-1, k2a-2, k2b). Selection analysis uncovered seven and six positive selected sites in TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2, respectively. At the protein structure level, mapping of sites onto the three-dimensional structure revealed that several positive selected sites locate into potential epitopes, which might related to the potential escaping from host immune response. Our result could assist future studies on swine ssDNA virus classification, surveillance and control.														0378-1135	1873-2542	10.1016/j.vetmic.2020.108668																		J	BCI:BCI202000467541	32009246			Nationwide prevalence of Torque teno sus virus 1 and k2a in pig populations in Japan		Furukawa, Ayaka; Mitarai, Sumire; Takagi, Mitsuhiro; Yoshida, Yuuhei; Ozawa, Makoto (mozawa@vet.kagoshima-u.ac.jp) ; Taneno, Akira; Deguchi, Eisaburo									Microbiology and Immunology		2020	MAY 2020	64	5										Because broad genetic diversity has recently been detected in Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), the viral genome detection method needs to be improved to understand the prevalence of these viruses.

To determine the DNA prevalence of PPVs and their relationship with PMWS and PCV2-RF in Mexico, 170 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were selected from archival collections to detect PPVs using a nested polymerase chain reaction. The tissues were composed of 50 PMWS cases, 20 age-matched tissues from healthy pigs, 56 PCV2-related reproductive failure (PCV2(+)-RF) cases, and 44 PCV2(-)-RF cases. Overall, PPV2 and PPV6 were the most prevalent species (90.0% and 74.7%, respectively). In 8-11 week old pigs, the highest prevalence was for PPV6 and PPV3. Concerning reproductive failure, the PCV2-affected farms had a significantly higher prevalence for PPV6 (61.6%) and PPV5 (36.4%) than the PCV2-unaffected farms (35.0% and 5.0%, respectively). The concurrent infection rate was high, being significant for PPV2/PPV4 and PPV1/PPV5 within the PMWS cases and for PPV6/PPV5 among the PCV2(+)-RF tissues. PPV5 showed a significant relationship with PMWS, whereas PPV5 and PPV6 were significant for PCVAD. The prevalence and coinfection rate of PPVs in Mexico were markedly higher than that described in other countries, denoting that PPV5 and PPV6 might have a potential role in PCVAD in Mexico. It is concluded that it is likely that the density population of pigs in Mexico is contributing to high PPV inter-species and PCV2 coinfections which might lead to a different pathogenic outcome.			; Ramirez Alvarez, Hugo/G-1077-2017	Vargas Ruiz, Alejandro/0000-0001-7213-4604; Ramirez Alvarez, Hugo/0000-0003-1682-8104; Marin Flamand, Ernesto/0000-0003-1475-8982										0385-5600	1348-0421	10.1111/1348-0421.12782																		J	BCI:BCI202000579893	31859221			Molecular prevalence and genotypes of human pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1) and SENV-like viruses among multiply transfused patients with beta-thalassemia		Bezerra, Rafael dos Santos; Santos, Elaine Vieira; Silveira, Roberta Maraninchi; Silva Pinto, Ana Cristina; Covas, Dimas Tadeu; Kashima, Simone; Slavov, Svetoslav Nanev (svetoslav.slavov@hemocentro.fmrp.usp.br)									Transfusion and Apheresis Science		2020	APR 2020	59	2										Due to the high number of transfusions which patients with hereditary hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia, sickle cell disease) receive, they represent high risk of acquiring parenterally transmitted infectious diseases. In this respect, non pathogenic human commensal viruses, which also demonstrate parenteral transmission routes might also be acquired.One of the most widely spread parenterally-transmitted human commensal viruses include the Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1, GBV-C) and Torque teno viruses (TTV) including its SEN virus-like (SENV) forms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA and SENV-like viruses, among a group of patients with beta-thalassemia from a Blood Transfusion Center in the Sao Paulo State, Brazil. The prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA was 14.3 % (n= 6/42) and all of the positive samples were characterized as belonging to genotype 2 (83.3 % were referred to subgenotype 2A and 16.7 % to 2B). The prevalence of SENV-like viruses was 28.6 % (n= 12/42). SENV-like viruses of the genotypes SENV-H and SENV-A were classified during the performed phylogenetic analysis. Our study came as a continuation of a viral metagenomic survey among multiple transfused patients with beta-thalassemia. The obtained results shed a light on the prevalence and genotype distribution of commensal parenterally transmitted viruses like HPgV-1 and SENV in this specific population. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the clinical impact of these apparently non-pathogenic viruses in patients with thalassemia and their significance for the hemotherapy.

Many patients have concomitant diseases like kidney disorders requiring hemodialysis, a procedure carrying the hazard of transmitting other hepatitis viruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate for occult hepatitis B virus (HBV), SEN virus (SENV), and torque teno virus (TTV) among chronic HCV patients on maintenance hemodialysis to identify their impacts.Methods: A total of 325 hemodialysis patients were enrolled and divided into two groups based on HCV RNA testing results. Blood samples were collected before hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) using ELISA. HBV, SENV, and TTV DNA were detected by PCR. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was measured.Results: Anti-HBc and HBV DNA were detected in 73.1% and 50.8% of group 1 versus 36.4% and 22.6% of group 2. The serum ALT level was higher in group 1 than group 2. SENV was detected in 11.5% of group 1 versus 8.2% of group 2. TTV was detected in 29% of group 1 versus 27% of group 2.Conclusions: There is an increased prevalence of occult HBV in our locality among chronic HCV patients undergoing hemodialysis.

Although no pathogenic roles have been associated with anelloviruses, their high prevalence and perceived ubiquitousness have provoked scientific interest in understanding their molecular and biological characteristics. We used nested PCR to determine the prevalence of anelloviruses among 130 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and 130 healthy blood donors, and analyzed three near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates from HIV-infected and non-HIV infected Nigerians. Statistical analysis showed that the rate of TTV infection was significantly higher in the HIV-infected group (65%) than in the blood donor group (26%) (p < 0.05, chi(2) = 40.3). TTMV and TTMDV infections were very high in both groups, ranging between 88 and 95%. No significant association was found between TTV infection and age, sex, CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. Near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates FL100, FL08 and BD67 determined by next-generation sequencing were 3.6 kb, 3.2 kb and 2.9 kb, respectively, in size. Their GenBank accession numbers are MK820644, MK820645, MK820646, respectively. These isolates shared 59% sequence identity across the whole genome and clustered in two different phylogenetic groups. Our study established for the first time the circulation of TTV, TTMV and TTMDV in the Nigerian population, with a disproportionately higher prevalence of TTV in HIV-infected patients. The near-complete TTV genome sequences from Nigeria are similar to the sequences KT163879 and KT163916 (3748 and 3190 respectively), obtained from the plasma of HIV-infected subjects from the United States, and EU305675 (2919), identified in human plasma samples from France.														0304-8608	1432-8798	10.1007/s00705-020-04538-1																		J	BCI:BCI202000386272	32023916			The Molecular Epidemiology and Phylogeny of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) in Jordan		Sarairah, Haneen (hanin.sarairah@gmail.com) ; Bdour, Salwa (bsalwa@ju.edu.jo) ; Gharaibeh, Waleed (waleed.gharaibeh@ju.edu.jo)									Viruses-Basel		2020	FEB 2020	12	2	Article No.: 165	165								Torque teno virus (TTV) is the most common component of the human blood virobiota. Little is known, however, about the prevalence of TTV in humans and the most common farm domesticates in Jordan, or the history and modality of TTV transmission across species lines. We therefore tested sera from 396 Jordanians and 171 farm animals for the presence of TTV DNA using nested 5 '-UTR-PCR. We then performed phylogenetic, ordination and evolutionary diversity analyses on detected DNA sequences. We detected a very high prevalence of TTV in Jordanians (similar to 96%); much higher than in farm animal domesticates (similar to 29% pooled over species). TTV prevalence in the human participants is not associated with geography, demography or physical attributes. Phylogenetic, ordination and evolutionary diversity analyses indicated that TTV is transmitted readily between humans across the geography of the country and between various species of animal domesticates. However, the majority of animal TTV isolates seem to derive from a single human-to-animal transmission event in the past, and current human-animal transmission in either direction is relatively rare. In conclusion, animal TTV in Jordan is historically derived from human variants; however, ongoing human-animal TTV exchange is minimal and zoonotic infection seems to be of limited importance.

Seminars in Arthritis and Rheumatism		2020	FEB 2020	50	1	166-171	166	171							Objective: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a highly prevalent non-pathogenic anellovirus whose plasma levels may be a biomarker of immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to assess whether specific immune-targeting with different biologic drugs may differentially modulate TTV viremia in arthritis patients.Methods: TTV DNA load was quantified by PCR in a cross-sectional sample of 79 patients with chronic arthritis on biologic therapy (abatacept, infliximab, rituximab or tocilizumab), 31 patients treated with conventional DMARD5 (methotrexate and/or leflunomide), and 54 healthy individuals. Longitudinal changes in TTV load were analysed in a second group of 59 patients at baseline and 4-months after biologic therapy. Correlations between clinical or biological characteristics of recruited patients and TTV viremia were also analysed.Results: In the cross-sectional study, TTV load was significantly higher in patients who received abatacept, infliximab or tocilizumab compared to healthy individuals. Patients treated with rituximab or conventional DMARDs showed TTV loads similar to healthy controls. In the longitudinal study, an increase in the TTV load was observed after anti-TNF, tocilizumab, abatacept and rituximab, but not after secukinumab therapy. Correlations between TTV load and clinical variables such as disease duration, concomitant glucocorticoid or DMARD5 therapy, lymphocytes or previous infections were not found. A non-significant trend towards higher TIN load was observed in therapy responders.Conclusion: Patients with chronic arthritis on biologic but not on conventional DMARD or anti-IL17 therapy have increased TTV viremia. This observation provides a basis to prospectively explore the potential value of TTV load as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have demonstrated varying grades of association between TTV DNA levels and immune deficiencies related to age, chronic infections and cancer. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been related to persistent viral infections such as HSV-1 and CMV, but it is not known whether TTV viral load could serve as a functional biomarker of cellular immunity in this setting. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether TTV infection and viral load is related to AD status, CMV immunity, systemic inflammation or HLA types connected to anti-viral immunity. A total of 50 AD subjects and 51 non-demented controls were included in the study. AD subjects were diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria and neuroradiologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis. TTV viral load was analyzed in plasma samples using a quantitative real-time PCR. Using a cut-off for TTV status at 200 copies/ml, 88% (89/101) of the study subjects were classified as TTV positive. TTV viral load significantly increased with age (beta 0.049 per year, p< 0.001) but significantly decreased in relation to CMV IgG levels (beta -0.022 per 1000 units, p = 0.005) and HLA-B27 positivity (beta -0.53, p = 0.023). In conclusion, TTV immune control is not significantly affected by AD status, but appears related to age, CMV humoral immune response and HLA type.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0227670																		J	BCI:BCI202000536267	31910220			Detection of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) and TTV-Like Minivirus in patients with presumed infectious endophthalmitis in India		Naik, Poonam; Dave, Vivek Pravin; Joseph, Joveeta (joveeta@lvpei.org)									PLoS One		2020	JAN 7 2020	15	1	Article No.: e0227121	e0227121								Human anelloviruses (Torque Teno Virus (TTV) and TTV Like Mini Virus (TLMV)) are now being reported at a high prevalence across the world, with a controversial disease-inducing potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these anellovirus in vitreous of patients with presumed infectious endophthalmitis. After informed consent, vitreous fluid from patients with endophthalmitis (n = 103) and non-infectious pathologies (n = 102) were analyzed for the presence of TTV and TLMV DNA by qPCR with the limit of quantification defined as 100 copies per reaction. Among the patients clinically diagnosed with endophthalmitis, 29 of the 40 culture proven samples (72.5%) and 42 out of 63 (66.6%) of culture-negative samples were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV. Interestingly, 51 of the 102 (50%) samples in the control group were also positive for TTV/TLMV. Comparing the clinical outcome among patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis, we observed no significant association in the final visual acuity of patients who were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV, however, these patients had significantly higher repeat antibiotic injections (p = 0.03). Further evidence is however needed to correlate TTV / TLMV with a particular pathology or group of pathologies in the eye.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0227121																		J	BCI:BCI202000218653	31902496			A virome sequencing approach to feline oral squamous cell carcinoma to evaluate viral causative factors		Chu, Shirley (chus@missouri.edu) ; Wylie, Todd N.; Wylie, Kristine M.; Johnson, Gayle C.; Skidmore, Zachary L.; Fleer, Maren; Griffith, Obi L.; Bryan, Jeffrey N.									Veterinary Microbiology		2020	JAN 2020	240		Article No.: 108491	108491								Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) may be the best naturally-occurring model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alpha-herpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes.														0378-1135	1873-2542	10.1016/j.vetmic.2019.108491																		J	BCI:BCI202000197361	31875016			No metagenomic evidence of tumorigenic viruses in cancers from a selected cohort of immunosuppressed subjects		Passaro, Nunzia; Casagrande, Andrea; Chiara, Matteo; Fosso, Bruno; Manzari, Caterina; D'Erchia, Anna Maria; Iesari, Samuele; Pisani, Francesco; Famulari, Antonio; Tulissi, Patrizia; Mastrosimone, Stefania; Maresca, Maria Cristina; Mercante, Giuseppe; Spriano, Giuseppe; Corrado, Giacomo; Vizza, Enrico; Garbuglia, Anna Rosa; Capobianchi, Maria Rosaria; Mottini, Carla; Cenci, Alessandra; Tartaglia, Marco; Costa, Alessandro Nanni; Pesole, Graziano; Crescenzi, Marco (marco.crescenzi@iss.it)									Scientific Reports		2019	DEC 24 2019	9		Article No.: 19815	19815								The possible existence of yet undiscovered human tumorigenic viruses is still under scrutiny. The development of large-scale sequencing technologies, coupled with bioinformatics techniques for the characterization of metagenomic sequences, have provided an invaluable tool for the detection of unknown, infectious, tumorigenic agents, as demonstrated by several recent studies. However, discoveries of novel viruses possibly associated with tumorigenesis are scarce at best. Here, we apply a rigorous bioinformatics workflow to investigate in depth tumor metagenomes from a small but carefully selected cohort of immunosuppressed patients. While a variegated bacterial microbiome was associated with each tumor, no evidence of the presence of putative oncoviruses was found. These results are consistent with the major findings of several recent papers and suggest that new human tumorigenic viruses are not common even in immunosuppressed populations.

TTV was previously considered a probable cause of hepatitis, but further studies could not strongly connect TTV to any serious health problem. TTV is highly resistant to water and wastewater treatment processes and can be a useful indicator for determining the fecal contamination of water. The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence and molecular characterization of TTV in treated wastewater in Tehran. Thirteen effluent samples were collected monthly from the biggest wastewater treatment plant in Tehran, Iran (from September 2017 to August 2018). The presence of the TTV was monitored in the samples by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The TTV genome was found in 76.9% of the samples, and TTV of groups 1 and 3 were determined using phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, treated wastewater can play a key role in the transmission of TTV and the usage of treated wastewater as a source of potable water needs to be carefully controlled.														1477-8920	1477-8920	10.2166/wh.2019.137																		J	BCI:BCI201900879563	31620095			Metagenomic Investigation of Torque Teno Mini Virus-SH in Hematological Patients		Bal, Antonin; Oriol, Guy; Josset, Laurence; Generenaz, Laurence; Sarkozy, Clementine; Sesques, Pierre; Salles, Gilles; Morfin, Florence; Lina, Bruno; Becker, Jeremie; Reynier, Frederic; Mallet, Francois; Pachot, Alexandre; Cheynet, Valerie; Brengel-Pesce, Karen; Trouillet-Assant, Sophie (sophie.assant@chu-lyon.fr)									Frontiers in Microbiology		2019	SEP 18 2019	10		Article No.: 1898	1898								A new member of Anelloviridae, named torque teno mini virus (TTMV)-SH, was recently identified in the serum of three Hodgkin's lymphoma patients suggesting that TTMV-SH may be associated with this type of hematological malignancy. We investigated by metagenomic analysis the presence of TTMV-SH-related viruses in plasma samples (n = 323) collected from patients with various hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma (MM, n = 256), non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL, n = 20), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 10)) and from healthy donors (n = 37). TTMV-SH-related strains were identified in 24 samples corresponding to four MM and one NHL patients. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the 24 isolates were close to the TTMV-SH strains previously identified, sharing 79.6-86.7% ORF1 nucleotide sequence identity. These results suggest that TTMV-SH-related viruses might be found in hematological diseases other than Hodgkin's lymphoma. Due to the high genetic variability within Anelloviridae species, the association between a particular medical condition and a new genotype should be interpreted with caution.

HBV genomes isolated from 47 patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. A functional analysis of identified HBsAg mutants was performed. In patients with ALF the diagnosis was significantly later confirmed than in the non-ALF group. Patients diagnosed during immunosuppression had a milder clinical course compared to later diagnosed patients (p = 0.018, OR = 4.17). TTV viral loads did not differ significantly between the two groups. The HBV genomes isolated from ALF patients had higher viral complexity. A mutation in C-region of HBsAg (L216*), was associated with reduced HBsAg production and secretion. Patients diagnosed with HBV reactivation during immunosuppression had a milder clinical course compared to patients diagnosed during immune reconstitution. ALF was associated with higher viral complexity. An HBsAg mutation (L216*) was found to be more frequent in ALF patients and was associated with reduced HBsAg production and secretion.

Drug-induced immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients is crucial to prevent allograft rejection, but increases risk for infectious disease. Immunologic monitoring to tailor immunosuppressive drugs might prevent alloreactivity and adverse effects simultaneously. The apathogenic torque teno virus (TTV) reflects the immunocompetence of its host and might act as a potential candidate for a holistic monitoring.Methods. We screened all 1010 consecutive patients from the prospective Vienna Kidney Transplant Cohort Study for availability of allograft biopsies and adequately stored sera for TTV quantification by polymerase chain reaction.Results. Patients with acute biopsy-proven alloreactivity according to the Banff classification (n = 33) showed lower levels of TTV in the peripheral blood compared to patients without rejection (n = 80) at a median of 43 days before the biopsy. The risk for alloreactivity decreased by 10% per log level of TTV copies/mL (risk ratio, .90 [95% confidence interval, .84-.97]; P = .005). TTV levels >1 x 10(6) copies/mL exclude rejection with a sensitivity of 94%. Multivariable generalized linear modeling suggests an independent association between TTV level and alloreactivity.Conclusions. TTV is a prospective biomarker for risk stratification of acute biopsy-proven alloreactivity in kidney transplant recipients and might be a potential tool to tailor immunosuppressive drug therapy.

Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option in end-stage lung diseases; however, survival after transplantation is limited by acute and chronic rejection or infectious events being results of inappropriate immunosuppression. Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs) are ubiquitous DNA viruses in humans but not found to be causative for any disease. However, some reports suggest that TTV-DNA levels reflect the grade of immunosuppression with higher levels being found in more immunosuppressed individuals. Methods. We investigated the TTV-DNA levels in 34 lung transplant recipients within their first year after transplantation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were extracted from charts. Results. In accordance with previous results TTV-DNA levels increase after lung transplantation reaching a steady state after 3 months. The TTV-DNA levels were not correlated with immunosuppressive trough levels and a selective increase was not observed with other DNA viruses. In steady state TTV-DNA levels were significantly higher in patients with infectious complications compared to the group of patients without. Additionally, TTV-DNA levels decreased significantly before biopsy-proven rejection. Sensitivity of a 10-fold decrease in TTV-DNA levels for a subsequent rejection episode was 0.74 with a specificity of 0.99. Conclusions. In summary, TTV-DNA might be used as an additional tool to monitor immunosuppression in lung transplant recipients. Higher TTV-DNA levels reflect more intense immunosuppression, whereas the TTV-DNA kinetic (ie, decrease of TTV-DNA levels) indicate rejection.

It is uncertain whether it may behave similarly in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (allo-HSCT). Here, we characterized the dynamics of TTV DNAemia in patients undergoing T-cell replete allo-SCT at late times after transplantation (>day+100). This retrospective single-center observational study included 33 allo-HSCT patients. Plasma TTV DNA loads were quantified by real-time PCR before initiating the conditioning regimen and at different time points after transplant. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were measured by flow cytometry. Overall, TTV DNA load increased steadily after engraftment, reaching a peak by day+90; afterwards, it remained relatively constant until day+210. TTV DNA loads measured within days+120 and +210 correlated inversely with paired ALC, while both parameters did correlate directly within days+20 and +60. The median TTV DNA area under a curve between days+90 and +210 [(AUC)(90-210)] was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroids within this time frame for treatment of graft versus host disease (either acute, chronic or both) than in controls (P=0.025). In summary, TTV DNA load may mirror the degree of immunosuppression at late times after allo-HSCT.

DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples and the two polymorphisms and the presence of torque teno virus DNA were tested by PCR-based methods. StatsDirect was used for data analysis.Results: Our data showed that lifestyle choices (e.g. inadequate personal oral hygiene -O.R. =7.66, p<0.0001, taking irregular meals -O.R. =2.82, p<0.001 and smoking O.R.=1.5, p=0.01) increase the risk of periodontitis. We also identified differences in distribution of TGFb1 C-509T and IL-6 G-174C polymorphisms in patients and control groups. However, there was no association between the distribution of TGFb C-509T variants and the risk of periodontitis in male (p=0.85). There was an association between the presence of IL6 -174G allele and chronic periodontitis in the overall group of subjects (O.R.=1.6, p=0.01) and in men (O.R.=1.82, p=0.02), but not in women (p=0.2). The prevalence of TTV DNA and association with periodontitis was consistent with previous studies.Conclusions: Lifestyle choices, IL6 G-174C and TTV were associated with periodontitis in our lot. Further investigation conducted on a larger group with less confounding factors is required in order to validate these findings.

After the reappearance of an emerging enteropathogen, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Hungary in 2016, an extensive survey was initiated in an attempt to identify diarrhoea-related porcine viruses, including adeno-, astro-, boca-, calici-, circo-, corona-, kobu-, rota- and Torque teno viruses. A total of 384 faecal samples collected during a two-year period from diarrhoeic and asymptomatic pigs of various ages in 17 farms were screened by conventional and real-time PCR methods. Half of the samples contained at least one examined virus with the dominance of kobuvirus (55.1%) followed by bocaviruses (33.2%) and rotavirus groups A and C together (20.9%), while coronaviruses including PEDV were not found in this set of samples. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the frequency of single infections compared to mixed ones with the exception of weaned pigs, in which group additionally most viruses were detected. The results of this study suggest that the complexity of this disease may vary with age, which makes the prevention of diarrhoea a challenge, especially in weaned pigs.														0236-6290	1588-2705	10.1556/004.2019.016																		J	BCI:BCI201900441129	30697958			Metagenomic analysis of DNA viruses from posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders		Dharnidharka, Vikas R.

Most clinical/epidemiological/tumor characteristics do not consistently associate with worse patient survival, so our aim was to identify if other viral genomic characteristics associated better with survival. We extracted DNA from stored paraffin-embedded PTLD tissues at our center, identified viral sequences by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS), and analyzed the data in relation to clinical outcomes. Our study population comprised 69 PTLD tissue samples collected between 1991 and 2015 from 60 subjects. Nucleotide sequences from at least one virus were detected by MSS in 86% (59/69) of the tissues (EBV in 61%, anelloviruses 52%, gammapapillomaviruses 14%, CMV 7%, and HSV in 3%). No viruses were present in higher proportion in EBV-negative PTLD (compared to EBV-positive PTLD). In univariable analysis, death within 5 years of PTLD diagnosis was associated with anellovirus (P = 0.037) and gammapapillomavirus (P = 0.036) detection by MSS, higher tissue qPCR levels of the predominant human anellovirus species torque teno virus (TTV; P = 0.016), T cell type PTLD, liver, brain or bone marrow location. In multivariable analyses, T cell PTLD (P = 0.006) and TTV PCR level (P = 0.012) remained significant. In EBV-positive PTLD, EBNA-LP, EBNA1 and EBNA3C had significantly higher levels of nonsynonymous gene variants compared to the other EBV genes. Multiple viruses are detectable in PTLD tissues by MSS. Anellovirus positivity, not EBV positivity,was associated with worse patient survival in our series. Confirmation and extension of this work in larger multicenter studies is desirable.

To explore a possible viral implication, we investigated the virome of cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 70 febrile pediatric inpatients with clinical compatible encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Using viral metagenomics, we detected and genetically characterized three novel human Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) species (TTMV-G1-3). Phylogenetically, TTMV-G1-3 clustered in three novel monophyletic lineages within genus Betatorquevirus of the Anelloviridae family. TTMV-G1-3 were highly prevalent in diseased children, but absent in the healthy cohort which may indicate an association of TTMV species with febrile illness. With 2/3 detected malaria co-infection, it remains unclear if these novel anellovirus species are causative agents or increase disease severity by interaction with malaria parasites. The presence of the viruses 28 days after initiating antimalarial and/or antibiotic treatment suggests a still active viral infection likely as effect of parasitic and/or bacterial co-infection that may have initiated a modulated immune system environment for viral replication or a defective virus clearance. This study increases the current knowledge on the genetic diversity of TTMV and strengthens that human anelloviruses can be considered as biomarkers for strong perturbations of the immune system in certain pathological conditions.

PCV2 infections may downregulate the host immune system and enhance the infection and replication of other pathogens. However, the exact mechanisms of PCVD/PCVAD are currently unknown. To date, many studies have reported that several cofactors, such as other swine viruses or bacteria, vaccination failure, and stress or crowding, in combination with PCV2, lead to PCVD/PCVAD. Among these cofactors, co-infection of PCV2 with other viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, swine influenza virus and classical swine fever virus have been widely studied for decades. In this review, we focus on the current state of knowledge regarding swine co-infection with different PCV2 genotypes or strains, as well as with PCV2 and other swine viruses.

Acta Virologica		2019		63	2	186-194	186	194							Little is known about the role of genetic variation in the genes for cytokines and susceptibility to viral infection especially torque teno virus (TTV) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this study, the association between interleukin-12, interleukin-17, interleukin-10 (IL-12,-17,-10) and tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-alpha) polymorphisms was evaluated in patients with TTV infection who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from South of Iran. The single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytokine genes including IL-12 (-1188A/C), IL-17 (-197G/A), IL-10 (-1082G/A, -819C/T and -592C/A) and TNF-alpha (-308 G/A) were analyzed by PCR-RFLP methods. While our results did not show any association between IL-17, IL-12 and IL-10 (-819C/T and -1082G/A) polymorphisms and TTV infection status, heterozygote genotype of IL-10 (-592C/A) had direct correlation with TTV infection and A allele of TNF-alpha (-308G/A) showed a protective effect against TTV infection (P = 0.05 and P = 0.025, respectively). Within the group of patients who experienced acute graft-versus-host disease, the AA genotype and the A allele of IL-17 (-197 G/A) were significantly higher in non-infected patients compared to infected ones (p = 0.024 and p = 0.057, respectively). It was also observed that among infected patients, the GG genotype of IL-17 and AA genotype of TNF-a were significantly increased in hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients with low grade (grade I+ II) acute graftversus- host disease compared to high grade (grade III and IV) disease (p = 0.056 and p = 0.056, respectively). Taken together, genetic variation of IL-10 (-592C/A) and TNF-alpha (-308G/A) genes might be associated with susceptibility to TTV infection post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

However, thermal treatment is the currently preferred method of solid waste disposal. Hygienic assessment of working conditions in municipal waste incineration plants is hindered due to the variability and complexity of pollutants emitted during the combustion process. For many years studies describing this problem have focused mainly on chemical pollution inside the plants as well as emitted into the atmosphere. Available data indicates the presence of organic dust at workplaces in the range 0.1-14 mg/m(3). It has been proven that it is a carrier of a wide spectrum of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and both mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes as well as adenoviruses and torque teno virus (TTV). In the air, at workplaces, bacterial endotoxins have also been found in concentrations reaching even 50 000 EU/m(3), which may significantly affect the occurrence of pro-inflammatory reactions in the lungs as well as toxic pneumonitis. Biological agents should be taken into account in the occupational risk assessment for harmful agents present in this environment, and an in-depth characterization of exposure and health effects resulting from contact with these agents should be continued to an even greater extent than before.

KD can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Its epidemiological characteristics, such as seasonality and clinical picture of acute systemic inflammation with prodromal intestinal/respiratory symptoms, suggest an infectious etiology for KD. Interestingly, multiple host genotypes have been identified as predisposing factors for KD. To explore experimental methodology for identifying etiological agent(s) for KD and to optimize epidemiological study design (particularly the sample size) for future studies, we conducted a pilot study. For a 1-year period, we prospectively enrolled 11 patients with KD. To each KD patient, we assigned two control individuals (one with diarrhea and the other with respiratory infections), matched for age, sex, and season of diagnosis. During the acute phase of disease, we collected peripheral blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and feces. We also determined genotypes, to identify those that confer susceptibility to KD. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the risk genotypes between KD patients and control subjects. We also used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to analyze these samples. Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 (TTV7) in two patients with KD (18%), but not in control subjects (P = 0.111). Sanger sequencing revealed that the TTV7 found in the two KD patients contained almost identical variants in nucleotide and identical changes in resulting amino acid, relative to the reference sequence. Additionally, we estimated the sample size that would be required to demonstrate a statistical correlation between TTV7 and KD. Future larger scale studies with carefully optimized metagenomic sequencing experiments and adequate sample size are warranted to further examine the association between KD and potential pathogens, including TTV7.

Using multivariate Cox-regression contribution of TTV-load to the occurrence of severe infections, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), acute cellular rejection (ACR), and death was assessed. During follow-up 28 (20%) patients developed infections with a rate of 7.7 per 100 patient-years (PY). The hazard-ratio (HR) associated with a one-log10 increase of TTV-load before the event was 5.05. CLAD occurred with a rate of 6.0%-PY. HR for a 1 log10 increase of the lowest TTV level before the event was 0.71 (CI: 0.54-0.93). TTV-load predicts clinical events and may be useful to optimize IS during the first years of follow-up of LTRs.

Iotatorquevirus species possess high genomic variability, suggesting that diverse genotypes are widely geographically distributed. In this study, we validated the genomic variability of Iotaroquevirus species in pigs with postweaned multisystemic wasting syndrome. Genomic DNA from nine TTSuV1a-positive tissues and 15 TTSuV1b-positive tissues was used to amplify the complete ORF2 of each species by nested PCR to perform a molecular characterization. It was found that Mexican TTSuV1a sequences belong to genotype B, sharing phylogenetic origin, high nucleic acid and amino acid sequence similarity and dominant epitope conformation with commercially linked countries, such as the United States, Canada and China, whereas the Mexican TTSuV1b sequences belong to genotype A, being more divergent among each other and displaying low nucleotide identity with worldwide genotype A sequences. In both Iotatorquevirus species, a PTPase-like signature motif was identified in the predicted amino acid sequence, being more conserved for Mexican TTSuV1b sequences than for Mexican TTSuV1a sequences, in which several substitutions were observed. These changes may influence the conformation of dominant epitopes as different arrays were determined among TTSuV1a genotypes. ORF2 variability may account for pathogenic differences by modifying viral replication and immune response, as depicted for human TTV.

Although viral infections are considered to be the most common etiology of myocarditis, the identification of the causative virus is still challenging. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The aim of the current study was to comprehensively analyze potential pathogenic microorganisms using NGS in the sera of patients with myocarditis. Twelve pediatric and five adult patients hospitalized for acute myocarditis were included. Serum samples in the acute phase were obtained and analyzed using NGS to detect pathogen-derived DNA and RNA. Viral sequence reads were detected in 7 (41%) of the 17 myocarditis patients by NGS. Among these patients, detection of Epstein-Barr virus, human parvovirus B19, torque teno virus, and respiratory syncytial virus reads by NGS was consistent with polymerase chain reaction or antigen test results in one patient each. A large number of human pegivirus reads were detected from one patient by RNA sequencing; however, its pathogenicity to human is unknown. Conversely, the number of detected virus-derived reads was small in most cases, and the pathophysiological role of these viruses remains to be clarified. No significant bacterial or fungal reads other than normal bacterial flora was detected. These data indicate that comprehensive detection of virus-derived DNA and RNA using NGS can be useful for the identification of potential pathogenic viruses in myocarditis.We evaluated the utility of NGS to detect potential pathogens of acute myocarditis. Viral sequence reads were obtained in 7 of 17 (41%) cases. A large number of human pegivirus reads was detected from one patient. NGS has the potential to detect the etiologic agent of acute myocarditis.			ゆか, 鳥居/AAK-6344-2020; Okuno, Yusuke/C-9082-2009; Horiba, Kazuhiro/V-9420-2019; Horiba, Kazuhiro/AAK-4496-2020; Kawada, Jun-ichi/I-7322-2014	Okuno, Yusuke/0000-0003-3139-9272; Kawada, Jun-ichi/0000-0003-1553-2539; Takeuchi, Suguru/0000-0002-7346-4506										0146-6615	1096-9071	10.1002/jmv.25263																		J	BCI:BCI201900109426	30555452			Post-transplant Replication of Torque Teno Virus in Granulocytes		Kosulin, Karin (karin.kosulin@ccri.at) ; Kernbichler, Silvia; Pichler, Herbert; Lawitschka, Anita; Geyeregger, Rene; Witt, Volker; Lion, Thomas (thomas.lion@ccri.at)									Frontiers in Microbiology		2018	NOV 29 2018	9		Article No.: 2956	2956								Torque Teno virus (TTV) in humans is characterized by ubiquitous occurrence in peripheral blood (PB), without any related disease described to date. Several studies reported a significant increase of TTV plasma DNA levels in allogeneic transplant recipients, and suggested a correlation of elevated virus titers with immunosuppression and transplant-related complications. However, the site of viral replication in this setting has remained unclear. We have studied TTV in serial plasma specimens derived from 43 pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients by RQ-PCR, and found increasing TTV-DNA levels in all patients post-transplant, with a peak around day +100 and maximum virus copy numbers reaching 4 x 10E9/ml. To assess whether the virus replicates in PB-cells, leukocyte subsets including granulocytes, monocytes, NK-cells, T- and B-lymphocytes were serially isolated by flow-sorting for TTV analysis in 19 patients. The virus was undetectable in most cell types, but was identified in granulocytes in all instances, revealing a median DNA copy number increase of 1.8 logs between days +30-100 post-transplant. Our data therefore provide evidence for TTV replication in granulocytes in this setting. In a control cohort of immunocompetent children and in HSCT recipients before day +30, TTV positivity in granulocytes was less common (33%), and the copy numbers were considerably lower. However, rising TTV replication about 2 weeks after granulocyte engraftment (> 500 cells/mu l) was observed suggesting that granulocyte recovery might be required for TTV expansion in severely immunosuppressed transplant recipients.

Due to an important diversity, the comprehensive characterization of this viral family over time has been poorly studied. To overcome this challenge, we used a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach with the aim of determining the individual anellovirus profile of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) patients. We conducted a prospective pilot study on a homogeneous patient cohort regarding the chemotherapy regimens that included 10 ASCT recipients. A validated viral mNGS workflow was used on 108 plasma samples collected at 11 time points from diagnosis to 90 days post-transplantation. A complex interindividual variability in terms of abundance and composition was noticed. In particular, a strong sex effect was found and confirmed using quantitative PCR targeting torque teno virus, the most abundant anellovirus. Interestingly, an important turnover in the anellovirus composition was observed during the course of the disease revealing a strong intra-individual variability. Although more studies are needed to better understand anellovirus dynamics, these findings are of prime importance for their future use as biomarkers of immune competence.

Drug-induced immunosuppression following kidney transplantation is crucial to prevent allograft rejection, but increases risk for infectious disease. Tailoring of drug dosing to prevent both rejection and infection is greatly desirable. The apathogenic and ubiquitous torque teno virus (TTV) reflects immunocompetence of the host and might be a potential candidate for immunologic monitoring.Methods. To assess TTV as an infection biomarker, virus load was prospectively quantified in peripheral blood of 169 consecutive renal allograft recipients at the Medical University Vienna.Results. Patients with infection showed higher TTV levels compared to patients without infection (4.2 x 10(8) copies/mL [interquartile range, IQR, 2.7 x 10(7)-1.9 x 10(9)] vs 2.9 x 10(7) [IQR 1.0 x 10(6)-7.2 x 10(8)]; P =.006). Differences in TTV load became evident almost 3 months before infection (median 77 days, IQR 19-98). Each log level of TTV copies/mL increased the odds ratio for infection by 23% (95% confidence interval 1.04-1.45; P =.014). TTV > 3.1 x 10(9) copies/mL corresponded to 90% sensitivity to predict infections. Logistic regression demonstrated independent association between TTV levels and infection.Conclusions. TTV quantification predicts infection after kidney transplantation and might be a potential tool to tailor immunosuppressive drug therapy.

Renal impairment is a common complication after liver transplantation (LT). While BK polyomavirus (BKV) has been linked to renal failure in kidney transplant recipients, Torque teno virus (TTV) is a surrogate marker for immunosuppression that does not have a clear association with any human disease. The impact of BKV and TTV on renal impairment after LT is unknown.Methodology. In this retrospective study, urine and serum samples from 136 liver transplant recipients were screened for BKV and TTV by quantitative PCR. In addition, serum was screened for BKV-specific antibodies and the VP1 typing region was sequenced for BKV genotyping. All parameters were correlated with clinical data.Results/Key findings. BK viruria was detected up to 21 years after transplantation in 16.9% of cases. BK viraemia was detected in 8.7% of patients with BK viruria up to 4 years after LT. BKV-specific antibodies were detected in 93.6% of all LT recipients and correlated with BKV viral load in urine. There was no correlation between renal impairment and the detection of BK DNA in urine (OR 0.983). TTV DNA was detected in 84.6% of serum samples and in 66.6% of urine samples. The TTV viral load in serum correlated with the BKV viral load but had no impact on renal impairment.Conclusion. Our data indicate that the detection of BKV and TTV is not a risk factor for renal impairment after LT. A correlation of TTV and BKV viral load seems to be an indicator for the immune status of the host.

TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a were detected in 23 (37.7%) and 13 (21.3%) pigs, respectively, including mixed infection in five animals. By nucleotide sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, significant genetic diversity was observed among both TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a on St. Kitts, with TTSuVk2a showing higher genetic diversity than TTSuV1. Fourteen (45.2%) and 10 (32.2%) of the TTSuV infected pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine parvovirus (PPV), respectively, revealing high rates of co-infection of TTSuV with PCV2 and PPV. This is the first report on detection and genetic diversity of TTSuV from the Lesser Antilles. Also, PCV2 and PPV were detected for the first time in the Lesser Antilles. Considering the impact of pig farming on the regional livestock economy, the increasing demand for local pork and lack of information on emerging and re-emerging porcine viruses in the Lesser Antilles, the present findings have important implications on swine health.

This work aimed to investigate the presence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a in Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-infected and non -infected domestic pigs and free-living wild boars from Uruguay. Our data evidenced a high frequency of detection and a wide circulation of TTSuV among pig herds and wild boar populations. Furthermore, TTSuV1 + TTSuVk2a co-infection was more frequent than single infections in domestic pigs. In addition, we thoroughly characterized at the molecular level TTSuV strains by extensive sequence data analysis. Our findings revealed an extremely high genetic heterogeneity among Uruguayan isolates. On the basis of detailed analyses, we proposed a more comprehensive criterion of TTSuV classification which would contribute to shedding light over the genetic diversity of these viruses worldwide. On the other hand, data obtained suggested that neither TTSuV1 nor TTSuVk2a frequency of infection or viral loads have any correlation with PCV2 infection, health status or age. The role of TTSuV during co-infection with other pathogens and the age-related dynamics of TTSuV infection are currently under debate. Therefore, taking into account the controversial epidemiological data regarding these viruses and their ubiquitous infection, a likely role as components of the host microbiota should be brought into discussion.

To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it.														2045-2322	2045-2322	10.1038/s41598-018-31554-8																		P	BCI:BCI201800802726				Infectious genomic DNA clone and serological profile of torque teno sus virus 1 and 2		Meng, Xiang-Jin; Huang, Yaowei				US 10067130					Official Gazette of the United States Patent and Trademark Office Patents		2018	SEP 4 2018												The present invention also provides infectious DNA clones, biologically functional plasmid or viral vector containing the infectious nucleic acid genome molecule of Torque teno sus virus (TTsuV).

TTV is by far the first known single-stranded circular DNA virus infecting human. In spite of its widespread nature in human population, its pathogenesis is still unclear. In addition, information regarding TTV infection in Iranian population is limited. Therefore, we attempted to determine the prevalence and genotype of TTV in three groups: HIV/HBV patients, chronic hepatitis B patients, and healthy individuals. Methods: The presence of TTV DNA in sera was investigated using PCR. The primer sets encompassing two 5'-UTR and N22 regions were used, and the positive products were collected for sequencing. Phylogenetic tree was generated based on N22 region and using the MEGA 7 software. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 452 patients with HIV/HBV and chronic hepatitis B, as well as in healthy control groups. The results from PCR indicated positive rates for these three groups, 48%, 54%, and 49.3% using 5'-UTR primer and 15.1%, 12%, and 8% using N22 primer, respectively. Conclusion: Five genogroups were observed, which the second group was found to be the most frequent. The results of 5'-UTR primer showed more prevalence of TTV DNA comparing to N22 primer in patients and healthy control.														1028-852X	2008-823X	10.29252/ibj.22.5.338																		J	BCI:BCI201800774877	29727487			Kinetics of torque teno virus DNA load in saliva and plasma following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation		Albert, Eliseo; Torres, Ignacio; Talaya, Alberto; Gimenez, Estela; Luis Pinana, Jose; Carlos Hernandez-Boluda, Juan; Focosi, Daniele; Macera, Lisa; Maggi, Fabrizio; Solano, Carlos; Navarro, David (david.navarro@uv.es)									Journal of Medical Virology		2018	SEP 2018	90	9	1438-1443	1438	1443							Plasma torque teno virus (TTV) DNA load directly correlates with the degree of T-cell immune reconstitution early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Here, the kinetics of oral TTV DNA shedding was examined to assess whether quantitation of TTV DNA load in saliva may either replace or complement that in plasma for predicting lymphocyte (ALC) reconstitution after engraftment. This prospective observational study enrolled 38 nonconsecutive allo-HSCT recipients. Saliva and plasma specimens were collected at baseline (pretransplant) and at around days +30, +50, and +90 after allo-HSCT. TTV DNA was quantitated in both specimen types by real-time PCR. ALCs were measured by cytometry. A total of 104 paired saliva and plasma specimens were available for TTV PCR analyses. TTV DNA was detected more frequently in saliva than in plasma specimens at all time points (overall, 94.2% vs 86.5%). Increasing levels of TTV DNA were seen in both specimen types from day +30 to day +90 after transplantation. Overall, TTV DNA loads were significantly higher in saliva than in plasma specimens (P=.0002) and correlated significantly (P.0001). A direct correlation between TTV DNA loads in saliva and plasma and ALCs was observed after engraftment (P=.034 and P=.002, respectively). Future studies should be aimed at determining whether monitoring of oral TTV DNA shedding may be of any utility for inference of immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT.

We performed a prospective clinical trial using a high-dose zinc oral supplementation to improve the immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT).Patients and methods: We enrolled 18 patients undergoing autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma. Nine patients were randomized to receive only a standard antimicrobial prophylaxis; whereas, nine patients received in addition 150 mg/day of zinc from day +5 to day +100 after transplant.Results: CD4+ naive lymphocytes and TRECs showed a significant increase from day +30 until day +100 only in the zinc-treated group. Moreover, the load of Torquetenovirus, a harmless virus that replicates in course of immunedepression, increased at day +100 only in the control group.

However, using pig organs in humans poses risks including unwanted cross-species transfer of viruses and adaption of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome studies in mammals. Specifically, the ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new hosts and cross-species barriers. Pig-associated ssDNA viruses include torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV) in the Anelloviridae family, porcine parvoviruses (PPV), and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV) both in the family of Parvoviridae, and porcine circoviruses (PCV) in the Circoviridae family, some of which have been confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig-associated ssDNA viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed.

The demographics of patients receiving a lung transplant have evolved with older, more critically ill patients and those with previously contraindicated indications, now becoming recipients. Despite the lack of new classes of maintenance immunosuppression drugs becoming available, advances have been made in the prescribing of traditional immunosuppressive therapies. Developments in immunosuppressive regimens have seen changes in the route of administration, approaches to monitoring and combinations used. Long-term complications of immunosuppression, such as nephrotoxicity and malignancy can limit the success of lung transplantation, and strategies have evolved in recent years to minimise their long-term impact. Although survival outcomes have been steadily improving, chronic lung allograft dysfunction remains a barrier to long-term success. However, treatments for antibody-mediated rejection are emerging as a potential new therapeutic target to decrease the incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction. This article provides an update on the current status of immunosuppression after lung transplantation and reviews the evidence for immunosuppressive regimens and the implications for practice.

Methods Partial DNA sequences of TTSuV1 (JN688927) and TTSuV2 (AY823991) genomes were synthesized according to the two sequences in GenBank, and inserted into vector pUC57. The constructed recombinant plasmids were used as templates for TTSuV1 gene fragment at a length of 316 bp and TTSuV2 gene fragment at a length of 252 bp by PCR. The PCR assay was verified for sensitivity and specificity, by which Vero, KMB17, MRCS, Hep2 and BT cells, two batches of 0. 1% trypsin, three batches of virus harvests of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine made from Sabin strain (SIPV), one hatch of final product of SIPV, one batch of final product of hepatitis A (live) vaccine, freeze-dried (fHAV), and one batch of final product of inactivated enterovirus type 71 vaccine (EV71) were tested. Results The minimum detection limits of developed PCR assay for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were 10 and 0. 01 fg / mu L respectively. Specific TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genes were amplified by the developed PCR assay. No TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 DNAs were found in two batches of trypsin, Vero, KMB17, MRCS, Hep2 and BT cells as well as six hatches of vaccines. Conclusion A PCR assay for TTSuV raw materials and cells for vaccine production as well as harvest and final product of vaccine was successfully developed, which showed high sensitivity and specificity, and might be used for the determination of TTSuV in vaccine production in Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College.														1004-5503	1004-5503																			J	BCI:BCI201800640084	29625161			Development of a TaqMan-based real-time PCR assay for the rapid and specific detection of pigeon torque teno virus		Wan, Chunhe (chunhewan@126.com) ; Chen, Cuiteng; Cheng, Longfei; Fu, Guanghua; Shi, Shaohua; Fu, Qiuling; Liu, Rongchang; Chen, Hongmei; Huang, Yu (huangyu_815@163.com)									Molecular and Cellular Probes		2018	JUN 2018	39		53-56	53	56							Pigeon torque teno virus (PTTV), a recently discovered circular DNA virus.

Virology Journal		2018	MAY 30 2018	15		Article No.: 96	96								Background: Torque teno virus is a small chronically persisting circular negative ssDNA virus reaching near 100% prevalence. It is reported to be a marker for immune function in immunocompromised patients. The possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission remains controversial but incidence rate of TTV DNA in children increased with age. TTV dynamics well studied for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a predictor of post-transplant complications but there is no viral proliferation kinetics data for other patient groups or healthy individuals. The aim of this study was to determine TTV dynamics during the first year of life of healthy infants.Methods: Ninety eight clinically healthy breastfeeding infants (1-12 months of age) were analyzed by quantitative PCR for the whole blood TTV load with the test sensitivity of about 1000 viral copies per milliliter of blood (total number of samples including repeatedly tested infants was 109).Results: 67% of all analyzed samples were TTV-positive demonstrating significant positive correlation between age arid UV load (r = 0.81, p < 0.01).Conclusions: This is the first study to suggest that viral load increases during the first year of life reaching a plateau after 6 months with strong proliferation for the first 60 days. Our data well correlates with TTV dynamics in patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

The present study aimed to investigate the presence of HHpgV-1 in hemophilia patients. A total of 436 serum samples were investigated for the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1), torque teno virus (TTV), and HHpgV-1. Out of the 436 patients, 163 (37.4%), 19 (4.4%), 76 (17.4%), and four (0.9%) patients were positive for HCV, HPgV-1, TTV, and HHpgV-1, respectively. HHpgV-1 patients had a mean viral load of 4.9 +/- 0.3 log RNA copies/mL and were co-infected with HCV-1a, HPgV-1, and TTV. Moreover, three HHpgV-1-positive patients exhibited stage F0 liver fibrosis. HCV viral load in HHpgV-1-positive patients was lower than those of HHpgV-1-negative patients. Results also revealed that co-infection of HHpgV-1 with HPgV-1 and HCV may play a protective role in patients with chronic HCV. In conclusion, we detected a low frequency of HHpgV-1 infection in hemophilia patients, and results suggested that HHpgV-1 infection was correlated with the presence of other blood-borne viruses and is likely to also correlate with low HCV viral load and reduced severity of liver disease. Additional studies are required to further investigate the clinical importance of HHpgV-1.

Science of the Total Environment		2018	MAR 2018	616		669-677	669	677							Microbiological safety of reclaimed water is one of the most important issues in managing potential health risks related to wastewater recycling. Presence and removal of human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), human torque teno virus (HTtV) and somatic coliphage family Microviridae in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in sub-tropical Brisbane, Australia was investigated. All three WWTPs employ activated sludge process with added on Bardenpho process for nutrient removal. HPyV, HAdV, HTtV and Microviridae were consistently detected in the influent (10(5) to 10(6) Genomic copies (GC) L-1) and secondary treated effluent (10(2) to 10(3)GC L-1). The results of this study suggest that, under appropriate conditions, WWTPs with activated sludge process in sub-tropical climate could be an effective treatment barrier with > 3 log(10) removal of enteric virus. The geometric mean of pooled data for each virus from all sites showed the highest removal for HPyV (3.65 log(10)) and lowest for HAdV (2.79 log(10)) which was statistically significant (p = 0.00001). Whereas, the removal rate of HTtV and Microviridae was identical (2.81 log(10)). A poor correlation between the presence of enteric virus in influent or effluent with routinely monitored physicochemical parameters suggests limited use of physicochemical parameters as predictors of enteric virus presence. High prevalence of HAdV in influent and effluent combined with comparatively low removal suggest that it could be used as a model microorganism for determining enteric virus removal efficacy. Additional tertiary treatment may be required prior to effluent reuse for non-potable purposes or discharge into the recreational waters to prevent exposure of people to health hazards.

A total of 500 individuals (250 HCV positive patients and 250 healthy controls) were selected. DNA was extracted from serum samples and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region of TTV was performed. Out of 500 samples 9 HCV positive index cases (3.6%) and 8 healthy samples (3.2%) were found to be positive for TTV. A comparison was made between TTV sequences reported from all over the world with the ones obtained in the present study by sequencing of TTV positive samples followed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum parsimony (MP) method. Our results indicated that the virus was undergoing divergent evolution as very high sequence diversity was found in the ORF1 gene. The study also shows that association between HCV and TTV was not found. Because the virus was found to be affecting both healthy individuals and HCV infected population with almost same frequency. Therefore a thorough screening of TTV virus at the population level is required in order to draw a comprehensive inference.

This study aimed to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to characterize the viral diversity in respiratory samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. We have investigated 86 respiratory samples received from various hospitals in Kuwait between 2015 and 2016 for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. A metagenomic approach using the next-generation sequencer to characterize viruses was used. According to the metagenomic analysis, an average of 145, 019 reads were identified, and 2% of these reads were of viral origin. Also, metagenomic analysis of the viral sequences revealed many known respiratory viruses, which were detected in 30.2% of the clinical samples. Also, sequences of non-respiratory viruses were detected in 14% of the clinical samples, while sequences of non-human viruses were detected in 55.8% of the clinical samples. The average genome coverage of the viruses was 12% with the highest genome coverage of 99.2% for respiratory syncytial virus, and the lowest was 1% for torque teno midi virus 2. Our results showed 47.7% agreement between multiplex Real-Time PCR and metagenomics sequencing in the detection of respiratory viruses in the clinical samples. Though there are some difficulties in using this method to clinical samples such as specimen quality, these observations are indicative of the promising utility of the metagenomic sequencing approach for the identification of respiratory viruses in patients with respiratory tract infections.

While the pathogenic potential of TTVs is under debate, recent experimental studies in gnotobiotic pigs indicate that swine TFVs, TTSuV1 in particular, can act as a primary or co-infecting pathogen. Hence, determining whether TTSuV1 can infect other mammals would eventually further our understanding of viral pathogenesis, especially in co-infections. In this study, we tested sera from horses, cattle, sheep, dogs and elk for the presence of TTSuV1 DNA using a panel of TTSuVl-specific primers, and assessed the extent of sero-conversion to TTSuV1 in the selected species. We found that TTSuV1 DNA was detected in 46.7% of equines, 70% of canine, 100% of bovine, 40% of ovine and 93.3% of elk samples. However, significant TTSuV1 specific antibody responses were detected only in the bovine, ovine and equine samples but not the canine or elk samples, indicating that these animals could support the replication of TTSuV1. This combined serological and molecular epidemiological profile of TTSuV1 infection in five different species indicates the host range of species-specific TTVs could be wider than initially believed. Further studies are required to understand the health risks to these animal species from TTSuV-1 infection.

Little is known about single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that are associated with these ectoparasites. As part of a pilot study to identify ssDNA viruses present in ticks, female American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) and blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) were collected in eastern Pennsylvania (USA), and the extracted viral DNA was analyzed using viral metagenomics approaches. Three genomoviruses were recovered from pooled samples of D. variabilis (n = 2) and I. scapularis (n = 1): two belonging to the genus Gemycircularvirus, sharing < 63% pairwise identity with other members within the genus; and the third belonging to the genus Gemykolovirus, sharing < 70% pairwise identity to other gemykoloviruses. Furthermore, a genome of an anellovirus belonging to the sharing 62-65% nucleotide identity with torque teno canis viruses (genus Thetatorquevirus) was also recovered from a D. variabilis pooled sample.

We investigated whether the early kinetic pattern of plasma TTV DNA load after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) associates with subsequent CMV and EBV DNAemia. This study included 71 allo-HSCT patients. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) for log(10) TTV DNA loads quantified by days 20 and 30 after transplantation (TTV DNA load AUC(20-30)), was significantly lower (P = 0.036) in patients who subsequently developed CMV DNAemia requiring preemptive antiviral therapy (n = 17) than in those who did not (n = 8) or had no CMV DNAemia (n = 19). Patients displaying TTV DNA load AUC(20-30) <= 2.8 copies x days x mL(-1) were more likely to have high-level CMV DNAemia. A trend towards a direct correlation between TTV DNA AUC(20-30) and CMV-specific interferon-gamma CD8+ T-cell counts by day +30 was noted (P = 0.095). However, this dynamic parameter was not useful for anticipating the occurrence of either CMV recurrences (n = 12) or EBV DNAemia (n = 34). In summary, it may be possible to identify a subset of allo-HSCT patients at a high risk of developing high-level CMV DNAemia by analyzing the kinetics of plasma TTV DNA load early after engraftment.

It is likely that this fraction contains novel viruses, but identification is challenging since they frequently lack homology to known viruses. To overcome this problem, we developed a strategy to detect ORFan protein families in shotgun metagenomics data, using similarity-based clustering and a set of filters to extract bona fide protein families. We applied this method to 17 virus-enriched libraries originating from human nasopharyngeal aspirates, serum, feces, and cerebrospinal fluid samples. This resulted in 32 predicted putative novel gene families. Some families showed detectable homology to sequences in metagenomics datasets and protein databases after reannotation. Notably, one predicted family matches an ORF from the highly variable Torque Teno virus (TTV). Furthermore, follow-up from a predicted ORFan resulted in the complete reconstruction of a novel circular genome. Its organisation suggests that it most likely corresponds to a novel bacteriophage in the microviridae family, hence it was named bacteriophage HFM.

Ian; Fajgenbaum, David C.									Blood		2017	DEC 7 2017	130	Suppl. 1	3589	3589								Castleman disease (CD) describes multiple distinct and heterogeneous disorders defined by common lymph node histopathology, including atrophic or hyperplastic germinal centers, prominent follicular dendritic cells, hypervascularization, polyclonal lymphoproliferation, and/or polytypic plasmacytosis. Unicentric CD (UCD) involves a solitary lymph node station that displays CD histopathology, whereas multicentric CD (MCD) involves multiple regions of enlarged nodes. Most UCD patients do not experience systemic symptoms and are successfully treated by removal of the enlarged node. In contrast, MCD involves constitutional symptoms, cytopenia, hepatosplenomegaly, fluid accumulation, cytokine storm-associated multiple organ system dysfunction, and is often fatal. In 1994, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) was identified as the etiological driver of MCD in immunocompromised individuals. However, approximately 50% of MCD patients are HHV-8 negative (idiopathic MCD (iMCD)). Its idiopathic nature limits targeted treatment for iMCD patients who do not respond to anti-Interleukin-6 therapy. iMCD is itself heterogeneous, and recent work has identified at least one distinct sub-population of iMCD patients with a severe clinical presentation featuring thrombocytopenia, anasarca, myelofibrosis, renal dysfunction, and organomegaly (iMCD-TAFRO). Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of iMCD and UCD, all of which remain untested. One notable hypothesis entertains that iMCD and UCD are in fact driven by viral infection--either HHV-8 that is not detected by current diagnostic methods, a novel virus, or a known but unanticipated virus. In support of the last possibility, there are several case reports of associations with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HHV-6 and Hepatitis B virus (HBV); however, neither a systematic study of known viruses, nor a search for novel viruses in CD has been reported.To this end, we employed Virome Capture Sequencing for Vertebrate Viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT),-a RNA-hybrid capture, deep sequencing and bioinformatics pipeline designed for viral discovery. In accordance with the Treaty of Helsinki, we obtained freshly frozen lymph node tissue from patients with iMCD (n=11) and UCD (n=12) as experimental conditions. HHV-8-positive MCD (n=2) was included as a positive control for HHV-8 infection. Lymph nodes from patients with lymphoma without clinical suspicion of HHV-8 infection (n=6) and an additional reactive lymph node were included as a negative control. HHV-8 was only detected in HHV-8-positive MCD and not in iMCD or UCD, consistent with prior clinical testing. Additionally, we did not identify any previously unknown viruses in iMCD or UCD lymph node tissue. Members of the herpesviridae family, including EBV, HHV-6 and HHV-7, were found in all conditions. Interestingly, in iMCD, the identification of herpesviridae family members was associated with relapsing disease and the more clinically severe iMCD-TAFRO variant. Additional numerous associations of unclear significance were made with viruses such as Human Endogenous Retrovirus Type K (HERV-K), transfusion transmitted virus/Torque teno virus (TTV), and Pegivirus.To investigate the significance of the EBV infection, we analyzed the number of EBV positive cells by in situ hybridization on lymph node tissue from a separate cohort of patients with CD and related disorders. The mean number of Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBER) positive cells/high-powered fields (HPF) across 10 HPF was significantly lower in UCD (2 +/- 2.3; n=9) and iMCD (1.7 +/- 2.8; n=12) than in HHV-8 positive MCD (106.5 +/- 75.6; n=2) and EBV-associated lymphoproliferation (63.5 +/- 54.4; n=2) (p < 0.005 for all comparisons). The only iMCD-TAFRO case in this cohort had 4 EBER-positive cells/HPF. Further study is needed with larger cohorts of patients to validate the prognostic and potentially pathogenic significance of these associations, and in particular, the association of EBV and other herpesviridae family members with iMCD-TAFRO.

There is a need for improved diagnostics that can quickly and accurately detect a broad range of viruses, bacteria, and fungi that can infect these patients to guide targeted therapy.Methods: We enrolled 20 patients in a prospective study evaluating the Karius plasma next-generation sequencing (plasma NGS) test to detect infections in allo-SCT patients. Nine patients received myeloablative conditioning and 11 underwent reduced intensity conditioning. All patients were free of known active infections at the initiation of the transplant conditioning regimen. Patients had baseline plasma samples drawn prior to transplant followed by weekly collections during engraftment and at onset of febrile episodes. Samples were transferred to the Karius CLIA/CAP laboratory (Redwood City, CA) where cell-free DNA was extracted from plasma and NGS performed. Human sequences were computationally removed and remaining reads were aligned against a curated pathogen database. Genomic evidence of organisms present at a significance level above a predefined threshold were reported.Results: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was identified in 12/20 patients overall, and 12/16 CMV IgG seropositive patients. Using a nearest-neighbor method, 61 pairs of observations were identified for a comparison of plasma NGS and CMV qPCR collected within one day of each other. Positive agreement (PPA) between plasma NGS and CMV qPCR was 84.1% (37/44). PPA was 100% (20/20) when values below the lower limit of quantitation (<137 IU/ml) for CMV qPCR were excluded. In addition to CMV, plasma NGS detected EBV (5/20 patients), HHV-6B (4/20 patients), BK virus (4/20 patients) and Torque teno viruses (4/20 patients), with 9 subjects experiencing co-infections. Nine subjects had co-infections with two or more viruses. Plasma NGS also detected pathogens prior to conventional tests being ordered in two patients with subsequently confirmed acute infections; Staphylococcus aureus was detected one day prior to blood culture in one patient and Chlamydia trachomatis 30 days prior to targeted testing in a second patient. These two cases highlight the potential of plasma NGS to detect pathogens in SCT patients early when used as a monitoring tool.Conclusions: Karius has developed a novel NGS plasma test that can simultaneously identify pathogens in allo-SCT patients. The test had 100% concordance with CMV qPCR above the lower level of quantitation. Further work is ongoing to determine the lower limits of detection for the plasma NGS test. Using NGS to monitor SCT patients for infection could permit earlier detection of pathogens, enabling earlier targeted therapy for selected pathogens and preemption of clinical infection sequalae in this vulnerable population.														0006-4971	1528-0020																			J	BCI:BCI201800130835	28866831			Detection of a new species of torque teno mini virus from the gingival epithelium of patients with periodontitis		Zhang, Yu; Li, Fei; Chen, Xi; Shan, Tong-Ling (shantongling@shvri.ac.cn) ; Deng, Xu-Tao; Delwart, Eric; Feng, Xi-Ping (fxiping1808@qq.com)									Virus Genes		2017	DEC 2017	53	6	823-830	823	830							We describe a novel species of torque teno mini virus called TTMV-204, which was isolated from the gingival epithelium of patients with periodontitis and characterized using viral metagenomics. The sequence of the full genome is 2824 nt in length. Phylogenetic analysis and genetic analyses show classic Betatorquevirus species organization with less than 40% amino acid similarity in ORF1. The prevalence of TTMV-204 in the periodontitis patient population was 18.75% (15/80), which was higher than in periodontally healthy individuals (10.00%, 10/80). However, the difference of the TTMV-204 prevalence between two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.115). Further investigation is required to determine whether this new virus is associated with inflammation.														0920-8569	1572-994X	10.1007/s11262-017-1505-4																		J	BCI:BCI201800175395	29047018			Identification of a novel torque teno mini virus in cerebrospinal fluid from a child with encephalitis		Kang, Yan-Jun; Zhou, Mei-Fang; Huang, Wei; Deng, Chao; Yan, Gen (gyan@stu.edu.cn) ; Lu, Zhong-Hua (Lu_z_h@126.com)									Virologica Sinica		2017	DEC 2017	32	6	541-544	541	544							Anelloviruses are single-strand circular DNA viruses and ubiquitous within the human population. Although there is no direct evidence, many studies have suggested the anelloviruses may be associated with a variety of diseases. In this study, a novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was detected in a child with unexplained encephalitis. The detected virus had a circular genome of 2943 nt in length and 3 open reading frames. It shared 45.4% - 35.9% nucleotide identities with known TTMV species and < 35% with the other species of anellovirus, which suggested it might belong to a new species within the genus Betatorquevirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of ORF1 showed that this virus represented a distinct branch within the diversity of anellovirus. Whether this novel anellovirus strain is associated with encephalitis requires further study.														1674-0769	1995-820X	10.1007/s12250-017-4042-3																		J	BCI:BCI201800080149	27878979			Prevalence of the Novel Torque Teno Sus Virus Species k2b from Pigs in the United States and Lack of Association with Post-Weaning Multisystemic Wasting Syndrome or Mulberry Heart Disease		Rogers, A.

(xjmeng@vt.edu)									Transboundary and Emerging Diseases		2017	DEC 2017	64	6	1877-1883	1877	1883							The family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno viruses, TTV) and other animals including swine (Torque teno sus viruses, TTSuV). Two genetically distinct TTSuV species have been identified from swine thus far (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), although their definitive association with disease remains debatable. In 2012, a novel TTSuV species was identified from commercial swine serum and classified in the genus Kappatorquevirus as TTSuVk2b. The other Kappatorquevirus species, TTSuVk2a, has been associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) when coinfected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Therefore, in this study, we initially amplified a portion of TTSuVk2b ORF1 and, subsequently, assessed the molecular prevalence of the virus in pigs in the United States. A total of 127 serum and 115 tissue samples were obtained from pigs with PMWS or mulberry heart disease (MHD) in six states and tested by PCR for the presence of TTSuVk2b DNA. Approximately 27.6% of the serum and 21.7% of tissue samples tested positive for TTSuVk2b DNA, and the positive products were confirmed by sequencing. However, we did not detect a correlation between TTSuVk2b infection and PMWS or MHD. The near full-length genomic sequence of US TTSuVk2b was determined, and sequence analysis revealed that the US TTSuVk2b isolates were 95% identical to the TTSuVk2b isolate from Spain, with most of the variations clustering in ORF1. We conclude that the novel TTSuVk2b species is present in pigs in the United States and its potential association with a disease warrants further investigation.

Nucleotide sequencing of HBV S region was further performed.Results: OBI and TTV infection were detected in 5 (3.3%) and 68 (45%) patients, respectively. HBV isolates were classified into genotypes A (4/5, 80%) and D (1/5, 20%), and no HBsAg escape mutation was observed. TTV phylogenetic group 3 was the most prevalent among both HCC and non-HCC patients. OBI and TTV infection were significantly more frequent in patients with HCC than patients without HCC (p = 0.003, and p = 0.009, respectively). Moreover, TTV infection was associated with HCC (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.04-4.80, p = 0.040), independently of liver cirrhosis.Conclusions: A low prevalence of OBI was observed in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, and TTV infection was an independent factor associated with the occurrence of HCC. Whether TTV influences the progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C patients remains to be elucidated.

However, the first year post-transplantation is often complicated by infections and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Improvements in immunological monitoring could reduce such post-transplant complications. Torque Teno virus (TTV), a chronically persisting DNA virus, is reported to be a marker for immune function in immunocompromised patients. In the present study, the TTV kinetics were analyzed to investigate the potential role of TTV viremia as immune-competence read-out after allo-HSCT. Twenty-three monocentric allo-HSCT recipients were retrospectively tested for TTV-DNA in whole blood at given day post-transplant. Dynamics of TTV viremia was analyzed with respect to episodes of non-TTV viral reactivations (CMV, EBV, and BKPyV), acute GVHD, and recovery of immune cells. Recipients affected by persisting viral infections and/or GVHD during the first 100 days after allo-HSCT showed a significantly higher median TTV load at day +30 than patients with a less complicated clinical course (p = 0.005). This was also associated with a total lymphocyte count <5.5E+08 cells/L in this high-risk group (p = 0.039). These findings suggest that TTV could represent an additional parameter to identify patients at higher risk for complications in the first 100 days following allo-HSCT. Prospective studies, including the monitoring of lymphocyte subsets, are required to define the potential use of TTV in immunological monitoring after allo-HSCT.														0300-8584	1432-1831	10.1007/s00430-017-0511-4																		J	BCI:BCI201700696464	28527409			Molecular characterization of pigeon torque teno virus (PTTV) in Jiangsu province		Zhang, Zhicheng (andzzc@126.com) ; Dai, Wei; Dai, Dingzhen									Computational Biology and Chemistry		2017	AUG 2017	69		10-18	10	18							The torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently discovered DNA virus that has been detected in many different hosts, including humans, livestock and poultry. To date, there is no report of pigeon TTV, (PTTV) from anywhere in the world. To investigate the distribution of PTTV in pigeons from the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu and characterize their genomes, we employed PCR to detect PTTV in 144 samples collected from 6 pigeon plants in Jiangsu province, amplify complete genomes from representative samples and analyze genetic characteristics using bioinformatics. The results demonstrated that 71.5% (103/144) of samples were PTTV positive. The rate of sequence homology among the six PTTV complete genomes obtained from Jiangsu province ranged from 99.7% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that PTTV genomes had a high degree of genetic similarity and were similar to chicken anemia virus that also had poultry as a host. Although with the same host, PTTV shared distant relationship with PiCV in both complete genome, Rep and Cap genes. The results of this study provided evidence that PTTV could be detected in Chinese pigeons at a high level, the evolutionary process of complete genome, Rep and Cap genes of Anelloviridae family had obvious divergence.

To evaluate the relationship with PCVAD, 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were used to detect both Iotatorquevirus species by nested PCR and sequencing. Sixty-eight PCVAD cases were selected as well as 32 porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) non-affected cases. Overall, 33 of the 100 cases were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a and 8 of 100 were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1b. Only 24 of 68 (35%) PCVAD cases were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a; 39% (9/23) of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, and 33% (15/45) of PCV2-associated reproductive failure cases. Among PCV2 non-affected cases, 28% were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a and 6% were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1b. Torque teno sus virus 1b was not detected in PCV2-associated reproductive failure cases. Regardless of the PCV2-status, a lower frequency of both Iotatorquevirus species was found than depicted in other reports and there was no statistical relationship with PCVAD (x(2) < 0.01). Given the worldwide genomic variability of Iotatorquevirus species, it is feasible that species prevalent in Mexico share a lower nucleotide sequence identity, leading to different pathogenic potential.

The present study aimed to identify the presence of TTCaV in blood samples obtained from domestic dogs, and examine its diversity and evolution of the genomes. Five strains of TTCaV were detected, and the overall prevalence was found to be 7% (28/400). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the five genomes were closely clustered with the previously known Cf-TIV10 and LDL strains and formed a Thetatorque virus. Homology analysis of the whole genome showed a sequence identity of 94.6%-96.8% among the five genomes. The percent sequence similarity among the five complete genomes ranged from 95.3% to 97.4% and from 95.1% to 97% compared to the Cf-TTV10 and LDL strains respectively. The ORF1-encoded amino acid sequences showed 94.4%-97.2% identity among the five isolates. Our findings suggest that the TTCaV has a large genetic diversity and showed that TTCaV and canine parvovirus (CPV) co-infection exists in China. Further studies on the pathogenicity of TrCaV are required.														0168-1656	1873-4863	10.1016/j.jbiotec.2017.05.003																		J	BCI:BCI201800635040				Molecular Diagnostic Evaluation of Post-surgical Endophthalmitis		Yue, Bryan; Lee, Cecilia S.; Kasi, Sundeep; Hong, Bryan; Akileswaran, Lakshmi; Baughman, Doug; Lee, Aaron Y.; Garg, Sunir; Van Gelder, Russell N.									IOVS		2017	JUN 2017	58	8	4255	4255								Purpose : To characterize the viral pathogens found in post-surgical endophthalmitis with whole genome sequencing (WGS) and polymerase chain reaction (PCR).Methods : Patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis following intraocular procedures were recruited from Wills Eye Hospital and University of Washington from Sept 1st, 2014 to Dec 31st, 2015. All patients underwent vitreous or aqueous tap. The specimens were sent for microbial culture and additional PCR and WGS. Following DNA extraction, quantitative PCR for Torque Teno Virus (TTV), Merkel Cell Polyomavirus (MCV), and actin were performed in all samples. WGS results were analyzed by Scalable Metagenomics Alignment Research Tool (SMART). PCR results were verified via gel electrophoresis.Results : A total of 30 samples were collected (12 culture-positive (40%), 14 culture-negative (47%), 4 unknown). WGS confirmed 100% of the bacterial culture results (12/12) and revealed substantial amounts of Staphylococcus in 2 culture-negative samples. In addition, the WGS results allowed de novo genomic reconstruction of pathogens in several samples with high specificity. Overall, 20 (66.66%) samples were positive for TTV and 15 (50%) for MCV. The presence of TTV or MCV was not associated with culture positivity by Fisher's exact test.Conclusions : Viral DNA sequences are unexpectedly common in endophthalmitis. The role of these viruses in this disease process remains unclear. WGS and de novo reconstruction of pathogen's genome may become a useful technique in pathogen detection in endophthalmitis.

We studied 60 episodes of respiratory symptoms in 71 lung transplant patients. Almost half of these episodes were of unknown infectious etiology despite extensive routine diagnostic testing.MethodsWe re-analyzed respiratory samples of all episodes with undetermined etiology in order to detect potential viral pathogens missed/not accounted for in routine diagnostics. Respiratory samples were enriched for viruses by filtration and nuclease digestion, whole nucleic acids extracted and randomly amplified before high throughput metagenomic virus sequencing. Viruses were identified by a bioinformatic pipeline and confirmed and quantified using specific real-time PCR.ResultsIn completion of routine diagnostics, we identified and confirmed a viral etiology of infection by our metagenomic approach in four patients (three Rhinovirus A, one Rhinovirus B infection) despite initial negative results in specific multiplex PCR. Notably, the majority of samples were also positive for Torque teno virus (TTV) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). While TTV viral loads increased with immunosuppression in both throat swabs and blood samples, HHV-7 remained at low levels throughout the observation period and was restricted to the respiratory tract.ConclusionThis study highlights the potential of metagenomic sequencing for virus diagnostics in cases with previously unknown etiology of infection and in complex diagnostic situations such as in immunocompromised hosts.

Several studies report mother-to-child postnatal transmission of TTV in infancy but the risk of transplacental transmission of TTV is still unclear.Methods: The blood and plasma collected postpartum from 100 mother-child pairs were analyzed using TTV-specific qPCR. Samples were collected from the peripheral vein of the mother and the umbilical cord.Results: Eighty four percent of pregnant women were TTV positive (median titers: 8 x 10(4) copies/mL; range: 10(3) - 3 x 10(7)). The TTV load in plasma was approximately 100 times lower than in whole blood. TTV was not detected in any of cord blood samples.Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the lack of transplacental transmission of TTV (or effective prenatal inhibition of viral proliferation). The presence of the virus in infants may be associated with mother-to-child transmission through breast feeding or other routes of transmission.

With a broad spectrum activity, antimicrobial peptides have been considered potential antibacterial drug leads. Using bioinformatic tools we have previously shown that viral structural proteins are a rich source for new bioactive peptide sequences, namely antimicrobial and cell-penetrating peptides. Here, we test the efficacy and mechanism of action of the most promising peptides among those previously identified against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Two cell-penetrating peptides, vCPP 0769 and vCPP 2319, have high antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, MRSA, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, being thus multifunctional. The antibacterial mechanism of action of the two most active viral protein-derived peptides, vAMP 059 and vCPP 2319, was studied in detail. Both peptides act on both Gram-positive S. aureus and Gram-negative P. aeruginosa, with bacterial cell death occurring within minutes. Also, these peptides cause bacterial membrane permeabilization and damage of the bacterial envelope of P. aeruginosa cells. Overall, the results show that structural viral proteins are an abundant source for membrane-active peptides sequences with strong antibacterial properties.			Gomes, Paula A.

However, the prevalence and genotypic distribution of these viruses in the assessed patients undergoing hemodialysis remains unclear. The present study investigated these issues and the possibility of nosocomial transmission among patients undergoing hemodialysis in a unit in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. GBV-C RNA was detected in 92/161 patients (57.1%) by nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) classified the GBV-C isolates into genotypes 6 (85%), 2 (8%), 4 (6%), and 3 (1%). TTV DNA was detected in all patients by the amplification of the 5'-UTR and open reading frame-1 (ORF1) by nested and semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ORF1 revealed that genotype 1 was dominant (84%), followed by genotypes 2 (10%) and 3 (6%). The greater prevalence of GBV-C genotype 6 in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared with the general population and the identical sequences observed in multiple isolates provided strong evidence of patient-to-patient transmission. The prevalence of TTV in hemodialysis patients was similar to that observed in the general population, and only one pair of TTV isolates was identical. These results indicated that nosocomial infection was not the main cause of the high prevalence of TTV in patients undergoing hemodialysis. In conclusion, GBV-C and TTV infections are common in patients undergoing hemodialysis in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and transmission is likely to be nosocomial in the case of GBV-C infection.

Water was analyzed for viable F-specific DNA (F-DNA) and F-specific RNA (F-RNA) (genogroup I [GI] to GIV) coliphage and a suite of molecularly detected viruses (norovirus [GI to GIV], torque teno virus [TTV], rotavirus, kobuvirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis E). F-DNA and F-RNA coliphage were detected in 33 and 28% of the samples at maximum concentrations of 2,000 and 16,300 PFU . 100 ml(-1), respectively. Animal TTV, human TTV, kobuvirus, astrovirus, and norovirus GIII were the most prevalent viruses, found in 23, 20, 13, 12, and 11% of samples, respectively. Viable F-DNA coliphage was found to be a modest positive indicator of molecularly detected TTV. F-RNA coliphage, unlike F-DNA coliphage, was a modest positive predictor of norovirus and rotavirus. There were, however, a number of significant negative associations among F-specific coliphage and viruses. F-DNA coliphage densities of >142 PFU . 100 ml(-1) delineated conditions when similar to 95% of water samples contained some type of virus. Kobuvirus was the virus most strongly related to detection of any other virus. Land use had some associations with virus/F-specific coliphage detection, but season and surface water flow were the variables that were most important for broadly delineating detection. Higher relative levels of detection of human viruses and human F-RNA coliphage were associated with higher relative degrees of upstream human land development in a catchment.IMPORTANCE This study is one of the first, to our knowledge, to evaluate relationships among F-specific coliphages and a large suite of enteric viruses in mixed-use but agriculturally dominated surface waters in Canada. This study suggested that relationships between viable F-specific coliphages and molecularly detected viruses do exist, but they are not always positive. Caution should be employed if viable F-specific coliphages are to be used as indicators of virus presence in surface waters. This study elucidates relative effects of agriculture, wildlife, and human activity on virus and F-specific coliphage detection. Seasonal and meteorological attributes play a strong role in the detection of most virus and F-specific coliphage targets.														0099-2240	1098-5336	10.1128/AEM.02763-16																		J	BCI:BCI201700246067	27525643			Torque Teno Virus Load-Inverse Association With Antibody-Mediated Rejection After Kidney Transplantation		Schiemann, Martin; Puchhammer-Stoeckl, Elisabeth; Eskandary, Farsad; Kohlbeck, Philip; Rasoul-Rockenschaub, Susanne; Heilos, Andreas; Kozakowski, Nicolas; Goerzer, Irene; Kikic, Zeljko; Herkner, Harald; Boehmig, Georg A.; Bond, Gregor (gregor.bond@meduniwien.ac.at)									Transplantation (Hagerstown)		2017	FEB 2017	101	2	360-367	360	367							Background. Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) represents one of the cardinal causes of late allograft loss after kidney transplantation, and there is great need for noninvasive tools improving early diagnosis of this rejection type. One promising strategy might be the quantification of peripheral blood DNA levels of the highly prevalent and apathogenic Torque Teno virus (TTV), which might mirror the overall level of immunosuppression and thus help determine the risk of alloimmune response. Methods. To assess the association between TTV load in the peripheral blood and AMR, 715 kidney transplant recipients (median, 6.3 years posttransplantation) were subjected to a systematical cross-sectional AMR screening and, in parallel, TTV quantification. Results. Eighty-six of these recipients had donor-specific antibodies and underwent protocol biopsy, AMR-positive patients (n = 46) showed only 25% of the TTV levels measured in patients without AMR (P = 0.003). In a generalized linear model, higher TTV levels were associated with a decreased risk for AMR after adjustment for potential confounders (risk ratio 0.94 per TTV log level; 95% confidence interval 0.90-0.99; P=0.02). Conclusions. Future studies will have to clarify whether longitudinal assessment of TTV load might predict AMR risk and help guide the type and intensity of immunosuppression to prevent antibody mediated graft injury.

Omar									Intervirology		2017		60	3	102-108	102	108							Objective: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous virus that is commonly associated with blood transfusion. The main aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of TTV in polytransfused children with thalassemia and to determine for the first time the prevalent TTV genotypes in Egypt. Methods: TTV was detected in 2 groups by nested PCR: the first group comprised 200 children with thalassemia, and the second included age-and sex-matched healthy children with no history of blood transfusion. Results: TTV was detected in 60 and 57%, respectively, of the children with thalassemia and the healthy children. Among the TTV-positive children with thalassemia, 71.6% were HCV positive. No hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in the thalassemic children. Significant elevations of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were found in TTV-positive patients with thalassemia compared to TTV-negative patients. Phylogenetic analysis of sequenced TTV isolates showed close relationships to genotypes 1 and 2. Conclusion: TTV is highly prevalent among children with thalassemia in Egypt, with a relatively high infection rate also detected among healthy children. (C) 2017 S.

Infection with more than one type of viruses was common and significant in most of the positive patients (p < 0.05) and ranging from 55.4% for TTV/TTMV and TTMV/TTMDV co-infections in the healthy group, to 96.3% for TTV/TTMV co-infections in the HBV group. Further, and as with most previous studies, no significant association was found between anelloviruses infections and age, nationality, or gender (p > 0.05) albeit the detection of higher infection rates among females and Qatari subjects.Conclusion: This was the first published study to look at prevalence of Anellowviruses in the Middle East. High prevalence rates of the three viruses in all studied groups was noted. Further studies are needed to explore and compare the different genotypes of these viruses in the region.

The thymus atrophy occurring with ageing represents a limit for de novo T-cell reconstitution, although the reactivation of thymic function after BMT is documented. The proper strategy to improve the thymic output is currently matter of debate. Pre-clinical and clinical evidences suggest that Zinc oral supplementation may contribute to thymic reactivation and to improve the T-mediated cellular defense against pathogens. We tested the role of Zinc oral supplementation in immune reconstitution, using as model the autologous SCT in multiple myeloma.Methods: From January 2014 to May 2016, we prospectively enrolled 18 patients (12 male, 6 female; average age: 58 years, range 43-72) undergoing single MEL 100 or 200 auto-SCT after one or two lines of therapy (VTD, lyposomal anthracycline and lenalidomide) and stem cell collection (mobilizing therapy: cyclophosphamide 3 g/sqm and G-CSF). The trial, prospective and randomized, has been approved by local ethics committee (EUDRACT: 2014-004499-47). All patients undersigned the informed consent. The clinical trial was carried out in accordance with Helsinki declaration. Randomization was effected at day 0 (day of PBSC infusion).Results: nine patients were treated from day + 5 to day + 100 after transplant with 600 mg/day of Zinc sulfate (uncoated tablets), whereas nine patients received only standard antimicrobial prophylaxis. Peripheral blood samples were collected in both groups at day + 30 (t2) and day + 100 (t3). Eight-colour flow cytometry was performed for CD3, CD4, CD8, CD45RA, CD45R0, CD27, CD28, CD25, CD127, with specific gates to identify specific lymphocyte populations (T naive, T central memory, T effector memory, T terminal memory). The lymphocyte's population's count was statistically analysed intra-and inter-group TRECs was performed on lymphocytes isolated by peripheral blood. A qPCR for viral load of Torquetenovirus (TTV), a harmless virus whose viral load is related to immunodepression, was performed. Zinc serum level was measured. Results: The only significant difference in the clinical features between the 2 groups was the mean age (58 years in the control group, 63 years in the sample). The recovery of naive CD4 cells was visible in both groups from day + 30 to day + 100, but a significant increase was detected only in the Zinc group. Similarly, TRECs showed a significant increase in the treated group. CD8+ T cells showed a notable decrease until day 100 in the control group, specifically the CD8 naive, memory, and effector memory populations. TTV load in the control group increased in inverse proportion to the decrease of CD8 population. In the Zinc group there were no differences between the TTV loads at the two time points. As a result, the viral load of TTV was higher in the control group than in the Zinc group at day + 100. Zinc serum levels were normal in all patients.Conclusions: data show that Zinc plays a role in a faster recovery of TRECs and CD4 naive T cells after autologous transplantation. Furthermore, Zinc seems to prevent the expected CD8 decrease of the control group, thus probably explaining the TTV reactivation. Zinc-deficiency was not observed in any of the patient; however, a Zinc supplementation may contribute to a better T-cell reconstitution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study describing the role of Zinc after stem cell transplantation.[GRAPHICS].

The clinical significance of TTV infections in either humans or pigs is uncertain. In fact, TTV viremia is highly prevalent in patients with different pathologies, but it can also be frequently observed in healthy subjects. Virus infection in pigs is considered a putative cofactor in several diseases; despite being detected frequently in healthy animals, its role still remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in 62 bile samples collected from pigs at slaughterhouse and in 36 fresh pork liver sausages bought at point of sale. Quantitative Real-Time PCR, confirmed that 19.4 and 58.3 % of bile and sausage samples tested positive for TTSuV, respectively. The mean viral load was established as 5.6 x 10(4) GE/A mu l for bile and 7.16 x 10(3) GE/g for sausages. TTSuV nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed a wide heterogeneity among the circulating TTSuV strains, which included both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2.

In the present study, 257 swine plasma samples from 31 swine herds located in Brazil, were PCR screened for PCV-2 and TTSuV-1/2 and correlated with clinical data. PCV-2 was detected in 25%, followed by 38.1% and 42.4% of TTSuV-1 and TTSuV-2, respectively. Co-infections of two or three viruses were found in 32.3% of samples. PCV-2 was more frequently detected in the growing (p=0.030) and finishing phases (p=0.0005) while TTSuV-2 in the nursery (p =0.009). Only TTSuV-1 was statistically associated to clinical disease (multiple signs), in combination or not with PCV-2 or TTSuV-2 (p = 0.015). PCV-2/TTSuV co-infections were more frequently related to weight gain reduction in comparison to mono-infections (p = 0.049) and no-infections (p = 0.027), and also in animals with (p = 0.011) or without (p = 0.037) clinical signs, being the nursery the most affected phase (p=0.025). Our results uphold the pathogenic potential of TTSuV in naturally infected pigs and the clinical/economical impact of this agent, especially in co-infections. Studies addressing the physiopathological mechanisms of simultaneous infections are needed. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To characterize the ocular surface microbiome of healthy volunteers using a combination of microbial culture and high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques.METHODS. Conjunctival swab samples from 107 healthy volunteers were analyzed by bacterial culture, 16S rDNA gene deep sequencing (n = 89), and biome representational in silico karyotyping (BRiSK; n = 80). Swab samples of the facial skin (n = 42), buccal mucosa (n = 50), and environmental controls (n = 27) were processed in parallel. 16S rDNA gene quantitative PCR was used to calculate the bacterial load in each site. Bacteria were characterized by site using principal coordinate analysis of metagenomics data. BRiSK data were analyzed for presence of fungi and viruses.RESULTS. Corynebacteria, Propionibacteria, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were the predominant organisms identified by all three techniques. Quantitative 16S PCR demonstrated approximately 0.1 bacterial 16S rDNA/human actin copy on the ocular surface compared with greater than 10 16S rDNA/human actin copy for facial skin or the buccal mucosa. The conjunctival bacterial community structure is distinct compared with the facial skin (R = 0.474, analysis of similarities P = 0.0001), the buccal mucosa (R = 0.893, P = 0.0001), and environmental control samples (R = 0.536, P = 0.0001). 16S metagenomics revealed substantially more bacterial diversity on the ocular surface than other techniques, which appears to be artifactual. BRiSK revealed presence of torque teno virus (TTV) on the healthy ocular surface, which was confirmed by direct PCR to be present in 65% of all conjunctiva samples tested.CONCLUSIONS. Relative to adjacent skin or other mucosa, healthy ocular surface microbiome is paucibacterial. Its flora are distinct from adjacent skin. Torque teno virus is a frequent constituent of the ocular surface microbiome.

However, it has been constantly associated to hepatitis cases of unknown etiology (HUE) as well as extensively studied in concurrent infections with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1).In South America, TTV epidemiological data is scant, involving some studies from Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia.The aim of this work was to investigate for the first time in Uruguay the presence of TTV by a nested-PCR system in 85 human serum samples infected with HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV-1 and in HUE cases.Overall, our results reported a TTV infection rate of 79% (67/85). Furthermore, the molecular characterization of Uruguayan strains revealed that one of them clustered in genogroup 1, while the remaining ones formed separate clusters closely related to genogroup 3, which should be confirmed by complete genome sequencing.Further investigation about TTV circulation in Uruguayan population is needed in order to provide additional information about the genetic variability and TTV epidemiology in South America.

Following immunosuppression in kidney transplant patients, BK polyomavirus (BKV) has been shown to induce nephropathy (BKVN), decreasing graft survival. In this study we investigated the urine virome profile of BKV+ and BKV- kidney transplant recipients. Virus-like particles were stained to confirm the presence of VLP in the urine samples. Metagenomic DNA was purified, and the virome profile was analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. While the BK virus was predominant in the BKV+ group, it was also found in the BKV- group patients. Additional viruses were also detected in all patients, notably including JC virus (JCV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) and interestingly, we detected multiple subtypes of the BKV, JCV and TTV. Analysis of the BKV subtypes showed that nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the VP1, VP2 and Large T Antigen proteins, suggesting potential functional effects for enhanced pathogenicity. Our results demonstrate a complex urinary virome in kidney transplant patients with multiple viruses with several distinct subtypes warranting further analysis of virus subtypes in immunosuppressed hosts.

Comprehensive virus detection assays are desirable because viral pathogens have not been identified in many cases. We evaluated the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detecting viruses in clinical samples of encephalitis/encephalopathy patients. We first determined the sensitivity and quantitative performance of NGS by comparing the NGS-determined number of sequences of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) in clinical serum samples with the HHV-6 load measured using real-time PCR. HHV-6 was measured as it occasionally causes neurologic disorders in children. The sensitivity of NGS for detection of HHV-6 sequences was equivalent to that of real-time PCR, and the number of HHV-6 reads was significantly correlated with HHV-6 load. Next, we investigated the ability of NGS to detect viral sequences in 18 pediatric patients with acute encephalitis/encephalopathy of unknown etiology. A large number of Coxsackievirus A9 and mumps viral sequences were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 2 and 1 patients, respectively. In addition, Torque teno virus and Pepper mild mottle viral sequences were detected in the sera of one patient each. These data indicate that NGS is useful for detection of causative viruses in patients with pediatric encephalitis/encephalopathy.

IOVS		2016	SEP 2016	57	12	3864	3864								Purpose : Conjunctivitis is among the most common outpatient conditions and causes significant ocular morbidity worldwide. The most severe and common form of viral conjunctivitis is epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC), caused by certain strains of adenovirus (Ad). However, the geographic distribution of other Ad genotypes and the role of the ocular surface microbiome (OSM) in EKC have not been established. We investigated the worldwide distribution of Ad genotypes and the OSM associated with keratoconjunctivitis (KC).Methods : A variety of analyses were conducted on samples obtained in a large international clinical trial (NV-422 Phase IIB, NovaBay Pharmaceuticals, Inc). The inclusion criteria were clinical signs and symptoms consistent with KC and evidence of Ad using the rapid screening test (Rapid Pathogen Screening Inc., Saratosa, FL). Bilateral conjunctival swabs were obtained on day 1, 3, 6, 11, and 18. Ad genotype was determined by sequencing of Ad hexon gene (ViraCor-IBT Laboratories, Inc, Lee's Summit, MO) and the OSM was assessed using next generation sequencing (NGS) on selected samples. The difference in the distribution of Ad genotypes was assessed with Fisher exact.Results: Overall, 5000 samples were collected from 500 patients. 111, 200, 84, and 103 patients were recruited from US, India, Sri Lanka, and Brazil, respectively. Mean age was 35 and 58% were men. The most common Ad subgenera were subgroup D (316, 63%), followed by E, B, then C. A significant portion of patients (110, 22%) lacked PCR evidence of Ad infection. There was a significant geographic bias for Ad subgenera and serotype distribution (Fisher exact, p-value <10(-6)). The odds ratio (OR) of having serotype 4 vs. others in the US was 7.87 times higher than in non-US sites (95% CI 3.55, 17.35), while the OR of having serotype 8 vs. others in the US was significantly lower (0.01, 95% CI 0.003, 0.043). Among the samples that underwent NGS, Ad was the dominant virus in 10 of 16 Ad-positive samples, while there was no consistent, dominant virus in 16 Ad-negative samples. Two Ad-negative samples contained significant amounts of torque teno virus.Conclusions : This study reveals unexpected geographic diversity in Ad genotypes associated with KC, and suggests that nearly one fourth of apparently viral KC may be due to agents other than adenovirus.This is an abstract that was submitted for the 2016 ARVO Annual Meeting, held in Seattle, Wash., May 1-5, 2016.

To determine whether TTSuVs downregulate key host immune responses to facilitate their own survival, a swine macrophage cell line, 3D4/31, was used to over-express recombinant TTSuV1 viral particles or the ORF3 protein. Immune gene expression profiles were assessed by a quantitative PCR panel consisting of 22 immune genes, in cell samples collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-transfection. Despite the upregulation of IFN-beta and TLR9, interferon stimulated innate genes and pro-inflammatory genes were not upregulated in virally infected cells. The adaptive immune genes, IL-4 and IL-13, were significantly downregulated at 6 h post-transfection. The ORF3 protein did not appear do not have a major immuno-suppressive effect, nor did it stimulate anti-viral immunity.

Fifty-one % were positive for PCV2, 7% for PRRSV, 22% for TTSuV1, 48% for TTSuV2, 6% for B. b., 29% for M. h., and 21% for P. m. In 38.2% only viral, in 3.6% only bacterial and in 40.0% both, viral and bacterial pathogens were detected. In 29.1% of the cases a co-infection with 1 pathogen, in 28.2% with 2, in 17.3% with 3, and in 7.3% with 4 different infectious agents were observed. The exposure to Pneumocystis significantly decreased the risk of a co-infection with PRRSV in weaning piglets; all other odds ratios were not significant. Four categories of results were compared: I = P. spp. + only viral co-infectants, II = P. spp. + both viral and bacterial co-infectants, III = P. spp. + only bacterial co-infectants, and IV = P. spp. single infection. The evaluation of all samples and the age class of the weaning piglets resulted in a predomination of the categories I and II. In contrast, the suckling piglets showed more samples of category I and IV. In the group of fattening pigs, category II predominated. Suckling piglets can be infected with P. spp. early in life.

Recent reports indicate that swine torque teno viruses (TTSuVs) can act as primary pathogens or play a role in exacerbating co-infections. However, very little is known about the TTSuV host-viral interaction or how they so successfully establish chronic infections in the host. To determine whether the major viral proteins can modulate host immunity, recombinant TTSuV1 ORF1 and 2 proteins were expressed in a swine macrophage cell line (3D4/31). The differential expression of a panel of innate, adaptive, regulatory and inflammatory immune genes was studied by quantitative PCR; using cDNA samples collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-transfection. The ORF1 protein induced an early anti-viral response. However, at 6 h post-transfection it also upregulated IL-10, PD-1 and SOCS-1, the suppressors of T cell mediated immunity. An ensuing diminishment of the early protective response was noted. The TTSuV1 ORF2 protein suppressed IFN-beta and IL-13 responses but did not significantly influence anti-viral immunity otherwise. These findings indicate that the TTSuV1 ORF1 protein plays a significant but dual role in viral immunity. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Human TTV's are epidemiologically associated with several human disease conditions such as respiratory illnesses, auto-immune disorders and hepatitis. Recently it was found that swine TTV's (TTSuVs) can act as primary pathogens. The common occurrence of TTVs as environmental contaminants and the increasing interest in the use of swine organs for xenotransplantation lend importance to the question of whether TTV's can cross-infect across species. In this study, we examined human and swine sera by swine or human TTV-specific PCRs, to determine whether swine TTVs (TTSuV) DNA can be detected in humans and vice versa. Surprisingly, both human and TTSuV DNA were present in a majority of the samples tested. Transfection of human PBMC's with TTSuV1 genomic DNA resulted in productive viral infection which was sustained for the three serial passages tested. Lymphoproliferative responses in infected human PBMCs were diminished when compared to the controls. Furthermore, mild to moderate antibody responses against the TTSuV1 ORF2 protein was detected in 16 of the 40 human sera by ELISA. Therefore, these study findings provide initial and fundamental evidence for possible cross-species transmission of TTVs.

It has been detected in eastern Taiwan indigenes with a low prevalence of 11% by using N22 region of which known to underestimate TTV prevalence excessively. In order to clarify their realistic epidemiology, we re-analyzed TTV prevalence with UTR region. One hundred and forty serum samples from eastern Taiwanese indigenous population were collected and TTV DNA was detected in 133 (95%) samples. Direct sequencing revealed an extensive mix-infection of different TTV strains within the infected individual. Entire TTV open reading frame 1 was amplified and cloned from a TTV positive individual to distinguish mix-infected strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed eleven isolates were clustered into a monophyletic group that is distinct from all known groups. In addition, another our isolate was clustered with recently described Hebei-1 strain and formed an independent clade. Based on the distribution pattern of pairwise distances, both new clusters were placed at phylogenetic group level, designed as the 6th and 7th phylogenetic group. In present study, we showed a very high prevalence of TTV infection in eastern Taiwan indigenes and indentified new phylogenetic groups from the infected individual. Both intra-and inter-phylogenetic group mix-infections can be found from one healthy person. Our study has further broadened the field of human TTVs and proposed a robust criterion for classification of the major TTV phylogenetic groups.

Open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of TTSuV1 can be transcribed into mRNA and then translated into protein; however, its promoter has not yet been identified. We used a dual-luciferase reporter system, involving pGL3-Basic and pRL-TK, to identify the promoter of TTSuV1 ORF1. Our results revealed that the sequence between nucleotides 196 and 525 promoted the transcription of the firefly luciferase gene. The core sequence of the promoter was between nucleotides 250 and 400. A comparison of the identified TTSuV1 ORF1 promoter with that from cytomegalovirus (CMV) suggested that the two promoters were similar in strength.

We also wished to determine the TTV genotypes in HNCC patients. Methods: A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the N22 region of the TTV genome, as well as direct sequencing of PCR fragments, was used. Results: TTV prevalence was higher in HNCC patients (saliva: 27/71, 38%; tumor biopsy: 22/74, 30%) than in controls (saliva: 8/56, 14%; oral mucosa: 1/19, 5%). TTV prevalence was also high in patients with premalignant lesions of oral carcinoma (saliva: 9/18, 50%; biopsy: 5/21, 24%). By phylogenetic analysis, TTV belonging mostly to genotypes 1 and 2 was found in HNCC patients. In most of the cases, identical TTV strains were present in the biopsy and salivary sample of the same HNCC patient. In addition, the same TTV strain was detected in 2 laryngeal carcinoma biopsies obtained from 2 independent patients. Conclusions: Our data are compatible with the idea that TTV might act as a cocarcinogen in certain cases of HNCC. Alternatively, HNCC may facilitate either TTV replication or TTV entry into the saliva. (C) 2016 S.

Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types is strongly associated with the development of oropharyngeal carcinoma, and Epstein-Ban- virus appears to be indispensable for the development of non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Other viruses including torque teno virus and hepatitis C virus may act as co-carcinogens, increasing the risk of malignant transformation. A shift in the composition of the oral microbiome was associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, although the causal or casual role of oral bacteria remains to be clarified. Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a mutagenic compound, by members of the oral microflora as well as by fungi including Candida albicans and others is a potential mechanism that may increase oral cancer risk. In addition, distinct Candida spp. also produce NBMA (N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine), a potent carcinogen. Inflammatory processes elicited by microbes may also facilitate tumorigenesis in the head and neck region.														0065-2598(print)		10.1007/5584_2015_5005	978-3-319-26319-9(H); 978-3-319-26320-5(P)																	S	BCI:BCI201800881052				Advances in Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Public Health, Vol 1					Donelli, G						Advances in Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Public Health, Vol 1	Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology	2016		897											This 124-page book in English titled " Advances in Microbiology, Infectious Diseases and Public Health " is volume 897 in the series " Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology ".

The present study intended to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV based on its correlations with the histopathological changes, various common concurrently infected viral pathogens including porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine parvovirus (PPV), as well as changes in the distribution and population of host immunocytes such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages by using the superficial inguinal lymph nodes (siLNs) of wasting pigs. A tissue microarray consisting of 270 available siLNs collected from 262 clinically wasting and 8 healthy pigs, respectively, were used for the detection of TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PCV2, PRRSV, and PPV by either in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and for the detection of various subsets of immunocytes by IHC staining with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79a, and lysozyme. The slides were then subject to digital scanning followed by a semi-quantitative positive pixel evaluation for further statistical analysis. Although a high prevalence of TTSuV1 and/or TTSuV2 infection was noted in both wasting and healthy pigs, the wasting pigs had a significantly higher intensity in both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 ISH-positive signals than healthy ones did. In the wasting pigs, a significant positive correlation in the tissue viral load was noted between TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 and between TTSuV2 and PCV2, but not between TTSuV1 and PCV2. Conversely, a significant negative correlation in the tissue viral load was revealed between TTSuV2, but not TTSuV1, and PRRSV. The tissue viral load of TTSuV1 was significantly correlated with B cell hyperplasia, while the tissue viral load of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated with increased macrophage population. The ISH positivity of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated with lymphoid depletion and granulomatous inflammation, which are the characteristic histopathological findings in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected pigs. These findings suggest that both TTSuV species may have the potential involving the development of porcine circovirus-associated lymphoid lesions via alternating the host immune system.

Nested-polymerase chain reaction was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers to detect TTMDV/SAV DNA. Serum aminotransferases were measured.Results: In the HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HIV, and control cases, 29 (80.5%), 3 (75%), 43 (82.7%), and 16 (14.5%) were positive for DNA of TTMDV/SAV, respectively. In the HIV/HCV infected cases and HIV positive cases the level of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly different in TTMDV/SAV infected and non-infected individuals (P > 0.05).Conclusions: Although significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed in the frequency of TTMDV/SAV between healthy controls and each of the HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, no significant difference was observed between HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected cases, which may be due to HIV associated immunodeficiency. This is the first time that TTMDV/SAV is reported in HIV infected individuals worldwide.

Currently, little is known about swine immune response against TTSuV infections. In this study, an ELISA assay was developed based on the ORF1-A recombinant protein of two known TTSuVs, namely TTSuV1 (genus lotatorquevirus) and TTSuV2 (genus Kappatorquevirus). The assay was used to study the development of the humoral immune response against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in longitudinally sampled clinically healthy pigs and their dams. Anti ORF1-A IgG was found in serum of pigs and sows for both TTSuVs. From 15 sows, 15 (100%) and 13 (83%) had anti ORF1-A IgG against TTSuV1 and ITSuV2, respectively. Pig sero-prevalences at the first sampling (4 weeks of age) were 65% (24/37) and 5% (2/37) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. For TTSuV1, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at weeks 21 and 25, with 68% (25/37) sero-positive pigs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results at week 21 revealed that 26 out of 32 (81%) pigs were positive for TTSuVl. In the case of TTSuV2, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at week 21, with 84% (31/37) pigs being sero-positive. At the same week, 92% (34/37) of pigs were qPCR positive. In summary, anti ORF1-A IgGs were detected in both sows and piglets at different ages, indicating that these animals could mount a humoral immune response against both TTSuVs. However, the high percentage of viremic pigs in presence of anti ORF1-A IgG suggests that these antibodies are not able to remove TTSuVs from circulation. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas, antibodies against PRRSV or CSFV showed no statistical significance on comparison with anti-TTSuV1b antibody, implicating that in conventional pigs, the antibody level for PRRSV and CSFV were not significantly influenced by TTSuV1b infection.Conclusion: In conclusion, examination of anti-TTSuV1b antibody in porcine serum with the presently established ELISA method would serve as a supplementary approach for etiological investigation, and the combined statistical analysis of the antibodies against four other viruses might help to further understand the TTSuV1b infection as well as its pathogenicity.															1743-422X	10.1186/s12985-015-0349-6																		J	BCI:BCI201600113347	26246630			Disease risks associated with free-ranging wild boar in Saskatchewan		McGregor, Glenna F.; Gottschalk, Marcelo; Godson, Dale L.; Wilkins, Wendy; Bollinger, Trent K.

Whole carcasses, tissue samples, and/or serum from 81 hunter-killed boars from Saskatchewan were submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) between 2009 and 2014. Serological tests were negative for PRRS, H1N1, and H3N2 swine influenza, PCV-2, and TGE/PRCV in 22/22 boars and for Toxoplasma gondii and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 20/20 boars. Of 20 boars whose sera were tested 20 were positive for Actin bacillus pleuropneumoniae, with 7 positive for, among other strains, serotype 14; 16 were positive for Lawsonia intracellularis, 1 was positive and 6 were suspicious for Salmonella spp: Polymerase chain reaction tests were negative for PRRS and PCV2 in 58/58 boars and positive for Torque teno virus in 1/8 boars. Digestion assays were negative for Trichinella spp. in 22/22 boars. The high seroprevalence of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 14 is noteworthy as this serotype has not been previously reported in North America.

Currently, no studies have been performed comparing simultaneously viral loads of TTSuVs and PCV2. To examine the role for TTSuVs in PMWS-affected animals, a SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) was designed to detect and quantify TTSuV1, TTSuV2 and PCV2 genomes in swine sera. TTSuV1 genome loads were significantly higher in healthy adults than in young and SPF animals (p < 0.05) suggesting that the prevalence of TTSuV1 infection increases with age and bears no association with PMWS. Regarding TTSuV2, no significant variation was detected in viral loads within any of the groups. As expected, PCV2 genome loads were higher in PMWS-affected swine than in healthy or SPF animals (p < 0.001). These findings provide clear evidence to indicate that neither TTSuV1 nor TTSuV2 viral loads have any correlation with the occurrence of PMWS. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Four species have been found to infect swine, namely Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) 1a and 1b (TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b; genus lotatorquevirus), TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b (genus Kappatorquevirus). TTSuV infection in pigs is distributed worldwide, and is characterized by a persistent viremia. However, the real impact, if any, on the pig health is still under debate. In the present study, the impact of pig immunization on TTSuVk2a loads was evaluated. For this, three-week old conventional pigs were primed with DNA vaccines encoding the ORF2 gene and the ORF1-A, ORF1-B, and ORF1-C splicing variants and boosted with purified ORF1-A and ORF2 Escherichia coli proteins, while another group served as unvaccinated control animals, and the viral load dynamics during natural infection was observed. Immunization led to delayed onset of TTSuVk2a infection and at the end of the study when the animals were 15 weeks of age, a number of animals in the immunized group had cleared the TTSuVk2a viremia, which was not the case in the control group. This study demonstrated for the first time that TTSuV viremia can be controlled by a combined DNA and protein immunization, especially apparent two weeks after the first DNA immunization before seroconversion was observed. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind this and its impact for pig producers. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was detected recently in swine, but its epidemiology and pathology remain unclear. A TagManbased real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting a conserved region of the ORF3 gene of PPV4 was developed. The qPCR detection limit was 9.5 x 10(1) DNA copies/mu L. There was no cross-reaction with porcine parvovirus, torque teno virus 1, torque teno virus 2, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine circovirus type 2, or with pseudorabies virus. Two hundred and seventy-two samples, including serum, semen, lungs, feces, ovarian follicular fluids, ovaries and uterus, were evaluated by qPCR and PPV4 was detected in 36 samples (13.2%). When compared with a conventional PCR (cPCR), the qPCR assay was 10 times more sensitive and the detection of PPV4 DNA in field samples was increased 2.5 times. Partial sequencing of PPV4 ORF3 gene, obtained from two pooled samples of uterus and ovaries, revealed a high nucleotide identity (98-99%) with a reference PPV4 sequence. The qPCR can be used as a fast and accurate assay for the detection and quantification of PPV4 in field samples and for epidemiological studies in swine herds. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The goal of this study was to estimate the infection rates and genotypic characteristics of TTV in the State of Qatar. A total of 644 blood samples representing different nationalities: (i) Qatari (118) and (ii) non-Qatari (526) nationals (mostly from Arab and South Eeast Asia countries) were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by nested PCR. The majority (573) of the blood samples belonged to healthy blood donors, whereas 54 and 53 of the blood samples belonged to patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. The results obtained showed that the TTV infection rates in the healthy blood donors, and those infected with HBV or HCV patients were 81.4, 90.75 and 84.9%, respectively. Significant association between TTV viremia and age, or nationality was observed. Sequence analysis of PCR fragments amplified from the 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) of all (531) TTV positive samples showed that 65.5% (348/531) of the PCR fragment sequences were classified into main genogroup 3, followed by main genogroups 5 (24%), 2 (5.8%), and 1 (4.7%). Genogroup 4 was not detected among the our studied subjects. Phylogenetic and pairwise analyses using sequences from TTV viremic samples also showed an overall close similarity to the main genogroup 3. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in the rates of TTV detection among Qataris and non-Qataris and several genotypes, mainly genotype 3, were isolated. J. Med.

The role of the ocular surface microbiome in DES has not been established. This study investigated the 16S-bacterial and viral load of torque teno virus (TTV) in patients with DES and their clinical correlations.Methods: Patients with clinical diagnosis of DES and controls were recruited from the University of Miami and Miami Veterans A airs Healthcare. All underwent full exam including corneal fluorescein staining, Schirmer, tear break-up time (TBUT), and ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire. Conjunctival swabs were analyzed by qualitative and quantitative PCR. Analyses were performed with Wilcoxon signed rank and Spearman correlation tests. Multivariate regression and logistic regression models were used to analyze the contribution of each variable to the total 16S load and the status of DES.Results: A total of 71 eyes of 37 patients (22 with DES and 15 controls) were included. Mean age was 63.6 in the DES group and 47.7 in the control group (p-value 0.0005). There were 20 males (91%) in the DES group and 12 (80%) in the control group. Between eye correlation was measured using the intraclass correlation coeffcient (ICC=0.520). Median level of 16S bacteria (normalized to human actin copies) were 0.034 in the DES patients and 0.120 in the controls (p-value 0.005). There was a negative correlation between the total 16S bacteria and the OSDI score (rho -0.526, p-value<0.0001). Similar negative correlation was observed between the total 16S bacterial load and the staining score (rho -0.373, p-value 0.003). Both Schirmer score and TBUT positively correlated with 16S load (rho 0.464, p-value 0.0002 and rho 0.402, p-value 0.002, respectively). The multivariate regression model that included age, OSDI, TBUT, corneal stain, and Schirmer was significant (p-value 0.001, adjusted R-2=0.28) in predicting total 16S. The most significant variable was the OSDI. The logistic regression model that included age, gender, TTV, and 16S showed that both TTV and 16 loads negatively correlated with DES status (OR: 0.025, 0.002, respectively).Conclusions: This study highlights the disruption of the normal ocular surface microbiome and potentially infectious role in DES. Decreased level of 16S bacterial load and TTV correlated significantly with DES. Whether this relationship is correlative or causative remains to be determined.

Conventional culture techniques have failed to identify the composition and to characterize the diversity of these communities because a majority of these microbes are unculturable. In this study, we sought to characterize the ocular surface bacterial community in healthy subjects by using 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing on the Illumina platform.Methods: Conjunctiva samples of the upper and lower fornices of both eyes were collected using forensic DNA recovery swabs from 35 healthy volunteers. Along with appropriate negative control samples, the conjunctiva samples underwent DNA extraction, library preparation, and 16S rRNA gene deep sequencing on the Illumina platform. Quantitative PCR for Torque Teno Virus (TTV) was also performed. Data were analyzed in R.Results: Sequencing resolution to the genus and species levels were obtained for 140 conjunctiva samples from 35 healthy volunteers. Propionibacterium acnes, Arthrospira fusiformis, Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum, Enterobacter hormaechei, and Chryseobacterium indologenes were the most abundant species across all samples. Principal component analyses showed that the genera responsible for the majority of the variance across all conjunctiva samples were Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and Staphylococcus. TTV was detected in 63% of the patients (17/27). Subgroup analyses revealed that the TTV load was statistically higher in men compared to women (0.012 TTV copy/epithelial cell +/- 0.0028 TTV copy/epithelial cell vs. 0.001 TTV copy/epithelial cell +/- 0.0006 TTV copy/epithelial cell, mean +/- SEM, p = 0.0078).Conclusions: The ocular surface microbiome bacterial composition in healthy volunteers is diverse. The variability across samples is largely determined by Corynebacterium, Propionibacterium, and Staphylococcus. Low TTV levels are found in the majority of the samples and TTV viral load is dependent on gender. Future experiments using unbiased next-generation sequencing to characterize the bacterial, fungal, and viral composition of the ocular surface will further our understanding of ocular infectious and inflammatory diseases.

This study identified the presence of TTV and its genome groups in blood samples from 118 patients in dialysis and 50 renal-transplant recipients. The research was conducted in a hospital in the city of Maringa, state of Parana. The viral DNA, obtained from whole blood, was identified by using two nested Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR). The frequencies of TTV were 17% and 36% in dialysis patients using the methodology proposed by Nishizawa et al.

Elevated TTV levels are observed after solid organ transplantation and are related to the extent of immunosuppression especially during the phase of maintenance immunosuppression. However, the extent to which the TTV increase in the early phase post-transplantation is associated with the patient's immunosuppressive state is unclear.ObjectivesIn this study, we assessed the TTV increase dynamics in detail during the first three months after lung transplantation under a defined immunosuppressive regimen and in relation to the pre-transplant TTV level.Study DesignForty-six lung transplant recipients (LTRs) were included in this prospective longitudinal study. All received alemtuzumab induction combined with tacrolimus and corticosteroids immunosuppressive therapy. Plasma TTV DNA was monitored before transplantation and regularly within the first three months post-transplantation (n = 320 samples; mean sampling interval: 12.2 days).ResultsIn 43/46 LTRs (93%), TTV DNA was detectable before transplantation (median 4.4 log(10) copies/mL; range: 2.0-6.4). All 46 LTRs showed a TTV increase post-transplantation, which followed a sigmoidal-shaped curve before the median peak level of 9.4 log(10) copies/ mL (range: 7.6-10.7) was reached at a median of day 67 (range: 41-92). The individual TTV DNA doubling times (range: 1.4-20.1 days) significantly correlated with the pre-transplant TTV levels calculated over 30 or 60 days post-transplantation (r = 0.61, 0.54, respectively; both P < 0.001), but did not correlate with the mean tacrolimus blood levels. Pre-transplant TTV levels were not associated with time and level of the patients' post-transplant TTV peak load.ConclusionThe TTV level may be used to mirror the state of immunosuppression only after the patients' initial peak TTV level is reached.

This hypothesis is based on the higher prevalence of TT Virus infection in patients with leukemia compared with controls.Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of TT Virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections in patients with leukemia and healthy controls.Patients and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 95 patients with leukemia and 100 healthy controls who were admitted to the Namazi Hospital affiliated to the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, were enrolled between years 2012 and 2013. Blood samples treated with EDTA were collected from each patient with leukemia and controls. The existence of TT Virus infection was analyzed using the semi-nested PCR method. The immunological prevalence of HBV and HCV infections were evaluated using HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab ELISA based protocols, respectively. Active CMV infection was also evaluated using an immunofluorescence method. Also risk factors of leukemia and viral infections were statistically analyzed in patients with leukemia.Results: The TT Virus infection was significantly found in 40 of 95 (42.1%) and 12 of 100 (12%) patients with leukemia and controls, respectively. The HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab were detected in 27 of 95 (28.4%) and 18 of 69 (26.1%) patients with leukemia but were not found in the controls. Active CMV infection was also found in 11 of 69 (16%) patients and none of the controls. Significant co-infection of TT Virus was found with HBV (15 of 40; 37.5%), HCV (14 of 40; 35%) and CMV (7 of 40; 17.5%) in patients with leukemia.Conclusions: Confirmation of the significantly higher frequency of TT Virus, HBV, HCV and CMV single infection and their co-infection in patients with leukemia compared with healthy controls, emphasizes the determinative role of TT Virus pathogenesis in clinical outcomes observed in patients with leukemia, which requires extensive evaluation by further studies.			ramzi, mani/AAZ-7660-2020											2008-3645	2008-4161	10.5812/jjm.8(4)2015.18212																		J	BCI:BCI201500339343	25680568			Human anelloviruses: an update of molecular, epidemiological and clinical aspects		Spandole, Sonia (sonia.spandole@gmail.com) ; Cimponeriu, Danut; Berca, Lavinia Mariana; Mihaescu, Grigore									Archives of Virology		2015	APR 2015	160	4	893-908	893	908							Human torque teno viruses (TTVs) are new, emerging infectious agents, recently assigned to the family Anelloviridae.

These viruses are characterized by an extremely high prevalence, with relatively uniform distribution worldwide and a high level of genomic heterogeneity, as well as an apparent pan-tropism at the host level. Although these viruses have a very high prevalence in the general population across the globe, neither their interaction with their hosts nor their direct involvement in the etiology of specific diseases are fully understood. Since their discovery, human anelloviruses, and especially TTV, have been suggested to be associated with various diseases, such as hepatitis, respiratory diseases, cancer, hematological and autoimmune disorders, with few arguments for their direct involvement. Recent studies have started to reveal interactions between TTVs and the host's immune system, leading to new hypotheses for potential pathological mechanisms of these viruses. In this review article, we discuss the most important aspects and current status of human TTVs in order to guide future studies.

(russvg@u.washington.edu)									Ophthalmology		2015	MAR 2015	122	3	524-530	524	530							Purpose: To test the hypothesis that uncultured organisms may be present in cases of culture-negative endophthalmitis by use of deep DNA sequencing of vitreous biopsies.Design: Single-center, consecutive, prospective, observational study.Participants: Aqueous or vitreous biopsies from 21 consecutive patients presenting with presumed infectious endophthalmitis and 7 vitreous samples from patients undergoing surgery for noninfectious retinal disorders.Methods: Traditional bacterial and fungal culture, 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and a representational deep-sequencing method (biome representational in silico karyotyping [BRiSK]) were applied in parallel to samples to identify DNA sequences corresponding to potential pathogens.Main Outcome Measures: Presence of potential pathogen DNA in ocular samples.Results: Zero of 7 control eyes undergoing routine vitreous surgery yielded positive results for bacteria or virus by culture or 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 14 of the 21 samples (66.7%) from eyes harboring suspected infectious endophthalmitis were culture-positive, the most common being Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species. There was good agreement among culture, 16S bacterial PCR, and BRiSK methodologies for culture-positive cases (Fleiss' kappa of 0.621). 16S PCR did not yield a recognizable pathogen sequence in any culture-negative sample, whereas BRiSK suggested the presence of Streptococcus in 1 culture-negative sample. With the use of BRiSK, 57.1% of culture-positive and 100% of culture-negative samples demonstrated the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) sequences, compared with none in the controls (P = 0.0005, Fisher exact test). The presence of TTV viral DNA was confirmed in 7 cases by qPCR. No other known viruses or potential pathogens were identified in these samples.Conclusions: Culture, 16S qPCR, and BRiSK provide complementary information in presumed infectious endophthalmitis. The majority of culture-negative endophthalmitis samples did not contain significant levels of bacterial DNA. "Culture negativity" does not seem to be due to failure of growth of fastidious bacteria. The small DNA virus TTV was unexpectedly found in all culture-negative samples and some culture-positive samples. This study cannot distinguish whether TTV is a direct intraocular pathogen, an adjuvant for inflammation, a general marker of inflammation, or a commensal virus but provides a testable hypothesis for a pathogenic mechanism in culture-negative endophthalmitis.

[Methods] Based on a Chinese TTSuV2 strain from Guangdong province, two overlapped virus proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli. Then, purified recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins were used as the antigens in the Western Blotting and ELISA assay. [Results] The recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins were identified with the special tag monoclonal antibody. The results of the ELISA tests shown that there were significant relationships between two groups of dates from the recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins antigenic assay. The results of the following Western Blotting assay indicated that the TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies were contained in pig sera. [Conclusion] The truncated TTSuV2 ORF1a protein (positions 168 to 346 corresponding to TTSuV2 GDIMA1) contains important B cell epitopes which can stimulate immune system antibody secretion. The truncated TTSuV2 ORF1a protein could be effective in TTSuV2 immunodiagnosis.														0001-6209																				J	BCI:BCI201600093304	25861745			Bacteriophage and their potential roles in the human oral cavity		Edlund, Anna; Santiago-Rodriguez, Tasha M.; Boehm, Tobias K.; Pride, David T. (dpride@ucsd.edu)									Journal of Oral Microbiology		2015		7		Article No.: 27423	27423								The human oral cavity provides the perfect portal of entry for viruses and bacteria in the environment to access new hosts. Hence, the oral cavity is one of the most densely populated habitats of the human body containing some 6 billion bacteria and potentially 35 times that many viruses. The role of these viral communities remains unclear; however, many are bacteriophage that may have active roles in shaping the ecology of oral bacterial communities. Other implications for the presence of such vast oral phage communities include accelerating the molecular diversity of their bacterial hosts as both host and phage mutate to gain evolutionary advantages. Additional roles include the acquisitions of new gene functions through lysogenic conversions that may provide selective advantages to host bacteria in response to antibiotics or other types of disturbances, and protection of the human host from invading pathogens by binding to and preventing pathogens from crossing oral mucosal barriers. Recent evidence suggests that phage may be more involved in periodontal diseases than were previously thought, as their compositions in the subgingival crevice in moderate to severe periodontitis are known to be significantly altered. However, it is unclear to what extent they contribute to dysbiosis or the transition of the microbial community into a state promoting oral disease. Bacteriophage communities are distinct in saliva compared to sub- and supragingival areas, suggesting that different oral biogeographic niches have unique phage ecology shaping their bacterial biota. In this review, we summarize what is known about phage communities in the oral cavity, the possible contributions of phage in shaping oral bacterial ecology, and the risks to public health oral phage may pose through their potential to spread antibiotic resistance gene functions to close contacts.

Journal of Water and Health		2015		13	3	777-789	777	789							Bacterial indicator organisms are used globally to assess the microbiological safety of waters. However, waterborne viral outbreaks have occurred in drinking water systems despite negative bacterial results. Using viral markers may therefore provide more accurate health risk assessment data. In this study, fecal, wastewater, stormwater, surface water (fresh and salt), groundwater, and drinking water samples were analyzed for the presence or concentration of traditional indicators, innovative indicators and viral markers. Samples were obtained in the United States, Italy, and Australia and results compared to those reported for studies conducted in Asia and South America as well. Indicators included total coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, male-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages and microviradae. Viral markers included adenovirus, polyomavirus, and a potential new surrogate, Torque teno virus (TTV). TTV was more frequently found in wastewaters (38-100%) and waters influenced by waste discharges (25%) than in surface waters used as drinking water sources (5%). TTV was also specific to human rather than animal feces. While TTV numbers were strongly correlated to other viral markers in wastewaters, suggesting its utility as a fecal contamination marker, data limitations and TTV presence in treated drinking waters demonstrates that additional research is needed on this potential viral indicator.

The aim of this study was to verify TTSuVs loads in pig faeces from PCV2-positive animals with and without diarrhea from PCVAD-affected and PCV2-unvaccinated herds. A total of 80 faecal samples were collected individually from nursery and grow-finish pigs with (n = 40) or without (n = 40) diarrhea. The samples were tested for PCV2 and TTSuVs by using DNA binding dye SYBR Green quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Torque teno sus virus k2 (TTSuVk2) load in the faeces was significantly higher in the nursery pigs with diarrhea, and these pigs also exhibited significantly higher PCV2 (P < 0.01) faecal matter loads compared to the non-diarrheic animals from the same age group. Torque teno sus virus I (TTSuV1) viral loads were the same regardless of age group and disease condition. There were no correlations between PCV2 and TTSuV1 or TTSuVk2 and TTSuV1 viral loads; however, a weak correlation (r = 0.23, P = 0.03) was found between TTSuVk2 and PCV2 viral loads. In conclusion, ITSuVk2 viral loads were significantly higher in the diarrheic faeces from the nursery pigs. Additionally, the higher loads of PCV2 and TTSuVk2 in the nursery-diarrheic animals revealed that diarrhea might have an important role in the spread of both viruses in herds.

Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular single-stranded DNA virus whose pathological significance remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and titer of TTV DNA in IPF patients with acute respiratory worsening.Methods The serum TTV DNA titer was measured using real-time PCR in nine IPF patients (two treated with steroids and immunosuppressants; seven treated without steroids or immunosuppressants) who developed acute worsening, including five patients with acute exacerbation. The serum TTV DNA titer was also measured in eight stable IPF cases and four IPF cases of lung cancer. In addition, in order to examine time course changes in the TTV DNA titer, the titer was measured more than once, with an interval of four weeks or longer, in eight patients.Results Among the nine IPF patients with acute worsening, the TTV DNA titer was above 1x10(6) copies/mL in two subjects without acute exacerbation who had been continuously treated with steroids and immunosuppressants. Meanwhile, the mean TTV DNA titer was 2.4 +/- 2.6 (x10(4) copies/mL) in the five patients with acute exacerbation and 3.1 +/- 3.4 (x10(4) copies/mL) in the eight patients with stable IPF. Moreover, the TTV DNA titers were increased in all three IPF patients who started treatment with steroids and immunosuppressants.Conclusion Our results suggest that it is unlikely that TTV is directly involved in the onset of acute exacerbation of IPF and that the serum TTV DNA titer potentially reflects the immunosuppressive state of the host due to treatment.

Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in 61.3% of the subjects, most of whom had ARI (90.8%, OR = 11.39), were hospitalized (96.9%, OR = 22.31), had asthma exacerbation (90.9%, OR = 8.67), and/or had pneumonia (80%, OR = 4.0). Human rhinovirus (HRV) A43 predominated. Influenza A H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) subtypes Al and A2, the influenza B virus, human adenovirus B, and human coronavirus OC43 were also detected. All respiratory viruses were detected in the transition month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed respiratory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza A H3N2 virus with TTV, HMPV with TTV, HRV with TTV, and human parainfluenza virus-3 with TTV were found in 4.7, 2.8, 19.8, and 0.9% of the samples, respectively.

Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to evaluate the risk to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example, failure to thrive. There is a paucity of data regarding detection and characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in porcines in Ireland. Recently, a number of small novel porcine DNAviruses have emerged globally, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 & 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses which has been recently detected in humans and animals.Methods: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 specimens were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a subset of specimens (n = 44) were then examined individually. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques.Results: Initial screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three distinct groups in phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and lineage I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some specimens contained >1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm.Conclusion: Investigating the diversity of circulating enteric viruses on Irish porcine farms is important to improve the prophylactic tools available and to facilitate the early detection of changes in circulating viruses.

Environmental Engineering Science		2014	DEC 1 2014	31	12	671-680	671	680							Indicator organisms are used to assess pathogen risk in waters, however, indicators often do not correlate with pathogens. Direct pathogen monitoring (e.g., human adenoviruses) may provide data on actual risk from one pathogen but may not be indicative of overall risk. A potential alternative indicator is Torque teno virus (TTV), which may co-locate with pathogenic enteric viruses but has not been associated with any disease. The objective of this research was to determine the value of TTV as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination and viral pathogen risk in the United States. Occurrence of TTV in animal feces, wastewaters, and drinking waters was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with primers in the highly conserved untranscribed region to detect TTV human genotypes. These data were compared to data on standard indicators and human adenovirus presence. TTV was detected in 4.0% of animal feces, 41.7% of wastewater samples, and 13.9% of drinking water samples. These relatively low positive rates in waters may reflect the relatively low prevalence of serum TTV positivity in the United States. Adenoviruses were detected in a larger percentage (83.3%) of wastewaters (indicative of human fecal contamination) than TTV, and analysis of nonhuman animal feces showed the human adenovirus assay to have a higher degree of specificity. This study adds to the understanding of the global occurrence of TTV. Based on a lack of correlation with fecal indicators and varying prevalence rates in humans, TTV does not appear to be a suitable indicator of fecal contamination.														1092-8758	1557-9018	10.1089/ees.2014.0091																		J	BCI:BCI201500066121	25411972			High Prevalence of Co-Infection with Multiple Torque Teno Sus Virus Species in Italian Pig Herds		Blois, Sylvain; Mallus, Francesca; Liciardi, Manuele; Pilo, Cristian; Camboni, Tania; Macera, Lisa; Maggi, Fabrizio; Manzin, Aldo (aldomanzin@medicina.unica.it)									PLoS One		2014	NOV 20 2014	9	11	Article No.: e113720	e113720								Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a large group of vertebrate-infecting small viruses with circular single-stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family.

The rate of co-infection with two and/or three species was also calculated, and data show that co-infections were significantly more frequent than infections with single species, and that TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a double infection was the prevalent combination (35.4%). Quantitative results obtained using species-specific real time-qPCR evidenced the highest mean levels of viremia in the TTSuV1 subgroup, and the lowest in the TTSuVk2b subgroup. Interestingly, multiple infections with distinct TTSuV species seemed to significantly affect the DNA load and specifically, data highlighted that double infection with TTSuVk2a increased the viral titers of TTSuV1, likewise the co-infection with TTSuVk2b increased the titers of TTSuVk2a.

We investigated the proportion, epidemiological and clinical features of concurrent infections of adenovirus (ADV), norovirus (NV) and TTV in stools of 155 patients with AGE attending Wei-Gong Memorial Hospital, Miaoli City, Taiwan. The presence of the three viruses were determined using PCR-based assays. Some 55% of the patients were infected with at least 1 enteric virus, among whom 18% were co-infected, NV and TTV being the most common (62%). Rate of co-infectious in AGE patients is correlated statistically significantly (p < 0.05) with age, fever and drinking of spring water. Furthermore, AGE children with co-infection have a higher hospitalization rate (69%). To the best of our knowledge, this is-the first report of ADV, NV and TTV triple co-infection in children (2) with AGE. This study also revealed that TTV co-infection promoted the pathogenicity of other infectious agents.

The association of immunosenescence with gender and persistent infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a matter of intensive research. We determined whether replication of another persistent and highly prevalent virus, Torque teno virus (TTV), is related to age, gender, and HCMV IgG serostatus of the host. TTV DNA load in plasma was assessed by real-time PCR in 313 healthy persons: 20-30 years old (young, n=104), 50-60 years old (middle-aged, n=101), or >80 years old (elderly, n=108). TTV DNA loads were further associated with age-groups, gender, and HCMV IgG serostatus. TTV load was significantly higher in the elderly compared to the young group (p<0.001; Tukey's honest significant difference (HSD)), and the higher TTV DNA levels over age were found to be gender-specific (p=0.002; ANOVA), with young women showing the lowest TTV load compared to young men (p=0.009, t test) and compared to the other female age-groups (middle-aged p=0.005; elderly p<0.001; Tukey's HSD). TTV load of HCMV IgG-seropositive persons was significantly higher than that of the HCMV IgG seronegative in the young (p=0.005; t test) and middle-aged (p=0.016; t test) groups. These results indicate that the host's immune control of TTV replication decreases with age and is gender-specific. Persistent HCMV infection is significantly related to higher TTV DNA loads, especially at a younger age. Therefore, the influence of gender and HCMV on immunosenescence earlier in life should be further explored.

The presence and viral load of TTSuV1 were investigated in a wide range of samples from 5 PRRSV positive/negative 4-week-old pigs by real-time TaqMan PCR. TTSuV1 was detected in 65.3% of 1115 PRRSV-positive samples, and 47.2% of 1269 negative samples. Viral DNA was most commonly detected in the immune organs, including spleen, lung, pancreas, and mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, followed by serum, liver, kidney, trachea, anal swabs, nasal swabs and sex glands of PRRSV-positive or negative pigs. TTSuV1 DNA loads in PRRSV-positive pigs increased from 2 to 5 times in almost all the corresponding parts compared with PRRSV-negative pigs. Statistical analysis showed that PRRSV may have a synergistic effect with TTSuV1, and promote the replication and proliferation of TTSuV1. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the pathogenic role of TTSuV is still inconclusive, and the target cell and tissue tropism of this virus are also ambiguous. In the present study, a multi-strained pooled probe-based in situ hybridization was established to detect the nucleic acids of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in the tissue. The strategy of using polymerase chain reaction-derived digoxigenin-labeled multi-strained pooled probe, instead of single-strained probe or oligonucleotide, was to overcome the fact of high sequence diversity among TTSuV strains and simultaneous infection with distinct strains of TTSuV in the same animal. The cell tropism and tissue distribution were evaluated by grading system with tissues from major organs. Lymphoid tissues, including superficial inguinal, mesenteric, and hilar lymph nodes, tonsil, intestinal lamina propria of mucosa and Peyer's patches, and sometimes spleen, generally contained higher levels of positive signals and are considered as the target sites for TTSuV. Morphologically, the distribution of TTSuV-positive signals had a strong correlation with the T lymphocyte zone. T lymphocytes are, thus, speculated as the major target cells for TTSuV.

An expanding body of evidence supports the role of human microbiome in the establishment of CVDs and, this has gained much attention recently. This work was aimed to study the circulating human microbiome in CVD patients and healthy subjects. The levels of circulating cell free DNA (circDNA) was higher in CVD patients (n = 80) than in healthy controls (n = 40). More specifically, the relative levels of circulating bacterial DNA and the ratio of 16S rRNA/beta-globin gene copy numbers were higher in the circulation of CVD patients than healthy individuals. In addition, we found a higher circulating microbial diversity in CVD patients (n = 3) in comparison to healthy individuals (n = 3) by deep shotgun sequencing. At the phylum level, we observed a dominance of Actinobacteria in CVD patients, followed by Proteobacteria, in contrast to that in healthy controls, where Proteobacteria was predominantly enriched, followed by Actinobacteria. The circulating virome in CVD patients was enriched with bacteriophages with a preponderance of Propionibacterium phages, followed by Pseudomonas phages and Rhizobium phages in contrast to that in healthy individuals, where a relatively greater abundance of eukaryotic viruses dominated by Lymphocystis virus (LCV) and Torque Teno viruses (TTV) was observed. Thus, the release of bacterial and viral DNA elements in the circulation could play a major role leading to elevated circDNA levels in CVD patients. The increased circDNA levels could be either the cause or consequence of CVD incidence, which needs to be explored further.

Many viruses are known to persist in the inanimate environment and may pose a risk to patients and health care workers. We investigate the frequency of environmental contamination with common health care-associated viruses and explore the use of torque-teno virus as a marker of environmental contamination.Methods: Environmental screening for a variety of clinically relevant viruses was carried out over 3 months in a UK pediatric hospital using air sampling and surface swabbing. Swabs were tested for the presence of virus nucleic acid by quantitative polymerase chain reactions.Results: Viral nucleic acid was found on surfaces and in the air throughout the screening period, with adenovirus DNA being the most frequent. Door handles were frequently contaminated. Torque-teno virus was also found at numerous sites.Conclusion: Evidence of environmental contamination with viral pathogens is present in health care environments and may be indicative of an infectious virus being present. Screening for viruses should be included in infection control strategies. Torque-teno virus may provide a better marker of contamination and reduce time and cost of screening for individual viruses.

Human infections with the prototype anellovirus, torque teno virus (TTV), are ubiquitous and related viruses have been described in a number of other mammalian hosts. Despite over 15 years of investigation, there is still little known about the pathogenesis and possible disease associations of anellovirus infections, arising in part due to the lack of a robust cell culture system for viral replication or tractable small-animal model. We report the identification of diverse anelloviruses in several species of wild rodents. The viruses are highly prevalent in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and field voles (Microtus agrestis), detectable at a low frequency in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), but absent from house mice (Mus musculus). The viruses identified have a genomic organization consistent with other anelloviruses, but form two clear phylogenetic groups that are as distinct from each other as from defined genera.

The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus-4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact co-infected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.														0022-1317	1465-2099	10.1099/vir.0.063743-0																		J	BCI:BCI201400592271	24818773			Viral contamination of aerosol and surfaces through toilet use in health care and other settings		Verani, Marco; Bigazzi, Roberto; Carducci, Annalaura (annalaura.carducci@unipi.it)									American Journal of Infection Control		2014	JUL 2014	42	7	758-762	758	762							Background: The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations.Methods: To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used.Results: On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination.Conclusions: The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread.

Serum samples were obtained over time from 20 pigs. Twelve of 20 were exposed to TTSuV2 on day 0,20/20 were vaccinated with a PRRSV-2 vaccine on day 35, and 20/20 were exposed to PRRSV-2 on day 63. Anti-TTSuV antibodies were detected in 30% of the pigs on day 0, and 90% by day 35. All PRRSV-2 vaccinated pigs had detectable anti-PRRSV-2 IgG 21 days after vaccination. Field samples from 17 farms were also tested. The seroprevalence of both PRRSV and TTSuV increased with age. Comparison of the PRRSV-2 FMIA to an ELISA revealed good correlation in young pigs but a high rate of false positives in older pigs. Cross-reaction between PRRSV types was a problem.

Since its discovery in 1997, several studies have questioned the role of this virus in causing disease. However, it still remains an enigma. Although methods are available for detection of TTV infection, there is still a need for simple, rapid and reliable method for screening of this virus in human population. Present investigation describes the cloning and expression of N22 region of TTV-genome and the use of expressed peptide in development of immunoassay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in serum. Since TTV genotype-1 is more common in India, the serum positive for genotype-1 was used as source of N22 for expression purpose.Methods: Full length N22 region of ORF1 from TTV genotype-1 was amplified and cloned in pGEM (R)-T Easy vector. After cloning, the amplicon was transformed and expressed as a fusion protein containing hexa-histidine tag in pET-28a(+) vector using BL21 E. coli cells as host. Expression was conducted both in LB medium as well as ZYP-5052 auto-induction medium. The expressed peptide was purified using metal-chelate affinity chromatography and used as antigen in developing a blot immunoassay.Results: Analysis of translated product by SDS-PAGE and western blotting demonstrated the presence of 25 kDa polypeptide produced after expression. Solubility studies showed the polypeptide to be associated with insoluble fraction. The use of this peptide as antigen in blot assay produced prominent spot on membrane treated with sera from TTV-infected patients. Analysis of sera from 75 patients with liver and renal diseases demonstrated a successful implication of N22 polypeptide based immunoassay in screening sera for anti-TTV antibodies. Comparison of the immunoassay developed using expressed N22 peptide with established PCR method for TTV-DNA detection showed good coherence between TTV DNA and presence of anti TTV antibodies in the sera analysed.Conclusions: This concludes that TTV N22 region may be expressed and safely used as antigen for blot assay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in sera.

In market ready swine, the reported prevalence ranges between 11% and 100%. Through a national retail sampling plan from the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) program, 283 and 599 liver and pork chop samples, respectively, were collected over a 12-month period from commercial establishments in 5 selected geographical regions of Canada to assess the presence of Torque teno sus viruses (ITSuVs) in these products.TTSuVs were detected in 97.9% of pork chops with viral loads ranging between I x 10(4) and 9.9 x 10(5) genomic copies (gc)/g and 98.6% of liver samples with viral loads ranging from 1 x 10(5) to 9.9 x 10(6) gc/g.A selection of 20 positive samples (10 pork chop and 10 liver) from the 5 geographical regions were further tested for the production, of a 305 bp fragment for TTSuV1 and a 253 bp fragment for TTSuV2 in the non-coding region. TTSuV1 was present in all 10 liver and 10 pork chops samples while TTSuV2 was detected in 10 liver and 9 pork chop samples. Two different 1TSuV1 sequences were simultaneously detected from 5 of 20 samples and 2 different 1TSuV2 sequences were detected from 6 of 19 samples. The omnipresence of TTSuVs in commercial pork samples may allow its use as a viral indicator to monitor the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting process in slaughtering, cutting, slicing and packaging facilities.

Using high-throughput unbiased sequencing to screen for viruses in the serum of a patient with persistent high fever who died of suspected viral infection and prolonged weakness, we identified the complete genome sequence of a TTV (isolate Hebei-1). The genome of TTV-Hebei-1 is 3649 bp in length, encoding four putative open reading frames, and it has a G+C content of 49%. Genomic comparison and a BLASTN search revealed that the assembled genome of TTV-Hebei-1 represented a novel isolate, with a genome sequence that was highly heterologous to the sequences of other reported TTV strains. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the complete genome sequence showed that TTV-Hebei-1 and an uncharacterized Taiwanese strain, TW53A37, constitute a new TTV genotype. The patient was strongly suspected of carrying a viral infection and died eventually without any other possible causes being apparent. No virus other than the novel TTV was identified in his serum sample. Although a direct causal link between the novel TTV genotype infection and the patient's disease could not be confirmed, the findings suggest that surveillance of this novel TTV genotype is necessary and that its role in disease deserves to be explored.

Currently, 40% to 85% of pericarditis cases have no identified etiology. Most of these cases are thought to be caused by an infection of undetected, unsuspected or unknown viruses. In this work, we used a culture-and sequence-independent approach to investigate the viral DNA communities present in human pericardial fluids. Seven viral metagenomes were generated from the pericardial fluid of patients affected by pericarditis of unknown etiology and one metagenome was generated from the pericardial fluid of a sudden infant death case. As a positive control we generated one metagenome from the pericardial fluid of a patient affected by pericarditis caused by herpesvirus type 3. Furthermore, we used as negative controls a total of 6 pericardial fluids from 6 different individuals affected by pericarditis of non-infectious origin: 5 of them were sequenced as a unique pool and the remaining one was sequenced separately. The results showed a significant presence of torque teno viruses especially in one patient, while herpesviruses and papillomaviruses were present in the positive control. Co-infections by different genotypes of the same viral type (torque teno viruses) or different viruses (herpesviruses and papillomaviruses) were observed. Sequences related to bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus, Enterobacteria, Streptococcus, Burkholderia and Pseudomonas were also detected in three patients. This study detected torque teno viruses and papillomaviruses, for the first time, in human pericardial fluids.

The ocular surface microbiome has been incompletely characterized. We applied Biome Representational in Silico Karyotyping (BRiSK), a representational deep DNA sequencing technique, to the upper and lower lid conjunctiva of both eyes of 9 healthy subjects.Methods: Conjunctiva were swabbed using forensic DNA recovery swabs. DNA was purified and subjected to PCR for human actin gene, 16S rDNA PCR, and analyzed by BRiSK. 33 bp DNA sequence tags from BRiSK were compared to a comprehensive database for species identification. Suspected organisms' presence was confirmed by independent PCR.Results: High quality DNA was obtained from 27 of 36 samples as judged by actin PCR and BRiSK karyoptype. Significant 16S amplification was observed in only 5 samples, from 3 individuals. BRiSK revealed multiple sequence tags corresponding to the small anellovirus Torque Teno virus (TTV) in 5 samples from 3 individuals. Only one sample was positive for both 16S and TTV. PCR for TTV was strongly positive in 10 samples from five individuals, including all 5 samples positive by BRiSK. TTV was bilateral in four individuals, and found predominantly in samples from the upper lid.Conclusions: The ocular surface microbiome of the healthy conjunctiva contains limited amounts of bacteria. Torque teno virus DNA is found frequently and abundantly on the ocular surface of healthy subjects.

Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous infectious agent. Transplant recipients are at risk of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and could be vulnerable to TTV-associated adverse effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of immunosuppression and HEV infection on TTV replication and liver injury in pediatric patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods. Pediatric recipients of liver transplants were classified into the following 2 groups: (1) those with normal serum aminotransferases levels and (2) those with persistently increased serum aminotransferases levels and histological features of chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology. The TTV load was assessed in 342 serum samples by use of TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction, along with TTV genogroups and coinfection with HEV.Results. TTV DNA was detected in 96% of tested serum samples. Viral load was significantly lower in patients with features of chronic hepatitis, of whom 78% had liver fibrosis scores of >= 2. Viral load decreased during posttransplantation follow-up. Viral load and genogroups were influenced by immunosuppression. Lower viral load was observed in patients coinfected with HEV.Conclusions. TTV infection is widespread, and its replication is closely related to immune status and viral coinfection. High TTV viremia is not associated with hepatitis after OLT, but, conversely, liver inflammatory activity impairs TTV replication.														0022-1899	1537-6613	10.1093/infdis/jit423																		J	BCI:BCI201500584028				High Levels of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) in Lung and Upper Respiratory Tract of Lung Transplant Recipients		Young, J.

Although TTV viremia is extremely common in the general population worldwide, there is no direct causal evidence linking TTV infection to specific clinical manifestations. Our hypothesis was that TTV might play a role in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by inducing inflammatory mechanisms previously identified. The study was conducted on 57 COPD patients and 39 healthy control groups. COPD patient groups included: the patients (n:20) with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation, the patients (n: 19) who received only medical treatment, and the invited patients (n: 18) for outpatient control. Serum samples were collected from patients and voluntary blood donors. TTV DNA quantification was carried out with a real time PCR by the hybridization probe system and viral load was interpreted through the crossing point value. TTV DNA was detected in the majority of both patients and healthy control groups. The prevalence was 94.4% (17/18) in patients for outpatient control, 94.7% (18/19) in patients who received only medical treatment, 100% (20/20) in patients with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation and 84.6% (33/39) in healthy controls. This difference was not statistically significant. However, CP values was statistically different in all the patient groups from the control group. TTV DNA prevalence was higher in patients than healthy individuals. More interesting thing, viral load was highest in the patients with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation. As a result, TTV may be associated with COPD and the severity of it.

Eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the Cap protein were generated and biologically characterized. The immunoreactivity of the Cap protein expressed in transfected 293T cells for these mAbs was determined with an immunoperoxidase rnonolayer assay. The antigen epitopes of the Cap protein were mapped using these mAbs and truncated Cap proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Fine epitope mapping was then performed with a panel of synthesized polypeptides. All the mAbs reacted with the Cap protein C fragment expressed in E. coli. One antigenic epitope of the Cap protein, which reacted with seven mAbs, had the polypeptide sequence (536)HPICYAGQGGGYTT(548), whereas another epitope recognized by the 1E9 mAb had the polypeptide sequence (549)EIGHQGITAASLR(561).

Here, we determined the coding sequences of the TTSuV2 NSPs ORF2, ORF2/2, and ORF2/2/3 by overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent expression in bacterial and mammalian cells. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2E5 and 6F8, from mice immunized with mixed Escherichia coli expressing His-tagged ORF2 and ORF2/2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis revealed that, 2E5 mAbs bound to the consensus sequences of ORF2, ORF2/2, and ORF2/2/3, while 6F8 recognized the common sequences of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that ORF2 was localized in the cytoplasm, ORF2/2, in the nucleus but not the nucleolus, and ORF2/2/3, in the pen-nuclear region. To identify the expression profiles of TTSuV NSPs, a circular TTSuV2_ZJ (GenBank: KF660540) genomic DNA clone was constructed and transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells. Splicing mRNAs and the expression and localization of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3 were identified by RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and IFA, respectively. However, ORF2 was not detected either at the RNA or protein level. Our study is the first to provide experimental evidence of the existence of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3 at the protein level. Moreover, the mAbs have potential applications in future research on TTSuV2 viral protein function and diagnosis of related diseases. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Currently, these viruses are considered non-pathogenic although they are suggested to be co-factors in several diseases. Recently single-stranded circular DNA viruses have been found in human faeces. Considering the consumption of pork meat products and the ubiquitous nature of swine TTV (Torque tenosus virus, TTSuV), the human population is frequently exposed to these viruses. To determine if TTSuVs could be delivered through food, human faecal samples were analysed for their presence. Indeed, the results of this study show that up to 25% of faecal samples were positive for known TTSuVs by PCR and sequencing. Additionally, all commercially available pork products purchased in Spanish supermarkets contained DNA of TTSuV. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(Chris_sullivan@mail.utexas.edu)									PLoS Pathogens		2013	DEC 2013	9	12	Article No.: e1003818	e1003818								Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a group of viruses with small, circular DNA genomes. Members of this family are thought to ubiquitously infect humans, although causal disease associations are currently lacking. At present, there is no understanding of how infection with this diverse group of viruses is so prevalent. Using a combined computational and synthetic approach, we predict and identify miRNA-coding regions in diverse human TTVs and provide evidence for TTV miRNA production in vivo. The TTV miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer, and are active in RISC. A TTV mutant defective for miRNA production replicates as well as wild type virus genome; demonstrating that the TTV miRNA is dispensable for genome replication in a cell culture model. We demonstrate that a recombinant TTV genome is capable of expressing an exogenous miRNA, indicating the potential utility of TTV as a small RNA vector. Gene expression profiling of host cells identifies N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) as a target of a TTV miRNA. NMI transcripts are directly regulated through a binding site in the 3'UTR. SiRNA knockdown of NMI contributes to a decreased response to interferon signaling. Consistent with this, we show that a TTV miRNA mediates a decreased response to IFN and increased cellular proliferation in the presence of IFN. Thus, we add Annelloviridae to the growing list of virus families that encode miRNAs, and suggest that miRNA-mediated immune evasion can contribute to the pervasiveness associated with some of these viruses.				, Rodney/0000-0002-5318-3934										1553-7366	1553-7374	10.1371/journal.ppat.1003818																		J	BCI:BCI201400018900				A Novel Subgenotype of Torque teno Virus 1 (TTSuV1) in Slaughter Pigs in China		Huang, Jinhai (jinhaih@tju.edu.cn) ; Li, Yi; Liu, Mengmeng; Xia, Yihe; Li, Zhirong									Food and Environmental Virology		2013	DEC 2013	5	4	226-230	226	230							TTsuV1 can cause persistent infection and unidentified clinical signs in pigs. In this study, a survey of TTsuV1 prevalence was conducted in slaughter pigs from Henan, Liaoning, and Shandong provinces in China. A total of 180 swine lymphoid tissues were assayed by PCR with primers targeting the conserved 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR). The results showed that a 17.8 % positive rate, and different genotypes were detected. TTSuV1 presented higher viral load and prevalence in inguinal lymph node than in submandibular lymph node samples. All TTsuV1 isolates have 84-100 % nucleotide sequence homology in the 5'-UTR region and can be grouped into three subgenotypes (TTsuV1(a-1), TTsuV1(a-2), and TTsuV1(b)).

The relationship that TTV establishes with the central nervous system (CNS) of infected hosts is not clear but it is suspected that TTV infection of the CNS lead to increased local expression of inflammatory mediators that may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The prevalence and load of TTV in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 207 MS patients and 93 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by qPCR designed on the untranslated region were analyzed. TTV DNA was not detected in CSF, TTV prevalence in serum was similar in MS patients (76.8%) compared to healthy controls (76.3%). Sub analyses performed in MS patients stratified on the basis of clinical phenotypes indicated that TTV viremia was significantly lower in individuals with relapsing remitting compared to chronic progressive disease. Notably, viremia was increased in primary progressive, compared to secondary progressive MS patients, and in relapsing remitting MS patients during quiescent compared to relapsing phases of disease. Since TTV interacts with toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines, TLR9 expression were examined, showing that it was augmented on monocytes of chronic progressive MS patients, in whom higher TTV viremia was present, but this did not correlate with a distinct pattern of cytokine production. Overall these findings suggest that, although TTV infects the same proportion of MS patients and healthy controls, the levels of replication of the virus differ among patients, being correlated with the clinical phenotype of disease.

In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1. However the similarity was low for each virus and its host. These conclusions provide important insight into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV2, as well as better understangding of the molecular evolution of TTSuV2 genomes.														1932-6203	1932-6203	10.1371/journal.pone.0081469																		J	BCI:BCI201400015731	23917836			Virus Occupational Exposure in Solid Waste Processing Facilities		Carducci, Annalaura (acarducci@biologia.unipi.it) ; Federigi, Ileana; Verani, Marco									Annals of Occupational Hygiene		2013	NOV 2013	57	9	1115-1127	1115	1127							It is well known that workers involved in the management of solid waste are at risk of exposure to bioaerosol, which is generally studied in relation to bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins. However, to date, there have been no reports on the incidence of work-related infectious diseases. To determine if occupational exposure to viruses occurs upon exposure to waste-related activities, monitoring was carried out in a landfill, a waste recycling plant, an incineration plant, and a waste collection vehicles. Air and surfaces were sampled and analyzed for torque teno virus (TTV), human adenovirus (HAdV), norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. Positivity was confirmed by sequencing and quantification with real-time PCR; infectivity was also tested for culturable viruses. Samples were analyzed in parallel for mean total bacterial and fungi counts in both the summer and winter. In total, 30% (12/40) of air and 13.5% (5/37) of surface samples collected in plants were positive for HAdV and TTV. Among the eight HAdV-positive samples, six (75%), revealed in landfill and recycling plant air and in incinerator and waste vehicles surfaces, were able to replicate in cell culture and were subsequently confirmed as infective. The frequency of detection of virus-positive samples was similar in both seasons, but with evident differences in the type of virus detected: TTV and HAdV were more frequently detected in the summer and winter, respectively. The area of highest viral contamination was the paper selection landfill. Fungi and bacterial contamination did not correlate with viral presence or concentration. In conclusion, we evidence that working with solid and liquid waste can lead to infectious viruses, included in Group 2 of the European Directive 90/679/CEE pathogens list; thus, further investigation on the sources and routes of contamination is needed in order to assess the occupational risk.

The viruses reveal a remarkable heterogeneity and it is possible that some genotypes are more pathogenic than others. The identification of all genotypes is essential to confirm previous pathogenicity data, and an unbiased search for novel viruses is needed to identify TTVs that might be related to disease.Method: The virus discovery technique VIDISCA-454 was used to screen serum of 55 HIV-1 positive injecting drug users, from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies, in search for novel blood-blood transmittable viruses which are undetectable via normal diagnostics or panvirus-primer PCRs.Results: A novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was identified in two patients and the sequence of the full genomes were determined. The virus is significantly different from the known TTMVs (< 40% amino acid identity in ORF1), yet it contains conserved characteristics that are also present in other TTMVs. The virus is chronically present in both patients, and these patients both suffered from a pneumococcal pneumonia during follow up and had extremely low B-cells counts.Conclusion: We describe a novel TTMV which we tentatively named TTMV-13.

Two distinct species of TTSuVs, 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) have been reported so far in domestic pigs and wild boars. Although TTSuVs have not been clearly linked to any specific disease of pigs, a relation between TTSuV infections and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) has been suggested. To examine further this possibility, the present study was conducted in search for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomes in tissues of PMWS and non-PMWS-affected animals. PMWS diagnosis was established by clinical signs, characteristic macroscopic and histopathologic lesions and the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 DNA. Samples of five different tissues (lungs, kidneys, livers, spleens, and lymph nodes) from PMWS-affected and non-PMWS-affected pigs were examined with two specific PCR assays developed to amplify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genome segments. TTSuV1 DNA was detected in tissues of non-diseased animals to significantly higher levels than in tissues of PMWS-affected pigs (p a parts per thousand currency sign 0.001). Regarding TTSuV2, viral genomes were detected in nearly all samples from both PMWS-affected (94.7 %) and non-affected pigs (100 %), with no significant differences in the frequencies of detection of TTSuV2 genomes in both groups. No significant differences were detected on the distribution of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in the different tissues examined (p = 0.970).

However, the genetic diversity, phylogeny and evolutionary processes responsible for the emergence and spread of TTSuVs in wild boars remain poorly understood. Here we implemented phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses to address key questions on the genetic diversity, evolutionary scenario and spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging TTSuVs in wild boars of the Western region (Transylvania) of Romania. High levels of genetic diversity of wild boar origin TTSuV1-2 have been found as well as a new TTSuV1 genotype and several new subtypes. Phylogenies suggest that several wild boar viral strains in both TTSuV species are likely to have emerged from a well-defined ancestor approximately 40 (TTSuV1) and 18 (TTSuV2) years ago and showed independent evolutionary trajectories. Bayesian phylogeography showed an intense flow of viral strains throughout the Transylvanian counties possibly related to wild host migrations, facilitating the rapid spread of TTSuVs. The intra-genotype and inter- and intrahost level recombination, intense spatio-temporal viral flow and the positively selected sites found in the ORF2 genes should be considered important driving forces shaping TTSuVs evolution. The first reported rates of nucleotide substitution for porcine anelloviruses, estimated to be 5.29-5.51 x 10(-4) subs site(-1) year(-1), are in line with those measured previously for mammalian ssDNA viruses and RNA viruses. These high evolutionary rates of TTSuVs, independent of recombination, are reflections of adaptive evolution, an important factor in the emergence of novel viral variants which may explain their ability to emerge in Suidae hosts.

Plasma and fecal material were collected at 2, 8 and 18 weeks of age and between 22 and 29 weeks of age, while organs and tissues were collected at slaughter.Both viruses were found to disseminate very quickly within the herd. At 8 weeks, TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 were observed at rates of 88% and 58%, respectively, and peak excretion occurred at 18 weeks. Furthermore, TTSuV DNA was detected in the plasma of between 96% and 100% of the animals, and viremia was maintained at a viral load between 5 x 10(4) and 5 x 10(6) copies/mL until slaughter.

The present study investigated the genetic and biological specifications of new isolates of torque teno mini virus (TTMV) detected in pleural effusion samples from children hospitalised for severe pneumonia with PPE.A pathogen discovery protocol was applied in undiagnosed pleural effusion samples and led to the identification of three new isolates of TTMV (TTMV-LY). Isolated TTMV-LY genomes were transfected into A549 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells and viral replication was assessed by quantitative real-time PCR and full-length genome amplification. A549 cells were further infected with released TTMV-LY virions and the induced-innate immune response was measured by multiplex immunoassays.Genetic analyses of the three TTMV-LY genomes revealed a classic genomic organisation but a weak identity (<64%) with known sequences. We demonstrated the in vitro replication of TTMV-LY in alveolar epithelial cells and the effective release of infectious viral particles. We also showed a selective production of inflammatory mediators in response to TTMV infection.This study reports the description of replicative TTMV-LY isolated from parapneumonic effusions of children hospitalised with PPE, suggesting a potential role of the virus in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

Iss. SI	95-101	95	101							In our world, which is faced today with exceptional environmental changes and dramatically intensifying globalisation, we are encountering challenges due to many new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of novel, so far "unknown" infectious diseases. Although a broad arsenal of diagnostic methods is at our disposal, the majority of the conventional diagnostic tests is highly virus-specific or is targeted entirely towards a limited group of infectious agents. This specificity complicates or even hinders the detection of new or unexpected pathogens, such as new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or novel viral variants. The recently developed approaches of viral metagenomics provide an effective novel way to screen samples and detect viruses without previous knowledge of the infectious agent, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control, in line with the "One World, One Health" principles (www.oneworldonehealth.org). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently identified a broad variety of new viruses, such as novel bocaviruses, Torque Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and kobuviruses in porcine disease syndromes, new virus variants in honeybee populations, as well as a range of other infectious agents in further host species.

(alfieri@uel.br)									Pesquisa Veterinaria Brasileira		2013	JUL 2013	33	7	840-846	840	846							Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infection is present in pig herds worldwide. It has been demonstrated that TTSuV might increase the severity of other important viral diseases with economic and public health impacts. At present, there is no information on the age distribution of pigs infected with TTSuV in Brazilian herds. This study evaluated the frequency of TTSuV infection in pigs at different stages of production. Fecal samples (n=190) from pigs at 1 to 24 weeks of age and from breeders at 6 farrow-to-weaning (up to 8 weeks of age) and 9 grower-to-finish (9 weeks of age onwards) farms in the western region of Parana state, Brazil, were evaluated by PCR. Fragments of the 5' UTRs of TTSuV1 and/or TTSuVk2 DNAs were identified in 126 (66.3%) of the fecal samples. Significant differences were found with the percentages of positive samples for TTSuV1, TTSuVk2, and mixed infections by both genera between and within the different pig production stages. Fecal samples from the grower-to-finish farms had TTSuV detection rates (90.1%; 64/71) that were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those from the farrow-to-weaning farms (52.1%; 62/119). TTSuV detection was significantly (p<0.05) more frequent in finisher pigs than in the animals from the other stages. The UTR nucleotide sequences in this study presented higher similarities to strains from Norway (96%, TTSuV1), and Argentina and China (97.1%, TTSuVk2). These results suggest that TTSuV infection has spread to pigs of all production stages and that the viral infection rate increases with the age of the animals. In the western region of Parana state, Brazil, TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2-induced infections were more frequently observed in suckling piglets and finisher pigs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis pointed out the possibility of different strains of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2 circulating in pig herds of Brazil.

To date, members of two distinct genera, Iotatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus 1a and torque teno sus virus 1b (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), and Kappatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus k2a and torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b), have been identified in domestic pigs and wild boars. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of these viruses based on 5' non-coding genes in Chinese swine herds experiencing clinical symptoms. One hundred eighty-five clinical samples from 11 different regions, collected during 2008-2009, were analyzed using a PCR method, and the results revealed a high TTSuV-positive rate of 78.9 % (146/185) in pigs. Moreover, we detected co-infection with multiple TTSuV strains in the same pig. Nucleotide sequencing results revealed greater genetic diversity within the genus Kappatorquevirus than within the genus Iotatorquevirus. In addition, TTSuVk2b, a novel virus discovered in New Zealand in 2012, was also identified in this study. In summary, the present work helps us obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTSuVs.

Torque Teno virus (TTV) seems to be able to interfere with production of some proinflammatory cytokines associated with obesity and related phenotypes. The aim of this study was to test the potential association between obesity, TTV infection and the IL6 G-174C (rs1800795), ACE I/D (rs4646994), AT1R A1166C (rs5186) polymorphisms. The polymorphisms and the presence of TTV were detected in blood samples from 150 obese and 150 normal-weight, healthy subjects using PCR based methods. IL6-174 CC genotype was more frequent in all obese patients (P=0.02) and in patients without TTV infections (P=0.03) than in controls. Obese women had more frequent TTV infections compared with normal-weight women (P=0.046). Obese subjects, regardless of gender (women P=0.03, men P=0.04), and healthy normal-weight men (P < 0.01) carriers of AT1R C allele had higher triglycerides levels compared with non-carriers. The frequency of TTV in the control group (70.67%) was similar to data reported in other populations. The present study indicated that IL6-174 CC genotype and TTV infections in women could be associated with the common form of obesity.

We hereby describe the validation of a SYBR Green-based TTV quantification method for plasma samples.Methods: Plasmids with TTV specific inserts were used for preparing standards and absolute quantification of TTV was performed using SYBR Green methodology. The method was assessed for its accuracy and precision (intra and inter-day) on four non-consecutive days. TTV was also quantified from plasma samples of 20 healthy volunteers and from 30 hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.Results: The assay was specific and showed satisfactory efficiency (82.2%, R-2=0.99) with the limit of quantification defined as 100 copies per reaction. The assay had good precision (inter and intra-day coefficient of variation in cycle threshold (C-T) < 4%) and accuracy (100 +/- 10%) in the range of 100 to 1010 copies/reaction. We found TTV loads ranging from 2.5 - 4.07 log copies/mL of plasma with C-T (mean +/- SD) of 33.8 +/- 1.77 in healthy individuals and 2.06 - 8.49 log copies/mL of plasma with C-T (mean +/- SD) of 24.3 +/- 1.04 in HSCT recipients.Conclusion: SYBR Green-based q-PCR assay combines simplicity with satisfactory sensitivity and may be suitable for monitoring the immune status of transplant recipients, where TTV loads over time may serve as a marker for immune reconstitution in human plasma samples.

But till now, the prevalence of TTSuVs with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in pig herds of China is not very clear; and the genetic variation among different TTSuVs isolate is very large and need to divide the subgroups. In this study, the co-infection with TTSuVs and porcine circovrius (PCV) in the pig population of China was investigated and the subgroups of all TTSuVs genomes in Genbank were divided.Results: Results showed that the rate of co-infection with TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 reached 75% in PCV2-positive samples. Also Two TTSuV1 and four TTSuV2 isolates genome sequences were obtained, and the similarity of all TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomic sequences in GenBank were compared. Phylogenetic trees indicated that both the TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 sequences could be divided into four genotypes. Interestingly, the sub-genotypes TTSuV1d, TTSuV2c and TTSuV2d exist only in the pig population of China.Conclusions: This study demonstrates that co-infection with TTSuVs and PCVs is very common in the pig population of China, in which the viruses maybe contribute to clinical diseases cooperatively. In addition, three new subgroups of TTSuVs emerged in China for the first time and a high level of variation among different isolates of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was indicated by their genetic diversity.														1743-422X		10.1186/1743-422X-10-189																		J	BCI:BCI201300643353	23407420			Preliminary epitope mapping of Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 putative capsid protein and serological detection of infection in pigs		Jarosova, Veronika; Celer, Vladimir (celerv@vfu.cz)									Journal of General Virology		2013	JUN 2013	94	Part 6	1351-1356	1351	1356							The aim of this work is to identify antigenic regions within the ORF1 protein of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno virus sus 2 (TTSuV2) that could be used as antigens to detect virus-specific antibodies following infection in pigs. Protein sequences of TTSuV ORF1 genes were analysed to predict linear antigenic epitopes. Synthesized peptides were analysed for serological reactivity with swine sera. Such an antigenic region was identified at the C terminus of the ORF1 protein of both viruses and showed serological reactivity with 78% (TTSuV1) and 88% (TTSuV2) of swine sera. An ELISA with an immunodominant peptide as antigen was used to examine the sera of piglets, aged 4-20 weeks, and adults. Results indicated that TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-specific antibodies were detectable at 4 weeks. Antibody titres increased from week 10 and peaked at week 20. A relatively high antibody titre persisted to adulthood.

A total of three tissue samples (3/20, 15 %) from post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected pigs and 30 blood samples (30/40, 75 %) from healthy pigs were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and/or 2 (TTSuV2). Two TTSuV strains (TTV1Hn54 and TTV2Hn93) comprising 2,794 and 2,875 nucleotides, respectively, each had four open reading frames (ORFs) and the untranslated region with TATA box and GC-rich region. Genomic sequence of TTV2Hn93 strain was unique in length compared with other TTSuV2 genomic sequences. Interestingly, three rolling-circle replication (RCR) motif-IIIs (YXXK) which were located at amino acid (aa) position 166-169, 328-331, and 379-382, respectively, were found in the ORF1 of TTV1Hn54. Two RCR motif-IIIs (YXXK) at the aa position 105-108 and 480-483 respectively, were also identified in the ORF1 of TTV2Hn93. Phylogenetic tree based on complete genomes showed that TTV1Hn54 strain was designated into type TTSuV1b and had a slight high sequence identity of 91 % with the Canada strain (JQ120664).

Using Biome Representational in Silico Karyotyping (BRiSK), a type IIB DNA restriction enzyme (BsaX1) was used to create a representational set of 27-mer DNA tags for each sample and sequenced using a massively parallel sequencing platform. Tags that uniquely matched viral DNA were included for further analysis. Quantitative PCR was performed to verify the presence of pathogens.Results: Fifteen of the 21 endophthalmitis samples (71.4%) were positive for the Torque Teno Virus (TTV) including 7 out of 7 (100%) of culture-negative samples. In contrast, 0 out of 7 (0%) of the normal vitreous samples were positive for TTV (p = 0.001 by Fisher Exact). No other viruses were recovered in these samples, and the presence and absence of TTV were verified by PCR. A mean of 369.4 TTV tags were recovered per sample (range of 1 to 3,580 tags). Quantitative PCR showed relative multiplicity of infection compared to human genomic DNA of up to 258, suggesting a productive infection.Conclusions: BRiSK is an effective method for identifying viral presence in culture-positive and culture-negative endophthalmitis. TTV is a small non-enveloped single stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 3.8 kb found frequently in the serum of normal individuals (90%) with no clear pathogenic role. TTV has been shown to modulate the immune system by increasing proinflammatory cytokine production of interferon gamma, IL-6, and IL-12 through Toll-like receptor 9. The finding of TTV in high viral load in infectious endophthalmitis samples leads to a number of possible hypotheses including: inflammation directly related to infection, TTV modulating the immune system to increase susceptibility to bacterial co-infection, a proinflammatory state causing culture negative endophthalmitis, or breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier allowing the virus to replicate in the vitreous.

A molecular study was conducted to detect evidence of a phylogenic relationship between these two porcine TTSuV genogroups from the sera of 244 infected pigs located in 21 subordinate prefectures and/or cities of Sichuan.Results: Both genogroups of TTSuV were detected in pig sera collected from all 21 regions examined. Of the 244 samples, virus from either genogroup was detected in 203 (83.2%), while 44 animals (18.0%) were co-infected with viruses of both genogroups. Moreover, TTSuV2 (186/244, 76.2%) was more prevalent than TTSuV1 (61/244, 25%). There was statistically significant difference between the prevalence of genogroups 1 infection alone (9.4%, 23/244) and 2 alone (64.8%, 158/244), and between the prevalence of genogroups 2 (76.2%, 186/244) and both genogroups co-infection (18.0%, 44/244). The untranslated region of the swine TTSuV genome was found to be an adequate molecular marker of the virus for detection and surveillance. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both genogroups 1 and 2 could be further divided into two subtypes, subtype a and b. TTSuV1 subtype b and the two TTSuV2 subtypes are more prevalent in Sichuan Province.Conclusions: Our study presents detailed geographical evidence of TTSuV infection in China.

A total of 20 pigs (10 healthy and 10 diagnosed as PCV2-SD) were chosen for the study. From each pig, a total of 7 tissues were analyzed, including lung, kidney, liver, ileum, bone marrow, and mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes. TTSuV 1 and 2 were quantified by means of species-specific real time quantitative PCR methods. Both TTSuVs were distributed systemically. Results showed the highest loads for TTSuV2 in tissues from diseased pigs. The highest TTSuV1 DNA load was found in bone marrow, lung, and liver, while it was in bone marrow, mediastinal lymph node and liver for TTSuV2. Bone marrow was the tissue with the highest viral DNA burden for both TTSuV species. Overall, statistically significant differences were observed in viral DNA load, with TTSuV2 showing higher loads than TTSuV1 (p < 0.05). Also, tissues from PCVD-SD affected pigs showed higher TTSuV2 loads than tissues of the healthy group (p < 0.05). It was concluded that both TTSuVs had a wide tissue distribution all over the body, with differential load comparing diseased versus healthy pigs. It is likely that other tissues not included in this study would also be infected by TTSuVs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids.

S.									Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research		2013	APR 2013	77	2	81-88	81	88							The current study tested the benefit of commercially available spray-dried bovine colostrum (The Saskatoon Colostrum Company, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) in raising snatch-farrowed, porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pigs. In experiment 1, 12 SF-pCD pigs received a liquid diet composed mainly of bovine colostrum from birth to day 10; 6 remained on the same liquid diet (COL), and the other 6 were fed a diet composed mainly of milk replacer (RPL) until weaning. In experiment 2, 12 SF-pCD pigs were fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning; after weaning, 6 were fed a starter diet containing 20% (w/w) bovine colostrum powder (STARTER-COL), and the other 6 were fed a starter diet without any bovine colostrum (STARTER-CTRL) until termination (day 42 or day 49). In experiment 1 the COL pigs had significantly fewer fever-days than did the RPL pigs. In experiment 2 diarrhea, typhlocolitis, and pancreatic degeneration developed in 4 of the STARTER-COL pigs after weaning. In both experiments all the pigs fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning survived until termination. All pigs tested free of swine influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Porcine parvovirus. In experiment 2 all the pigs tested free of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), but some in both groups tested positive for Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2. In conclusion, with the use of snatch-farrowing and bovine colostrum, pigs can be raised in the absence of porcine maternal antibodies with 100% survival and freedom from most porcine pathogens of biologic relevance. This model is potentially suitable for animal disease research.														0830-9000	0830-9000																			J	BCI:BCI201300263840	23031343			Exploratory study of Torque teno sus viruses in pulmonary inflammatory lesions in pigs		Aramouni, M.

(joaquim.segales@cresa.uab.es)									Veterinary Microbiology		2013	MAR 23 2013	162	2-4	338-344	338	344							The pathogenic role of Torque teno sus viruses 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), and their capacity to induce lesions are controversial. TTSuVs have been linked to porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs) and described as cause of mild respiratory lesions in gnotobiotic pigs; moreover, an increased TTSuV prevalence has been found in porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) affected pigs. In the present study, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 loads and their prevalence were evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung samples displaying different types of inflammatory lesions. Such measurements were made by means of a real time quantitative PCR technique to detect these viruses. The technique was optimised for its use on FFPE tissues comparing results with frozen lung tissues. Selection criteria included negativity against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) and swine influenza virus (Sly). Results from the present study demonstrated that both TTSuVs were present in lung. However, TTSuV2 had higher viral load and prevalence in all the studied groups when compared to TTSuV1. TTSuV2 mean load was also higher in lungs with viral background (interstitial pneumonia and broncho-interstitial pneumonia) when compared to normal lungs or to those with bacterial background (catarrhal-purulent bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis and fibrinous-necrotizing pleuropneumonia). This result suggests a possible role of TTSuV2 in the pathogenic mechanism of inflammatory lesions of lungs compatible with viral infection. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

(fernandors@feevale.br)									Food and Environmental Virology		2013	MAR 2013	5	1	41-45	41	45							Torque teno virus (TTV) was surveyed in tap water collected in schools from three municipalities located in the south of Brazil. TTV genomes were found in 11.7 % (4/34) of the samples. TTV DNA was detected in 10.5 % (2/19) of the samples collected at the city of Caxias do Sul and in 25 % (2/8) of the samples from Pelotas. Those cities have a low rate of sewage treatment. All samples from Santa Cruz do Sul, which has nearly 92 % of its sewage treated, were negative. These results suggest that the amount of sewage treated may have an effect on the detection rates of TTV DNA in drinking water in a given urban area, showing a mild negative correlation (r = -0.76), when comparing the percentage of sewage treatment to the detection of TTV genomes. The detection rate of TTV was also compared with Escherichia coli, showing a strong correlation (r = 0.97), indicating that TTV may be a suitable marker of fecal contamination.			de Oliveira, Ana Beatriz Almeida/V-3804-2019; Fleck, Juliane Deise/AAX-3826-2020; ROEHE, PAULO MICHEL/K-1208-2012; Spilki, Fernando/E-3736-2010	de Oliveira, Ana Beatriz Almeida/0000-0003-3509-2534; Fleck, Juliane Deise/0000-0002-3523-3192; ROEHE, PAULO MICHEL/0000-0002-2370-7661; Spilki, Fernando/0000-0001-5804-7045										1867-0334	1867-0342	10.1007/s12560-012-9096-7																		J	BCI:BCI201300288883	23274109			Increased viral load and prevalence of Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) in pigs experimentally infected with classical swine fever virus (CSFV)		Aramouni, M.; Kekarainen, T.; Ganges, L.; Tarradas, J.; Segales, J. (joaquim.segales@cresa.uab.cat)									Virus Research		2013	MAR 2013	172	1-2	81-84	81	84							Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are considered non-pathogenic viruses, although lately they have been linked to porcine circovirus diseases, mainly with post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). These associations point out a possible pathogenic role of TTSuVs or, alternatively, that TTSuV replication is up-regulated under disease conditions. In order to further explore the association of TTSuVs with disease occurrence, TTSuVs prevalence and viral load were assessed before and after an experimental infection with a highly pathogenic classical swine fever (CSF) virus (CSFV) isolate. Serum samples from 56 animals were analyzed by means of a real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 before and after (between 6 and 13 days post-inoculation) the CSFV challenge. Based on the post-infection clinical evolution and immune response against CSFV, the animals were divided into two groups: group I, with protecting immunity against CSFV and no clinical signs at the day of necropsy, and group II, with no detectable immune response against CSFV and moderate to severe clinical signs. TTSuVs qPCR results indicated that TTSuV2 and not TTSuV1 load in serum increased significantly after challenge with CSFV in the group of pigs with clinical signs, specifically in those with a moderate course of the disease. Therefore, this study emphasizes the different behaviour of both TTSuVs, as already found in the PMWS background, and further supports the association of TTSuV2 with disease occurrence.

However, many unknown viruses are barely detected by means of conventional virus isolation and PCR assay. [Objective] To develop a technology platform for detecting unknown viruses. [Methods] We established the technology based on viral metagenomics in combination with novel molecular diagnostics. The technology is consisted of removal of host nucleic acid, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. [Results] The technology was applied to detect classical swine fever virus (CSFV)-infected cells and a tissue sample of a pig infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). We amplified 13. 7% sequences of CSFV genome and 47. 2% those of PCV2 genome, respectively. Moreover, we amplified 16. 4% sequences of the simian parainfluenza virus type 5 genome from an unknown virus cell culture using the developed method. In addition, using the developed method combined with the high-throughput sequencing, we detected 1. 1% virus sequences, including CSFV, PCV2, torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and human adenovirus type 6 (Ad6) from 7 clinical swine samples of unknown causative agents. [Conclusion] The developed metagenomics-based method showed good sensitivity for detection of both DNA and RNA viruses from diverse swine samples, and has potential for universal detection of known and unknown viruses. It might facilitate the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases.														0001-6209																				J	BCI:BCI201300282627	23114629			Antigenic diversity and seroprevalences of Torque teno viruses in children and adults by ORF2-based immunoassays		Chen, Tingting; Vaisanen, Elina; Mattila, Petri S.; Hedman, Klaus; Soderlund-Venermo, Maria (maria.soderlund-venermo@helsinki.fi)									Journal of General Virology		2013	FEB 2013	94	Part 2	409-417	409	417							Torque teno viruses (TTVs) circulate widely among humans, causing persistent viraemia in healthy individuals. Numerous TTV isolates with high genetic variability have been identified and segregated into 29 species of five major phylogenetic groups. To date, the diversity of TTV sequences, challenges in protein expression and the subsequent lack of serological assays have hampered TTV seroprevalence studies. Moreover, the antigenic relationships of different TTVs and their specific seroprevalences in humans remain unknown. For five TTV strains belonging to different species of four genogroups - we developed, using recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused TTV ORF2 proteins, glutathione GST capture enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) detecting antibodies towards conformational epitopes. We then analysed serum samples from 178 healthy adults and 108 children; IgG reactivities were observed either towards a single strain or towards multiple strains, which pointed to antigenic distinction of TTV species. The overall seroprevalence for the five TTVs peaked at 43% (18 of 42) in children 2-4 years of age, subsequently declined, and again reached 42 % (74 of 178) among adults. TTV6 species-specific IgG predominated in children, whereas that for TTV13 predominated in adults. During a 3 year follow-up of the same children, both species-specific seroconversions and seroreversions occurred. This is the first EIA-based study of different TTVs, providing a new approach for seroepidemiology and diagnosis of TTV infections. Our data suggest that different TTVs in humans may differ in antiviral antibody profiles, infection patterns and epidemiology.

The role of porcine Torque teno virus (TTSuV) and porcine astrovirus (PAstV) in the etiology of grow-finish pigs is also mentioned. The review is based on the presentations from the 22nd International Pig Veterinary Society Congress, which took place in June 2012 in South Korea. The etiological significance of Brachyspira species was characterized: Brachyspira (B.) hyodysenteriae is a major pathogen in swine dysentery, B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia cause milder colitis, whereas B. murdochii and B. innocens are not pathogenic. For the identification of the species of the genus Brachyspira, several PCR-based assays were proposed, as well as a test involving the amplification of a highly variable region of the Brachyspira NADH Oxidase (nox) gene with PCR and then sequencing this PCR product for species identification. The results of these tests suggest that a potentially virulent new species of Brachyspira has been discovered, circulating among swine herds in North America. In relation to proliferative enteropathy, also a disease of the finishers, new laboratory diagnostic tests were presented and evaluated. Fecal PCR analysis, however, was not sufficiently sensitive for the diagnosis of all infections. Serological diagnostic methods were mentioned and evaluated, particularly for monitoring subclinically affected herds. Necropsy followed by the specific identification of L. intracellularis in the lessons by immunohistochemistry is the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy. According to the papers on porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) and Torque teno sus virus (TTsUV), these viruses have a high prevalence in fecal samples from pigs with clinical diarrhea. Further research is necessary, however, for any definite conclusions on their role in causing diarrhea in pigs.														0025-8628	0025-8628																			J	BCI:BCI201300590760	23689906			Torque Teno Mini Virus Infection in Chronic Cervicitis and Cervical Tumors in Isfahan, Iran		Changani, Leila; Bouzari, Majid (bouzari@sci.ui.ac.ir) ; Talebi, Ardeshir									Intervirology		2013		56	4	265-270	265	270							Objectives: Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) is classified as the Betatorquevirus genus of Anelloviridoe. Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population. Methods: 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: Totally 62% of the tested samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster. Conclusion: The presence of the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus. Copyright (C) 2013 S.

However, newly recognized blood-borne infectious agents can be threats to blood safety. In order to evaluate the prevalence some of these agents in blood donors, a systematic review was conducted. Data were obtained from published papers related to HGV, Torque Teno virus (TTV), HTLV, West Nile virus (WNV) and SEN virus (SEN-V). Based on these studies, the prevalence of HGV varied from 1 to 8.6% for anti-E2 and from 0 to 4.8% for HGV RNA. The prevalence of TTV DNA and HTLV-I varied from 2.7 to 79.5% and from 0.013 to 2.3%, respectively. The WNV-specific IgM antibody and WNV RNA are negative in blood donors. Prevalence rates of SEN-V in Iranian blood donors range from 23 to 90.8%. Consequences of these infectious agents for blood safety are different. Thus, the need to perform laboratory screening as well as effectiveness and efficiency of laboratory tests depend on pathogenicity level and epidemiological conditions of emerging infections. However, being prepared based on the current level of risk and interventions to reduce the risk can be effective in reducing the potential threat for blood supply.

In this study, the profiles of two swine manure treatment systems were evaluated: a solid-liquid separation step, followed by an anaerobic reactor, and an aerobic step (System 1); and a biodigester followed by serial lagoons (System 2). Both systems were described by the assessment of chemical, bacterial and viral parameters. The results showed that in System 1, there was reduction of chemicals (COD, phosphorus, total Kjeldhal nitrogen - TKN - and NH3), total coliforms and Escherichia colt; however, the same reduction was not observed for Salmonella sp. Viral particles were significantly reduced but not totally eliminated from the effluent. In System 2, there was a reduction of chemicals, bacteria and viruses with no detection of Salmonella sp., circovirus, parvovirus, and torque teno virus in the effluent. The chemical results indicate that the treated effluent can be reused for cleaning swine facilities.

Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage by this virus.														0304-8608	1432-8798	10.1007/s00705-012-1480-y																		J	BCI:BCI201300263984	23270330			Phylogenetic analysis of torque teno virus genome from Pakistani isolate and incidence of co-infection among HBV/HCV infected patients		Hussain, Tabinda; Manzoor, Sobia (lcianunique@yahoo.com) ; Waheed, Yasir; Tariq, Huma; Hanif, Khushbakht									Virology Journal		2012	DEC 28 2012	9		Article No.: 320	320								Background: Torque Teno Virus (TTV) was the first single stranded circular DNA virus to be discovered that infects humans. Although there have been numerous reports regarding the prevalence of TTV from other countries of South Asia, there is severe lack of information regarding its prevalence in Pakistan. Thus the present study compiles the first indigenous report to comprehensively illustrate the incidence of the virus in uninfected and hepatitis infected population from Pakistan. Another aim of the study was to present the sequence of full length TTV genome from a local isolate and compare it with the already reported genome sequences from other parts of the world.Methods: TTV DNA was screened in the serum of 116, 100 and 40 HBV infected, HCV infected and uninfected individuals respectively. Nearly full length genome of TTV was cloned from a HBV patient. The genome sequence was subjected to in-silico analysis using CLC Workbench, ClustalW, ClustalX and TreeView. Statistical analysis was carried out in SPSS v17.0.Results: Our results report that 89.7%, 90.0% and 92.5% of HBV, HCV patients and healthy control population were positive for TTV infection. TTV genome of 3603 bp was also cloned from a local isolate and given the identity of TPK01. The TTV genome sequence mentioned in this paper is submitted in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under the accession number JN980171. Phylogenetic analysis of TPK01 revealed that the Pakistani isolate has sequence similarities with genotype 23 and 22 (Genogroup 2).Conclusion: The results of the current study indicate that the high frequency of TTV viremia in Pakistan conforms to the reports from other areas of the world, wherever screening of TTV DNA was performed against 5'-UTR of the genome. The high sequence diversity among TTV genome sequences and the high frequency of prevalence makes it harder to study this virus in cellular systems.

Full-length sequences of TTSuVk2b were obtained, annotated and used in the phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that TTSuVk2b is a novel Anellovirus species within the genus Kappatorquevirus of the family Anelloviridae. Quantitative PCR techniques were developed to determine total TTSuV DNA quantities as well as the prevalence and viral DNA quantities of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b. The mean total TTSuV load in seven commercial sera was determined at 6.3 log(10) DNA copies ml(-1) of serum, with TTSuVk2b loads being the lowest at 4.5 log(10) DNA copies ml(-1) of serum. Subsequently, prevalence and loads of TTSuVs were determined in pig sera from 17 countries. TTSuVk2b prevalence ranged from 0 to 100% with viral loads from 3.3 to 4.6 log(10) copies ml(-1) of sera. TTSuVk2a, so far the only species in the genus Kappatorquevirus, has been linked to an economically important swine disease, namely post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Considering the grouping of TTSuVk2b. in the same genus as TTSuVk2a, TTSuVk2b prevalence and viral DNA load were determined in PMWS-affected animals and healthy counterparts. This revealed that TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b are not only genetically related, but also that their viral loads in serum are elevated in PMWS animals compared with those of healthy pen mates. In summary, the present work describes a novel TTSuV species including its genetic characterization, epidemiological assessment and potential disease association.

The detection rates of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were 78% and 50%, respectively, with 83% of the stillborn piglets positive for TTSuV1 or TTSuV2. TTSuV1 was detected highest in the liver (72%) followed by heart (56%), spleen (38%) and tonsils (38%) while TTSuV2 was detected highest in the tonsils (38%) followed by liver (33%), spleen (25%), and heart (17%). These results indicate that TTSuVs are commonly present but not equally distributed among the tissues of stillborn piglets.														1229-845X	1976-555X	10.4142/jvs.2012.13.4.425																		J	BCI:BCI201300021605	22532076			Torque teno sus virus infection in suckling piglets from Brazilian pig herds		Leme, Raquel de Arruda (quel-arruda@hotmail.com) ; Alfieri, Alice Fernandes; Alfieri, Amauri Alcindo									Tropical Animal Health and Production		2012	DEC 2012	44	8	1885-1890	1885	1890							Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is responsible for the infection of pig herds around the world. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of natural infection by both species of TTSuV in suckling piglets from major pig-producing regions of Brazil. Faecal samples (n = 135) from 1 to 3-week-old suckling piglets from the Southern, Southeast and Midwest regions of Brazil were analysed by PCR assay to detect TTSuV1 and 2. TTSuV1 and 2 DNA was identified in 65 (48.1 %) and 23 (17 %) of piglet faecal samples, respectively. Co-infection by both species of TTSuV was detected in 17 (12.6 %) samples. Detection of TTSuV1 was significantly higher than that of TTSuV2 in the three Brazilian regions together (p < 0.05). Based on age of animals, TTSuV1 infection was statistically higher than TTSuV2 in each age group (p < 0.05). For all of the age groups together, no statistical difference was detected in the number of TTSuV1 and 2 positive results (p > 0.05). These findings revealed that TTSuV infection has disseminated in pig herds from different geographic Brazilian regions, and the presence of TTSuV in suckling piglet faecal samples suggested the early infection by the virus and the potential of these animals in spreading the virus.

A total of 16 samples were collected, eight of influent (raw sewage, prior to treatment), and the other eight of the effluent (post-treatment sewage). Total and fecal coliform levels ranging from 3.6 x 10(4) to 4.4 x 10(7) MPN/100 mL and 2.9 x 10(3) to 1.7 x 10(7) MPN/100 mL, were detected in all samples. In raw sewage, HAdV (25%) and GARV (28.6%) viral genomes were detected. The analysis of effluent samples revealed the presence of HAdV (50%), EV (37.5%), and TTV (12.5%) genomic fragments. All samples, regardless of the month analysed, presented detection of a least one virus genus, except for in April. Higher virus detection rates were observed in treated sewage samples (62.5%), and in 80% of them (effluent positive samples) HAdV was detected. Results showed that improvements in sewage monitoring and treatment processes are necessary to reduce the viral and bacterial load on the environment in southern Brazil. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study showing the monitoring of viral genomes in influent and effluent samples from a STP located in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), southern Brazil.

We detected TTV DNA in 35% (7/20) of EBC samples collected from the mouth of one of the authors, demonstrating that TIT DNA is excreted in exhaled breath with moderate frequency. TTV DNA was detected also in oral EBC samples from 4 of 6 other authors, indicating that TTV DNA excretion in exhaled breath is not an exception but rather a common phenomenon. Furthermore, the same assay could amplify TTV DNA from room air condensate (RAC) samples collected at distances of 20 and 40 cm from a human face with 40 (8/20) and 35% (7/20) positive rates, respectively. TTV transmission has been reported to occur during infancy. These distances seem equivalent to that between an infant and its household members while caring for the infant. Taken together, it seems that exhaled breath is one of the possible transmission routes of TTV. We also detected TTV DNA in 25% (10/40) of RAC samples collected at a distance of more than 180 cm from any human face, suggesting the risk of airborne infection with TT V in a room.

The antigenic diversity among anelloviruses has never been assessed. Using torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) as a model, we describe here the first investigation of the antigenic relationships among different anelloviruses. Using a TTSuV genotype 1a (TTSuV1a) or TTSuV1b enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the respective putative ORF1 capsid antigen and TTSuV1-specific real-time PCR, the combined serological and virological profile of TTSuV1 infection in pigs was determined and compared with that of TTSuV2. TTSuV1 is likely not associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), because both the viral loads and antibody levels were not different between affected and unaffected pigs and because there was no synergistic effect of concurrent PCV2/TTSuV1 infections. We did observe a higher correlation of IgG antibody levels between anti-TTSuV1a and -TTSuV1b than between anti-TTSuV1a or -1b and anti-TTSuV2 antibodies in these sera, implying potential antigenic cross-reactivity. To confirm this, rabbit antisera against the putative capsid proteins of TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b, or TTSuV2 were generated, and the antigenic relationships among these TTSuVs were analyzed by an ELISA and by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using PK-15 cells transfected with one of the three TTSuV ORF1 constructs. The results demonstrate antigenic cross-reactivity between the two genotypes TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b but not between the two species TTSuV1a or -1b and TTSuV2. Furthermore, an anti-genogroup 1 human TTV antiserum did not react with any of the three TTSuV antigens. These results have important implications for an understanding of the diversity of anelloviruses as well as for the classification and vaccine development of TTSuVs.

This has resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method.Findings: Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids.Conclusions: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact.

Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda.Results: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing.Conclusions: Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bushpigs.

In this study the infective markers of TT virus, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were evaluated in patients with different types of leukemia in comparison with controls. In this cross sectional study Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA)-treated blood samples were collected from 163 patients with leukemia and 100 control between years: 2007-2011. Molecular prevalence of TT virus infection was evaluated in studied populations using in-house semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) protocol. HBsAg and HCVAb were analyzed in studied groups by third generation ELISA kits according to manufacturer's instructions. The genomic DNA of TT virus was found in 29 of 163 (17.8%) of leukemia patients and 2 of 100 (2%) of controls. HBsAg was diagnosed in 21 of 147 (14.3%) patients with leukemia and in 2 of 100 (2%) controls. HCVAb was diagnosed in 4 of 147 (2.7%) patients with leukemia and in none of controls. The co-infection of TT virus with HBV and with HCV was found in 4 of 147 (2.7%) and in 1 of 147 (0.7%) of patients with leukemia, respectively. Identification of high prevalence of TT virus infection in patients with leukemia compared with controls emphasize on possible association between TT virus infections with leukemia. Therefore evaluation of the prevalence of TT viral infection in larger groups of patients with long lasting follow up is suggested.			ramzi, mani/AAZ-7660-2020											1996-0808		10.5897/AJMR12.598																		J	BCI:BCI201200597892	22850961			The high prevalence of Torque teno virus DNA in blood donors and haemodialysis patients in southern Brazil		Massau, Aline; Martins, Cristiana; Nachtigal, Gilca Costa; Araujo, Anelise Bergmann; Rossetti, Maria Lucia; Niel, Christian; Dornelles da Silva, Claudia Maria (cmdornelles@gmail.com)									Memorias do Instituto Oswaldo Cruz		2012	AUG 2012	107	5	684-686	684	686							This study investigates the frequency of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in 150 blood donors and 77 patients requiring haemodialysis in southern Brazil. Plasma samples were screened for TTV DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalences of TTV among blood donors and patients requiring haemodialysis were 73.3% and 68.8%, respectively. The presence of TTV was correlated with age in the blood donors (p = 0.024). In haemodialysis patients, no association was found between TTV infection and the demographic parameters (age, sex and education), the duration of haemodialysis or a history of blood transfusion. This study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of TTV infection in Brazilian patients requiring haemodialysis.

Recent studies have shown an increased frequency of TTSuV2 in Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-associated diseases (PCVAD), which are endemic in many swine-producing countries, including Brazil. Coinfection with several other viral and bacterial agents results in an increased incidence of more severe PCVAD. Given the limited information on TTSuV and PCV2 coinfection, especially in Brazilian swine herds, this study made a preliminary estimation of the occurrence of coinfection in swine herds by testing samples from different categories. Between 2008 and 2009, 111 samples of feces and 23 serum samples from 5 swine herds were tested for PCV2 and TTSuVs and the results analyzed for associations between these agents. No significant differences in coinfection frequency were observed for PCV2 1 + TTSuV1 or for PCV2 1 TTSuV2 between nursery piglets (P = 0.730), growing pigs (P = 0.331), or sows (P = 0.472). However, a significant difference was observed for PCV2 1 TTSuV1 1 TTSuV2 between nursery piglets and growing pigs (P = 0.004; Fisher's exact test). Phylogenetic studies agreed with the grouping of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 into 2 different clades, with no distinct pattern of clustering of these isolates with the animal categories.

The objectives of this study were to develop novel and improve existing diagnostic methods for TTSuV infection and to investigate the prevalence of TTSuV species 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) in the USA. Three hundred and four blood or fetal thoracic fluid samples were collected from pigs on 40 US farms in 12 States. Samples were collected from fetuses and in pre-suckle neonates (n=73), suckling pigs (1-20 days of age; n=27), nursery pigs (21-55 days of age; n=60), finisher pigs (8-25 weeks of age; n=90) and adults (>25 weeks of age; n=54). Samples were tested by a new quantitative differential real-time PCR for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 DNA and by ELISA for detection of anti-TTSuV2-antibodies. The prevalence of TTSuV1 DNA ranged from 8.2% (fetuses and neonates) to 81% (finisher pigs) and the prevalence of TTSuV2 DNA ranged from 3.7% (suckling pigs) to 67% (finisher pigs). Evidence of fetal TTSuV infection was minimal. Mixed infection of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was seen in 6.7% of the nursery pigs, 52.2% of the finisher pigs, and 22.2% of the mature pigs. The prevalence of TTSuV1 was higher than that of TTSuV2. Anti-TTSuV2 antibodies were not detected in the fetuses and neonates and the seroprevalence of TTSuV2 was between 3.8% and 100% in growing pigs. The results of this study indicate that vertical transmission may not be a main route of TTSuV transmission in pigs in the USA. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Semen and organs from 17 boars were tested by nested and real-time PCR. PCV2 was amplified from semen (47%), lymph nodes (84.6%) and testicles (35.3%). TTV2 was amplified from 16/17 testis and 13/13 lymph nodes. TTV1 DNA was detected in fewer testicle samples (2/17), which were also TTV2 positive. Analyzed ovaries, follicular fluid and uteri of 83 culled sows showed TTV2, TTV1 and PCV2 from 49.3%, 30.1% and 6.0% of the sows, respectively. Sperm analysis indicated insignificant differences between PCV2 and TIVs positive and negative boars. The most frequent pathologic lesion in sows was endometritis (28.9%), but this was unassociated with PCV2 or TTVs detection.

Animal models combined with reverse genetic systems of anellovirus have not been developed. We report here the construction and initial characterization of full-length DNA clones of a porcine anellovirus, torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2), in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that five cell lines, including PK-15 cells, are free of TTSuV1 or TTSuV2 contamination, as determined by a realtime PCR and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-TTSuV antibodies. Recombinant plasmids harboring monomeric or tandem-dimerized genomic DNA of TTSuV2 from the United States and Germany were constructed. Circular TTSuV2 genomic DNA with or without introduced genetic markers and tandem-dimerized TTSuV2 plasmids were transfected into PK-15 cells, respectively. Splicing of viral mRNAs was identified in transfected cells. Expression of TTSuV2-specific open reading frame 1 (ORF1) in cell nuclei, especially in nucleoli, was detected by IFA. However, evidence of productive TTSuV2 infection was not observed in 12 different cell lines transfected with the TTSuV2 DNA clones. Transfection with circular DNA from a TTSuV2 deletion mutant did not produce ORF1 protein, suggesting that the observed ORF1 expression is driven by TTSuV2 DNA replication in cells. Pigs inoculated with either the tandem-dimerized clones or circular genomic DNA of U.S. TTSuV2 developed viremia, and the introduced genetic markers were retained in viral DNA recovered from the sera of infected pigs. The availability of an infectious DNA clone of TTSuV2 will facilitate future study of porcine anellovirus pathogenesis and biology.

In pigs, two distinct Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species have been described so far, being one of them linked to disease occurrence. Specifically, TTSuV2 loads in serum have been found increased in pigs suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Since this pathological condition is able to be controlled by means of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccination, it was hypothesized the possibility that such vaccination would have an impact on TTSuV2 prevalence and loads. A total of 150 pigs were divided in two study groups. Half of them received a PCV2 commercial vaccine, while the other half remained as non-vaccinated controls. PCV2 infection was monitored at 3-4, 8, 12, 16 and 21 weeks of age by means of an standard PCR, while TTSuV2 loads were determined at 8, 16 and 21 weeks of age by a quantitative PCR. No obvious PMWS clinical signs were observed among studied animals, although PCV2 infection was confirmed in both groups of pigs. Almost all pigs got TTSuV2 infection throughout the study period, independently of the PCV2 vaccination status of animals. Moreover, TTSuV2 load did not show significant differences between different pig groups at each sampling time, but mean viral load increased with age. Taking into account that previous results suggest that TTSuV2 load in serum is increased in the background of PMWS, the present study suggests that this is not the case in a PCV2 subclinical infection scenario. Therefore, vaccination of PCV2 subclinically infected pigs did not modify the outcome of TTSuV2 infection. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, the prevalence of TTSuVs in Iowa, the leading pork producing state in the U.S., was estimated by a duplex PCR. The PCR is capable of simultaneously detecting both teno sus viruses 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and 2). Based on an analysis of 300 random samples representing six major geographical regions of the state, the overall prevalence rates for TTSuV1 and 2 were 47.34% and 24.67% respectively while the combined prevalence rate was 52.33%. The epidemiological association of TTSuV1 and 2 with the common etiological agents of the porcine respiratory 0 disease complex (PRDC) namely porcine PRRSV, PCV2, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and swine influenza virus (SIV) was estimated in lung tissue derived from 45 pigs showing clinical signs of PRDC. Notably, 86.67% of the PRDC-suspect samples were positive for TTSuV1 in comparison to the baseline population prevalence rate of 47.34%. However, the prevalence of TTSuV2 (26.67%) was not significantly different. TTSuV1 was detected in 80.00%, 81.81%, 75.00% and 77.78% of the PRRSV, SIV, M. hyopneumoniae and PCV2 positive PRDC-suspect samples respectively. Our results indicate that TTSuV1 is strongly associated with clinical PRDC and support the hypothesis that TTSuVs might function as co-factors in PRDC. Further studies to define their possible role in the pathogenesis of swine respiratory diseases are warranted. Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, the molecular detection of these viruses was performed in samples of surface water collected from the Arroio Diluvio, a waterstream that crosses the city of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, receiving great volumes of non-treated sewage from a large urban area. Sampling was performed during 2009, in three different occasions (January, April and September). The highest detection rate was observed for EV (64.28%), followed by TTV (28.57%) and AdV (21.43%). Rotaviruses were not detected. More than on kind of tested virus was detected in five (35.71%) of 14 samples. January was the month with the highest viral detection rate, being all samples, collected in this month, positive for at least one group of tested virus.

TTSuV1-negative pigs were divided into four groups, and TTSuV1-positive pigs were divided into three groups. Experimental pigs were vaccinated with a PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) at 6 weeks of age and subsequently challenged with a virulent strain of PRRSV at 10 weeks of age. A TTSuV1-negative control group and an unvaccinated PRRS MLV control group were tested at the same time. The levels of antibody/cytokine and protective efficiency against PRRS MLV vaccine were evaluated. TTSuV1-infected/PRRSV-vaccinated pigs had lower levels of PRRSV antibody, as well as IFN-gamma, IL-10 and T lymphocyte proliferation, than the TTSuV1-uninfected/PRRSV-vaccinated group (P < 0.05, except IL-10) after vaccination at only one time point. TTSuV1-infected/PRRS MLV-vaccinated/PRRSV-challenged pigs had more severe clinical signs (P > 0.05), more macroscopic lung lesions (P < 0.05) and lower levels of PRRSV antibody (P < 0.05 at 7 to 14 days post-PRRSV-challenge) than TTSuV1-uninfected/PRRSV-vaccinated/PRRSV-challenged pigs. These data indicate that TTSuV1 natural infection has an adverse effect on the development of host immune responses, suppresses immunization by the PRRS MLV vaccine, and exacerbates PRRS to a certain extent in pigs.														0304-8608	1432-8798	10.1007/s00705-012-1249-3																		J	BCI:BCI201200410268	22361032			Molecular detection of Torque teno sus virus from tissues samples of sick pigs in China		Zhu, C.

The objective of this study was to assess the value of using oral fluids collected by barn personnel as a method of surveillance based on PCR testing. Approximately 12,150 pigs in 10 wean-to-finish barns on 10 farms were monitored for the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and Torque teno virus genogroups 1 (TTV1) and 2 (TTV2) by sampling oral fluid specimens. Oral fluid samples were collected from 6 pens at each site starting at the time of pig placement (similar to 3 weeks of age) and continuing thereafter at 2-week intervals for a period of 18 weeks. Data were analyzed both on a pen basis and barn basis. Overall, 508 (85%) samples were positive for PCV2, 73 (12%) for PRRSV, 46 (8%) for IAV, 483 (81%) for TTV2, and 155 (26%) for TTV1 during the study period. The estimated arithmetic means of the quantitative PCR-positive oral fluids for PCV2, PRRSV, and IAV were 1 x 10(4.62), 1 x 10(4.97), and 1 x 10(5.49) per ml. With a single exception, all barns were positive for PCV2 and TTV2 at every sampling point in the study. Virus detection varied among barns, particularly for IAV and PRRSV. The pen level, cumulative distribution of agent combinations between all 10 barns were statistically different. The most commonly observed patterns were PCV2 + TTV2 (239 pen samples, 40%), PCV2 + TTV1 + TTV2 (88 pen samples, 15%), and PCV2 alone (66 pen samples, 11%). This "proof-of-concept" project showed that a variety of viruses could be detected either intermittently or continuously in pig populations and demonstrated that barn herd virus status is highly variable, even among barns in the same production system. Oral fluid sampling is a promising approach for increasing the efficiency and cost effectiveness of virus surveillance in swine herds. (c) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study. Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) have been used as a model to evaluate the effects of global trade on viral heterogeneity, and how the movement of live pigs can affect the distribution and composition of virus populations. Seventeen countries from different parts of the world have been screened for TTSuV1 and TTSuvV2. High levels of genetic diversity have been found as well as two new TTSuV subtypes. A small fraction of this diversity (<5%) was related with spatial structure; however the majority (>50%) was best explained by the exchange of live pigs among countries, pointing to the direct relationship between the movement of hosts and the diversity of their accompanying viruses. Taking TTSuVs as sentinels, this study revealed that the distribution and diversity of comensal microflora in live animals subjected to global trade is shaped by the commercial movements among countries. In the case of TTSuVs, it appears that commercial movements of animals are eroding the genetic composition of the virus populations that may have been present in pig herds since their domestication.

E-mail: lucnak@ufmt.brThis study evaluated histological lesions in kidney samples from pigs with nephritis in two slaughterhouses in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Four hundred samples were subjected to histology, anti-porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) immunohistochemistry (IHC), anti-Leptospira sp. immunofluorescence (IF), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for PCV2, porcine parvovirus (PPV), and Torque teno virus type 1 and 2 (TTV1, TTV2) detection. Histological lesions were found in 81% of the samples, and mononuclear interstitial nephritis was the most frequent lesion (77.50%). A follicular pattern was observed in 40.97% of the interstitial nephritis lesions. PCV2, PPV, TTV1, and TTV2 were identified in the kidneys by PCR in 27.25%, 28.50%, 94%, and 87.5% of the samples, respectively. Leptospira sp. was not detected through IF. Infection by PCV2 (PCR) and the presence of histological lesions (P=0.008) and giant cells (P=0.0016) were significantly associated. An association was observed between the TTV2-TTV1 co-infection (P<0.0001) and the risk for pathogenesis. These findings indicated that PCV2, PPV, TTV1, and TTV2 were widely distributed among pigs in the local farms and that the presence of these agents should be considered in the differential diagnosis of kidneys with interstitial nephritis in pigs.

The detection rate of TTSuV1 in pSE increased from 14 to 90 days of age, but a progressive decline was observed from 120 to 150 days of age, while in pPBMC, a high value was maintained till the end or growing-finishing period. On the contrary, except in PBMCs at 30 days of age, high detection rates of TTSuV2 were found in both pSE and pPBMCs in all sampling ages. The detection rate of TTSuVs between pSE and pPBMCs was positively correlated at all sampling ages except for TTSuV1 at 150 days of age.

SI	85-102	85	102							In the past two decades or so, a number of viruses have emerged in the global swine population. Some, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), cause economically important diseases in pigs, whereas others such as porcine torque teno virus (TTV), now known as Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and related novel parvoviruses, porcine kobuvirus, porcine toroviruses (PToV) and porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses (PLHV), are mostly subclinical in swine herds. Although some emerging swine viruses such as swine hepatitis E virus (swine HEV), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and porcine sapovirus (porcine SaV) may have a limited clinical implication in swine health, they do pose a potential public health concern in humans due to zoonotic (swine HEV) or potential zoonotic (porcine SaV) and xenozoonotic (PERV, PLHV) risks. Other emerging viruses such as Nipah virus, Bungowannah virus and Menangle virus not only cause diseases in pigs but some also pose important zoonotic threat to humans. This article focuses on emerging and re-emerging swine viruses that have a limited or uncertain clinical and economic impact on pig health. The transmission, epidemiology and pathogenic potential of these viruses are discussed. In addition, the two economically important emerging viruses, PRRSV and PCV2, are also briefly discussed to identify important knowledge gaps.

SI	103-108	103	108							The newly established family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno viruses) and other animal species. The ones infecting domestic swine and wild boar are nowadays named Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV), which are small circular single-stranded DNA viruses highly prevalent in the pig population. So far, two genetically distinct TTSuV species are infecting swine. Both TTSuVs appear to efficiently spread by vertical and horizontal transmission routes; in fact, foetuses may be infected and the prevalence and viral loads increase by age of the animals. Detailed immunological studies on TTSuVs are still lacking, but it seems that there are no efficient immunological responses limiting viraemia. These viruses are currently receiving more attention due to the latest results on disease association. Torque teno sus viruses have been circulating unnoticed in pigs for a long time, and even considered non-pathogenic by themselves; there is increasing evidence that points to influence the development of some diseases or even affect their outcome. Such link has been mainly established with porcine circovirus diseases.

For this purpose, detection of TTSuV I and TTSuV2 (TTSuVs) in sera of 6 sows (Sows 1-6) at parturition and in sera of their newborn piglets immediately after birth without suckling colostrum was performed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). These sows were bred using semen that had tested negative for TTSuVs. In a TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-positive sow (Sow 1), TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were detected in 4 and 5 of 12 newborn littermates, respectively. In a TTSuV1-positive sow (Sow 2), TTSuVI was detected in 1 of 8 newborn littermates. In 4 TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-negative sows (Sows 3-6), TTSuV1 was detected in 6 out of the 25 newborn piglets of 3 sows (Sows 3-5), while TTSuVs were not detected in all 13 piglets of 1 sow (Sow 6). In addition, to investigate the possibility of a sow-to-piglet transmission pathway of TTSuV via colostrum, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in sera of 12 newborn piglets from Sows 1-3 were examined by nPCR. Immediately after birth without suckling colostrum, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were not detected in 10 and 8 of 12 newborn piglets, respectively; however, at 24 hr after suckling colostrum, TTSuV1 was detected in 6 piglets, while TTSuV2 was not detected in any piglets. These results confirmed the existence of a sow-to-fetus transmission pathway of TTSuV during normal pregnancy and suggested a possibility of sow-to-piglet transmission of TTSuV via colostrum.														0916-7250	1347-7439	10.1292/jvms.11-0155																		J	BCI:BCI201200371051	22384166			Epstein-Barr Virus Stimulates Torque Teno Virus Replication: A Possible Relationship to Multiple Sclerosis		Borkosky, Silvia S.; Whitley, Corinna; Kopp-Schneider, Annette; zur Hausen, Harald; de Villiers, Ethel-Michele (e.devilliers@dkfz.de)									PLoS One		2012	FEB 22 2012	7	2	Article No.: e32160	e32160								Viral infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has frequently been investigated as a possible candidate and torque teno virus (TTV) has also been discussed in this context. Nevertheless, mechanistic aspects remain unresolved. We report viral replication, as measured by genome amplification, as well as quantitative PCR of two TTV-HD14 isolates isolated from multiple sclerosis brain in a series of EBV-positive and -negative lymphoblastoid and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Our results demonstrate the replication of both transfected TTV genomes up to day 21 post transfection in all the evaluated cell lines. Quantitative amplification indicates statistically significant enhanced TTV replication in the EBV-positive cell lines, including the EBV-converted BJAB line, in comparison to the EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BJAB. This suggests a helper effect of EBV infections in the replication of TTV. The present study provides information on a possible interaction of EBV and TTV in the etiology and progression of multiple sclerosis.

Available studies clearly show that both viruses are widely distributed in the pig populations in America, Europe and Asia, although the impact of the infection is still unclear. Currently, the situation in domestic pig populations on the African continent is not known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible presence of the two viruses in domestic pigs in Uganda, and describe the phylogenetic relationships to those in the rest of the world.Results: Ninety-five serum samples from six districts in Uganda were used, and PCR using TTSuV1 and 2 specific primers for the UTR region was run for viral nucleic acid detection. The positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses performed in order to compare the Ugandan sequences with sequences from other parts of the world. The prevalence of TTSuV1 and 2 in the selected domestic pigs were estimated at 16.8% and 48.4% respectively, with co-infection found in 13.7%. The sequence identity was 90-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV1; and 63-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV2 sequences.Conclusion: This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV1 and 2 in domestic pigs in Uganda. These results highlight the importance of screening for emerging viruses given the globalisation of human activities.

Here, JCV reactivation in patients suffering from immune-mediated diseases after a long-term treatment with anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitor infliximab was investigated. Peripheral mononuclear blood cells (PBMC), plasma and urine samples were obtained from 61 immune-mediated diseases patients treated or not with infliximab in combination with steroid and other immunomodulators and from 20 healthy donors. JCV DNA was transiently detected in 12 PBMC of 40 patients at different doses of infliximab with a higher prevalence than that of the 21 patients untreated. Conversely, a stable JCV positivity in urine of treated and untreated patients was detected. Sequencing the noncoding control region (NCCR), all samples exhibited the archetype structure with few mutations in transcriptional factor binding regions. The consequence of anti-TNF-alpha treatment on viral persistence was examined monitoring Torquetenovirus viremia and investigating the TNF-alpha-induced microRNA regulators of transcriptional factors, with a binding site on NCCR. Although infliximab treatment in this study did not affect directly JCV reactivation, further investigation on host factor (s) regulated by it will be of warranty in the understanding the mechanism(s) that may affect viral persistence.			maggi, fabrizio/L-2974-2013; Maggi, Enrico/AAA-8045-2019	Maggi, Enrico/0000-0002-1824-3583; Maggi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-7489-5271										1355-0284	1538-2443	10.1007/s13365-012-0078-1																		J	BCI:BCI201200216074	22086157			Detection of torque teno midi virus/small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) in chronic cervicitis and cervical tumors in Isfahan, Iran		Salmanizadeh, Sharareh (sharare.salmanizade@yahoo.com) ; Bouzari, Majid (bouzari@sci.ui.ac.ir) ; Talebi, Ardeshir (talebi@med.mui.ac.ir)									Archives of Virology		2012	FEB 2012	157	2	291-295	291	295							Torque teno midi virus and small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) are members of the genus Gammatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae.

The system employed Plexor technology and detected 10(8)-10(1) copies per reaction of PCV2 DNA within a recombinant plasmid. The examination of clinical material showed consistent diagnostic sensitivity when samples contained more than 10(3) viral copies per reaction. Specificity of Plexor real-time PCR was confirmed using the porcine viruses PCV1, PRRSV, CSFV, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 employing the melting curve analysis of PCR products. The low values of coefficient of variation in the intra- (1.74%) and inter-assay (2.41%) analysis suggested that the assay was a highly reproducible. The Plexor real-time PCR was compared with three other real-time PCR systems (SYBR Green, TaqMan, LUX) with conclusion that it can be used as a method of choice for the detection and quantitation of PCV2.

Although cervical lymphadenitis is one of the major symptoms in KD, lymph node biopsy is rarely performed, because KD is usually diagnosed by clinical symptoms. A cervical lymph node biopsy was taken from a girl aged 1 year and 8 months who had suspected lymphoma, but she was diagnosed with KD after the biopsy. The cervical lymph node specimen was analyzed with multivirus real-time PCR that can detect > 160 viruses, and unbiased direct sequencing with a next-generation DNA sequencer to detect potential pathogens in the lymph node. Histologically, focal necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, including neutrophils and macrophages, was observed in the marginal zone of the cervical lymph node, which was compatible with the acute phase of KD. Multivirus real-time PCR detected a low copy number of torque teno virus in the sample. Comprehensive direct sequencing of the cervical lymph node biopsy sample sequenced more than 8 million and 3 million reads from DNA and RNA samples, respectively. Bacterial genomes were detected in 0.03% and 1.79% of all reads in DNA and RNA samples, respectively. Although many reads corresponded to genomes of bacterial environmental microorganisms, Streptococcus spp. genome was detected in both DNA (77 reads) and RNA (2,925 reads) samples.

In a cross-sectional study, we investigated if signs of B cells exhaustion and impaired viral immune surveillance are present in a cohort of 43 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients with preserved CD4(+) T cell counts (>350 cells/mu L) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) untreated. A dramatic expansion of exhausted tissue-like memory B cells (CD10(-)CD21(low)CD27(-)) was observed. B cells alteration was related to an increase in Torque teno virus (TTV) load, used as surrogate marker of immune function. Successfully HAART-treated patients showed normalization of B cell subpopulations frequency and TTV load.

These results show that TTSuVs are highly seroprevalent in both PMWS-suspected pigs and PCV2-vaccinated normal pigs with TTSuV2 being more seroprevalent in the former than in the latter.														0916-7250	1347-7439	10.1292/jvms.11-0233																		J	BCI:BCI201200209381	22119629			A multiple SYBR Green I-based real-time PCR system for the simultaneous detection of porcine circovirus type 2, porcine parvovirus, pseudorabies virus and Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 in pigs		Perez, Lester J.; Perera, Carmen L.; Frias, Maria T.; Nunez, Jose I.; Ganges, Llilianne; Diaz de Arce, Heidy (heidydal@yahoo.es)									Journal of Virological Methods		2012	JAN 2012	179	1	233-241	233	241							Multiple viral infections are common in pigs under intensive production conditions. All five of the viruses included in this study are associated with multifactorial diseases that cause significant economic losses in swine farming worldwide. The development is described of a novel multiple real-time PCR system based on the use of SYBR Green I that allows the simultaneous detection and differentiation of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), porcine parvovirus (PPV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Torque teno sus virus species 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) in pigs. The method was able to distinguish between all five viral agents, and tests of other DNA viruses proved the specificity of the system. The multiple real-time PCR system was sensitive, kas the limits of detection ranged from 3.65 x 10(3) to 5.04 x 10(3) copies of DNA template per reaction. The coefficients of variation were low for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. In addition, the results of the multiple real-time PCR system tests were 100% consistent with previous results based on specific PCR assay testing of field samples. This method could be a useful tool for epidemiological studies and disease management. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These are as follows: Adenoviruses, Rotaviruses, Reoviruses, Picornaviruses, Enteroviruses, Caliciviruses and Astroviruses. Their common properties are: usually low and facultative pathogenicity, dependent on the level of innate immunity of the animal; participation as one of the factors of a multifactorial etiology, usually together with several taxonomically different viruses; contribution to the emergence of clinical symptoms in pigs, together with an unsatisfactory level of welfare which frequently occurs in large farms based on industrial technologies; very often occurring symptomless infections and carriership of these opportunistic microorganisms in healthy animals. These microorganisms predominantly represent RNA viruses and express a high frequency of variability of their genomes. As a consequence this may contribute to the emergence of new species, quasi-species, or variants in the enumerated groups of viruses, in addition to variants also pathogenic for humans. At present it is difficult to define which species or variants of the mentioned groups of viruses besides the mentioned environmental factors initiate the multifactorial, enteric disease of pigs. However it may not be excluded that Torque teno or PCV2 viruses and some bacterial enteropathogens, particularly E. coli serotypes pathogenic for swine, may be taken into account.														0025-8628	0025-8628																			J	BCI:BCI201200463346	22171963			Histopathological investigation in porcine infected with torque teno sus virus type 2 by inoculation		Mei, Miao; Zhu, Ling; Wang, Yun; Xu, Zhiwen (abtcxzw@126.com) ; Zhao, Ling; Peng, Xi; Wu, Yunfei; Li, Song; Guo, Wanzhu									Virology Journal		2011	DEC 15 2011	8		Article No.: 545	545								Background: Porcine torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a small icosahedral and non-enveloped virus which contains a single-stranded (ssDNA), circular and negative DNA genome and infects mainly vertebrates and is currently classified into the 'floating' genus Anellovirus of Circoviridae with two species. Viral DNA of both porcine TTSuV species has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species has been documented in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, there exists no information about histopathological lesions caused by infection with porcine TTSuV2.Methods: Porcine liver tissue homogenate with 1 ml of 6.91 x 10(7) genomic copies viral loads of porcine TTSuV2 that had positive result for torque teno sus virus type 2 and negative result for torque teno sus virus type 1 and porcine pseudorabies virus type 2 were used to inoculate specific pathogen-free piglets by intramuscular route and humanely killed at 3,7,10,14,17,21 and 24 days post inoculation (dpi), the control pigs were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of sterile DMEM and humanely killed the end of the study for histopathological examination routinely processed, respectively.Results: All porcine TTSuV2 inoculated piglets were clinic asymptomatic but developed myocardial fibroklasts and endocardium, interstitial pneumonia, membranous glomerular nephropathy, and modest inflammatory cells infiltration in portal areas in the liver, foci of hemorrhage in some pancreas islet, a tiny amount red blood cells in venule of muscularis mucosae and outer longitudinal muscle, rarely red blood cells in the microvasculation and infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and eosinophils) of tonsil and hilar lymph nodes, infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes and necrosis or degeneration and focal gliosis of lymphocytes in the paracortical zone after inoculation with porcine TTSuV2-containing tissue homogenate.Conclusions: Analysis of these presentations revealed that porcine TTSuV2 was readily transmitted to TTSuV-negative swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in specific pathogen-free piglets inoculated with porcine TTSuV2. Those results indicated no markedly histopathological changes happened in those parenchymatous organs, especially the digestive system and immune system when the specific pathogen-free pigs were infected with porcine TTSuV2, hence, to some extent, it was not remarkable pathological agent for domestic pigs at least. So, porcine TTSuV2 could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious etiology of swine. This study indicated a directly related description of lesions responsible for TTSuV2 infection in swine.

Diagnostic investigations consistently detected porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) from diseased tissues. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that the infectious agent was a PCV2 type termed "PCV2b". Prior to late 2004, only the PCV2a type, but not PCV2b, had been reported in North America. In this communication, we produce severe postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in gnotobiotic pigs using infectious PCV2a and PCV2b generated from DNA clones constructed from field isolates identified in the 2005 outbreak. Clinical signs exhibited by diseased pigs included anorexia, dyspnea and listlessness. Mortality was typically observed within 12 h of onset of dyspnea. The most striking microscopic lesions in affected animals were severe hepatic necrosis and depletion of germinal centers in lymph nodes with associated abundant PCV2 viral antigen. Clinical signs and lesions observed in these studies were comparable to those reported in experiments with gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with a PCV2a isolate while concurrently receiving immune-stimulation or coinfection with porcine parvovirus or torque teno virus. The animals in these studies were confirmed to be free of detectable porcine parvovirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, swine hepatitis E virus, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Seven out of 24 PCV2 inoculated pigs had a detectable congenital torque teno virus infection with no correlation to clinical disease. Thus, in these studies, both PCV2a and PCV2b isolates were singularly capable of inducing high mortality in the absence of any detectable infectious co-factor. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, TTVs have been eventually linked to human diseases. TTVs infecting pigs, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), have been recently associated to porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). To get more insights into such potential disease association, the aim of this study was to quantify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral loads in serum of pigs affected by two PCVDs, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Such study was carried out by means of a newly developed real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method. Both TTSuVs were highly prevalent among studied pigs. TTSuV2 viral loads were significantly higher in PMWS affected animals, further supporting the previously suggested association between TTSuV2 and PMWS. On the contrary, TTSuV1 prevalence and loads were not related with the studied PCVDs. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

These sequences were classified by the formerly used genogroup-genotype system as well as by the newly accepted species classification by aligning with the corresponding region of the type sequences of the 29 TTV species. All sequences obtained during the study clustered together with the TTV1 type sequence; to express diversity within TTV1, genotypes and subtypes of the former classification were used.The commonest subtypes were 2c followed by 2b, 1a and 1b. Subtypes 2b and 2c were evenly distributed among cervical samples; subtype 1a was more frequent in patients with cervical atypia or cancer. Subtypes 2c was more frequent than 2b in head and neck lesions. In conclusion, genotype and even subtype distribution may be important in association with diseases, therefore using this classification for characterization of intraspecies diversity of TTV1 is proposed.														1217-8950	1588-2640	10.1556/AMicr.58.2011.4.8																		J	BCI:BCI201200105830	22152290			Polymicrobial respiratory disease in pigs		Opriessnig, T.

Animal Health Research Reviews		2011	DEC 2011	12	2	133-148	133	148							Respiratory disease in pigs is common in modern pork production worldwide and is often referred to as porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). PRDC is polymicrobial in nature, and results from infection with various combinations of primary and secondary respiratory pathogens. As a true multifactorial disease, environmental conditions, population size, management strategies and pig-specific factors such as age and genetics also play critical roles in the outcome of PRDC. While non-infectious factors are important in the initiation and outcome of cases of PRDC, the focus of this review is on infectious factors only. There are a variety of viral and bacterial pathogens commonly associated with PRDC including porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (MHYO) and Pasteurella multocida (PMULT). The pathogenesis of viral respiratory disease is typically associated with destruction of the mucocilliary apparatus and with interference and decrease of the function of pulmonary alveolar and intravascular macrophages. Bacterial pathogens often contribute to PRDC by activation of inflammation via enhanced cytokine responses. With recent advancements in pathogen detection methods, the importance of polymicrobial disease has become more evident, and identification of interactions of pathogens and their mechanisms of disease potentiation has become a topic of great interest. For example, combined infection of pigs with typically low pathogenic organisms like PCV2 and MHYO results in severe respiratory disease. Although the body of knowledge has advanced substantially in the last 15 years, much more needs to be learned about the pathogenesis and best practices for control of swine respiratory disease outbreaks caused by concurrent infection of two or more pathogens. This review discusses the latest findings on polymicrobial respiratory disease in pigs.														1466-2523	1475-2654	10.1017/S1466252311000120																		J	BCI:BCI201500705426	21482428			Molecular detection of Torque teno sus virus in lymphoid tissues in concomitant infections with other porcine viral pathogens		Perez, Lester J.; Diaz de Arce, Heidy; Frias, Maria T.; Perera, Carmen L.; Ganges, Llilianne; Nunez, Jose I.

Methods: The sequence of ORF1 protein of Torque teno virus was analyzed by bioinformatics using some web tools. Results: The most likely cleavage site was between position 14aa and 15aa and signal peptide may be position 1aa-14aa. Two possible transmembrane helices from inside to outside and three possible transmembrane helices from outside to inside were found. The position 509 (NKTN) was the potential N-glycosylation site. The speculative molecular weight of TTV ORF1 protein, which may be a king of unstable protein was 88 705.7 Da. 1aa-91aa and 278aa-361aa were localized in non-regular secondary structure region. Conclusions: TTV ORF1 protein may be a nuclear protein which contains two non-regular secondary structure region. 265aa to 486aa and 510aa to 679aa may be the two approciate fragments to construct the plasmids, which would be prepared for the future hybrid experiments to study the functional positions of the protein and the interactions between TTV and its hosts.

One difficulty has been the need to propagate cancer cells in vitro to produce the infectious agent in detectable quantity. We hypothesized that genome amplification from small numbers of cells could be adapted to circumvent this difficulty A patient with concomitant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and polycythemia vera (PV) requiring therapeutic phlebotomy donated a large amount of phlebotomized blood to test this possibility. Using genome amplification methods, we identified a new isolate (BIS8-17) of torque teno virus (TTV) 10. The presence of blood isolate sequence 8-17 (BIS8-17) in the original plasma was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), validating the approach, since TTV is a known plasma virus. Subsequent PCR testing of plasmas from additional patients showed that BIS8-17 had a similar incidence (similar to 20%) in CLL (n = 48) or PV (n = 10) compared with healthy controls (n = 52). CLL cells do not harbor BIS8-17; PCR did not detect it in CLL peripheral blood genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (n = 20). CLL patient clinical outcome or prognostic markers (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region (IGHV) mutation, CD38 or zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70kDa (ZAP-70)) did not correlate with BIS8-17 infection. Although not causative to our knowledge, this is the first reported isolation and detection of TTV in either CLL or PV.TTV could serve as a covirus with another infectious agent or TTV variant with rearranged genetic components that contribute to disease pathogenesis. These results prove that this method identifies infectious agents and provides an experimental methodology to test correlation with disease.

Investigations have demonstrated that a variety of infections not only cause infectious myopathies but also could be possible triggers for IIM. This review summarizes published studies on the possible roles of infections in inflammatory muscle disease.Recent findingsMany infectious agents have been linked to the development of IIMs via case reports, epidemiologic investigations, and animal models. Additional agents possibly involved in triggering the development of IMMs have been recently described, including Torque teno virus (TTV) and Borrelia burgdorferi. Novel animal models of myositis have been recently developed using Leishmania infantum or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). New technologies to assess infectious agents include high-throughput methods for pathogen identification and novel approaches to identify gene expression of pathogens in tissues.SummaryUnderstanding the causes of IIMs remains limited in part due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these disorders. Although no definitive studies have yet linked infectious agents with IIMs, additional evidence is accumulating and novel technologies may allow improved understanding of the roles of infections in IIMs and for possible future therapeutic and preventive measures.

Following transfection of three TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 full-length ORF (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3) expression constructs into porcine kidney cells, alternative splice variants encoding new TTSuV protein isoforms were identified for the first time. Proteins encoded from ORF1 and ORF3 were localized in the nucleoli of porcine kidney cells and that of ORF2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus excluding the nucleoli. The subcellular localization of the different protein isoforms was not only similar between distinct TTSuV species but also to the ones described in human Torque teno virus (TTV). Results of the present in vitro study were not based on full-length viral clones but suggested that alternative splicing strategy to generate TTSuV protein isoforms probably occurs in vivo.

In pigs, two different TTV species have been described so far. Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuVs have lately been linked to postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In the present study. TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 prevalence and DNA loads in longitudinally collected serum samples of healthy and PMWS affected pigs from Spanish conventional, multi-site farms were analyzed. Serum samples were taken at 1, 3, 7,11 and around 15 weeks of age (age of PMWS outbreak) and viral DNA loads determined by quantitative PCR. For both TTSuV species, percentage of viremic pigs increased progressively over time, with the highest prevalence in animals of about 15 weeks of age. TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral DNA loads in healthy and TTSuV1 loads in PMWS affected animals increased until 11 weeks of age declining afterwards. On the contrary, TTSuV2 DNA loads in PMWS affected pigs increased throughout the sampling period. It seems that TTSuV species differ in the in vivo infection dynamics in PMWS affected animals.

One representative positive isolate designated LDL was randomly selected, cloned and sequenced. The complete genome of the LDL Chinese strain was 2799 nucleotides in length and contains three open reading frames (ORFs), which encode 576 (ORF1), 101 (ORF2), and 243 (ORF3) aa. Compared with the human and other animal TTV genomes, the genome of the LDL strain is clearly smaller and shares 95% identity with Japanese cf-TTV10 strain (AB076002). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the present Chinese Torque teno canis virus LDL strain was also closely clustered with the previous Japanese cf-TTV10 strain, and formed a different branch together with Torque teno sus viruses 1 and 2 compared with other Torque teno viruses, Torque teno mini virus, and Torque teno midi virus.

It has a single-stranded, circular, negative-sense DNA genome. Its pathogenic role in human disease remains to be confirmed. In this study, viral shedding, molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTMDV/SAV were studied in human body fluids. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with acute respiratory disease were tested by PCR/nested PCR for TTMDV/SAV in two seasons (2005/2006, 2006/2007). Two years later, additional urine, stool, and serum samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from eight symptomless children for follow-up investigation. Forty-three (46.7%) of the 92 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected contained TTMDV/SAV. High genetic diversity was observed; however, identical sequences were also detected in two patients. The mean age of the infected children was 3 years (1 months-8 years), and 58% of them were female. Co-infection with RSV was detected in 23% of the samples. In a follow-up study, nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum of six (75%), stool samples of four (50%) and urine samples of two (25%) of the eight children were anellovirus-positive. None of the anellovirus sequences were identical in the two collection periods, but identical sequences were detected in different body fluids collected at the same time from the same child. TTMDV/SAVs shedding was detected in four human body fluids. As a consequence, it is possible that generalized infection and fecal/uro-oral transmission of TTMDV/SAV occur. TTMDV/SAVs are frequently present in nasopharyngeal aspirates, although the variants may only be transient agents. Further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis and pathogenic role of TTMDV/SAV.

The isolation of a large number of TTV genomes (TTV Heidelberg [TTV-HD]) of 26 TTV types is reported. Several isolates from the same type indicate sequence variation within open reading frame 1 (ORF1), resulting in considerably modified open reading frames. We demonstrate in vitro replication of 12 full-length genomes of TTV-HD in 293TT cells. Propagation of virus was achieved by several rounds of infections using supernatant and frozen whole cells of initially infected cells. Replication of virus was measured by PCR amplification and transcription analyses. Subgenomic molecules (mu TTV), arising early during propagation and ranging in size from 401 to 913 bases, were cloned and characterized. Propagation of these mu TTV in in vitro cultures was demonstrated in the absence of full-length genomes.														0022-538X	1098-5514	10.1128/JVI.02472-10																		J	BCI:BCI201100483354	21471095			Viral Infection in Acute Exacerbation of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis		Wootton, Sharon Chao; Kim, Dong Soon (dskim@amc.seoul.kr) ; Kondoh, Yasuhiro; Chen, Eunice; Lee, Joyce S.; Song, Jin Woo; Huh, Jin Won; Taniguchi, Hiroyuki; Chiu, Charles; Boushey, Homer; Lancaster, Lisa H.; Wolters, Paul J.; DeRisi, Joseph; Ganem, Don; Collard, Harold R.

An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis isanepisode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation.Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis.Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and highthroughput cDNA sequencing.Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses.Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.

(xjmeng@vt.edu)									Virus Research		2011	JUN 2011	158	1-2	79-88	79	88							Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV) has a single-stranded circular DNA genome and is currently classified into a new genus lotatorquevirus with two species in a newly established family Anelloviridae. Viral DNA of both porcine TTV species (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species has been documented in the United States and in Europe. However, the prevalence of specific TTSuV antibodies in pigs remains unknown. In this study, the putative ORF1 capsid protein from TTSuV2 isolate PTTV2c-VA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant ORF1 protein was used as the antigen for the development of Western blot and indirect ELISA to detect TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies in pig sera. The results revealed a relatively high rate of seropositivity to TTSuV2 in conventional pigs from different sources but not in gnotobiotic pigs. Overall, pigs with undetectable TTSuV2 viral load were more likely to have a lower anti-TTSuV2 antibody level. An analysis of 10 conventional pigs during a 2-month period showed that decreased viral loads or presumed virus clearance were associated with elevated anti-ORF1 IgG antibody levels. Interestingly, porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD)-affected pigs had a significantly lower level of TTSuV2 antibody than PCVAD-unaffected pigs (p < 0.01). This is the first study to establish essential serodiagnostic tools for investigation of TTSuV seroprevalence and infection dynamics, which will help elucidate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV infection in pigs.

TTV isolates have been classified into five main phylogenetic groups (1-5) showing a large genetic distance between them. The presence of TTV has been detected in feces. However, whether all five TTV genogroups are excreted in feces and the frequency of these events are presently unknown. The presence of TTV DNA was assessed in feces from 135 Brazilian (0-90 years old) patients with gastroenteritis by using three PCR methods, including real-time PCR. One hundred twenty one (91.1%) samples were positive with at least one method. Using a genogroup-specific assay, it was shown that all genogroups were present. Thirty-seven (27.4%), 27(20.0%), 57 (42.2%), 29 (21.5%), and 33 (24.4%) fecal samples contained TTV isolates belonging to genogroups 1-5, respectively. Coinfections with two, three, four, and five TTV genogroups were found in 23 (17.0%), 15 (11.1%),7 (5.2%), and 7 (5.2%) fecal samples, respectively. Thus, 52 (38.5%) samples contained more than one TTV genogroup. Viral loads ranged from 2.6 to 6.5 log genome equivalents per gram of feces. However, only moderate variations of viral load were noted depending on genogroup and number of coinfecting TTV genogroups. These results show a high prevalence and a diversity of TTV isolates in feces. J. Med. Virol. 83:1107-1111, 2011. (c) 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Despite the low nucleotide identity reported, the genomic organization and transcriptional profiles of TTVs are similar. The nucleotide diversity for TTSuV1 was higher than TTSuV2, and the pattern of mutation among the ORFs was also different. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses support the proposed division of TTV into two species. TTSuV1 showed high levels of variability (> 30%), with three different types (the third described for the first time) that may display a geographical structure. In contrast, TTSuV2 showed lower levels of variability (< 15%), and no different types could be described. Larger values for the ratios of synonymous (dS) to non-synonymous (dN) base substitutions (dS/dN) were reported for the ORFs pointing to a certain level of selective constraint in TTV genomes.

Presently, two TTSuV genogroups are recognized: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuV genomes have been found in commercial vaccines for swine, enzyme preparations and other drugs containing components of porcine origin. However, no studies have been made looking for TTSuV in cell cultures. In the present study, a search for TTSuV genomes was carried out in cell culture lineages, in sera used as supplement for cell culture media as well as in trypsin used for cell disaggregation. DNA obtained from twenty-five cell lineages (ten from cultures in routine multiplication and fifteen from frozen ampoules), nine samples of sera used in cell culture media and five batches of trypsin were examined for the presence of TTSuV DNA. Fifteen cell lineages, originated from thirteen different species contained amplifiable TTSuV genomes, including an ampoule with a cell lineage frozen in 1985. Three cell lineages of swine origin were co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. One batch of trypsin contained two distinct TTSuV1 plus one TTSuV2 genome, suggesting that this might have been the source of contamination, as supported by phylogenetic analyses of sequenced amplicons. Samples of fetal bovine and calf sera used in cell culture media did not contain amplifiable TTSuV DNA. This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV as contaminants in cell lineages. In addition, detection of the viral genome in an ampoule frozen in 1985 provides evidence that TTSuV contamination is not a recent event. These findings highlight the risks of TTSuV contamination in cell cultures, what may be source for contamination of biological products or compromise results of studies involving in vitro multiplied cells.

TTV, belongs to the Genus Anellovirus, Family Circoviridae, is a small, non-enveloped, single-stranded and circular DNA virus. TTV can be divided into geno-group 1 and 2 (TTV-1/2) and may play an important role in causing swine diseases. During this study from year 2008 to 2009, 480 serum samples (120 each from 6-, 10-, 16-, and 22-week old pigs) collected from thirty-three pig farms were examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and nested-PCR (nPCR) targeting a fragment of the viral untranslated region (UTR). Genetic sequencing was also performed from at least one of the positive samples from each farm. The nPCR results for the presence of TTV-1/2 were 96.88 % /56.3% positive for all 480 pigs, and the positive rates for 6-, 10-, 16- and 22-week old pigs were 94.2 %/30.8%, 97.5 %/61.7 %, 96.7 %/67.6 %, and 99.2 %/65 % respectively. Forty-eight TTV-1 and forty-five TTV-2 nPCR positive samples were then analyzed by DNA sequencing. Comparisons of the DNA sequences with the reference Sd-TTV1p (AY823990) and Sd-TTV2p (AY823991) showed homologies ranged from 93 to 100% and 92.7 to 100 % respectively.

Journal of Hospital Infection		2011	MAR 2011	77	3	242-247	242	247							The presence of pathogenic viruses in healthcare settings represents a serious risk for both staff and patients. Direct viral detection in the environment poses significant technical problems and the indirect indicators currently in use suffer from serious limitations. The aim of this study was to monitor surfaces and air in hospital settings to reveal the presence of hepatitis C virus, human adenovirus, norovirus, human rotavirus and torque teno virus by nucleic acid assays, in parallel with measurements of total bacterial count and haemoglobin presence. In total, 114 surface and 62 air samples were collected. Bacterial contamination was very low (<1 cfu/cm(2)) on surfaces, whereas the 'medium' detected value in air was 282 cfu/m(3). Overall, 19 (16.7%) surface samples tested positive for viral nucleic acids: one for norovirus, one for human adenovirus and 17 (14.9%) for torque teno virus (TTV). Only this latter virus was directly detected in 10 air samples (16.1%). Haemoglobin was found on two surfaces. No relationship was found between viral, biochemical or bacterial indicators. The data obtained confirm the difficulty of assessing viral contamination using bacterial indicators. The frequent detection of TTV suggests its possible use as an indicator for general viral contamination of the environment. (C) 2010 The Hospital Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The sera were analysed for the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2. Furthermore, the correlation between TTV and PCV-2 was investigated. 62.1 % of the pigs were positive for TTV1 and/or TTV2 by PCR. 21.7% of the samples were positive for TTV1 and TTV2, 16.2 % only for TTV1 and 23.3 % only for TTV2. In 80.7% of the investigated farms at least one animal was TTV positive. In the growing and fattening period significantly more pigs were positive for TTV than in other age classes. A positive association was found between TTV1 and IgM against PCV-2, between TTV2 and PCV-2 results by in situ hybridisation (ISH) as well as TTV1 and TTV2 and PCV-2 results by qPCR. A significant correlation could also be seen between the diagnosis "porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC)" and the detection of TTV, whereas there was none to the diagnosis "porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS)": In the present study, TTV was detected in Austria for the first time.

SI	132-140	132	140							Genetic and environmental factors jointly determine the susceptibility to develop Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility to MS. Similar to other autoimmune diseases. HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes. Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and for non-MHC regions. The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been associated with MS development. Current data suggest that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which predisposes for MS development. In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS.

Life Science Journal-Acta Zhengzhou University Overseas Edition		2011		8	3	165-172	165	172							Introduction: Epidemiological studies have shown that TTV is described worldwide in various populations. The prevalence of TTV viremia in healthy adults of developed countries is in the range of 1-34%. Prevalence reported from third world countries was found to be higher, typically 40-70%. In people who have received multiple blood transfusion; the virus is almost universally present with more than one subtype in each individual. Objectives: This study was carried out to determine the incidence of TTV infection among children's, wastewater, and drinking water, also genotyping of detected TTV strains circulating in the studied samples collected from Cairo. Subjects and Methods: stool samples were collected from 152 Children's with age range from 6 months to 12 years. Also, 45 wastewater samples and 45 drinking water samples were collected monthly from inlet and outlet from wastewater treatment plant (Zenin) and from El-Giza drinking water treatment plant. Collected samples were submitted to semi-nested PCR for amplification of 3' non translated region of TTV. The expected fragment sizes of PCR products were 390 bp and 271 bp for the first and second round of PCR, respectively. PCR products, of 2nd round of some positive samples, were purified for nucleotide sequence analysis in both directions. Fragments nucleotide sequences were compared to sequences derived from the corresponding TTV genome of the same regions deposited in the Gene Bank. Results and Conclusion: Obtained data showed that the incidence of TTV in children's stool samples was 59.2% (90/152), and in sewage samples was 64.4% (29/45), while it was 17.8% (8/45) in drinking water samples. Statistical analysis indicated that there no significant difference in TTV infection between male and female in infant and early childhood age groups. The phylogenic tree of positive samples confirmed that the isolated virus sequencing was 100% of nucleotide identity to TTV isolate isolated in Germany in 2001 and deposited in the GeneBank with accession no. AF435014, and the sequence of TTV isolated in the present study belong to TTV genotype 28.				zarouk, waheba/0000-0002-9266-2567										1097-8135																				J	BCI:BCI201100174252	21074236			Evaluation of pepper mild mottle virus, human picobirnavirus and Torque teno virus as indicators of fecal contamination in river water		Hamza, Ibrahim Ahmed (ibrahimvnrc@yahoo.com) ; Jurzik, Lars; Ueberla, Klaus; Wilhelm, Michael									Water Research		2011	JAN 2011	45	3	1358-1368	1358	1368							A reliable indicator is needed to predict and reduce the risk of infection associated with fecal contamination of surface water. Since Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), human picobirnaviruses (hPBV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) have been detected at substantial levels in human feces, we explored whether detection of nucleic acids of these viruses is a suitable indicator of fecal contamination in river water. From September 2008 to December 2009, water samples (n = 111) were collected from the Ruhr and Rhine rivers and from the influents and effluents of a wastewater plant (n = 12). Quantitative real time (RT-) PCR was used to determine the abundance of PMMoV, hPBV, and TTV in comparison to human adenoviruses (HAdV) and human polyomaviruses (HPyV) that are frequently detected in surface water and were previously proposed as indicators. While PMMoV was detected in all river water samples, the other viruses were detected less frequently. The concentration of the studied viruses in positive river water ranged from 5 x 10(1) to 1.07 x 10(6) genome equivalents per liter (gen.equ./l). All wastewater samples were positive for PMMoV, HAdV and HPyV, while TTV and hPBV were detected in 6/12 and 3/12 of samples, respectively. To determine if PMMoV is specific to human-derived fecal waste, fecal samples from human (n = 20) and animal (n = 53) were also tested. In contrast to the ubiquity of PMMoV in human feces (19/20) the virus was only detected at low concentration in a minority of the animal fecal samples tested (7/15 from chicken, 1/10 from Geese and 1/6 from cows). Therefore, in this setting TTV and hPBV do not seem to be suitable indicators of fecal contamination in water. Whereas, the high excretion level and dissemination of PMMoV in human sewage and river water suggest that PMMoV could be a promising indicator of fecal pollution in surface water.

In swine, two genetically distinct species have been identified, Torque teno sus virus I (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). The aim of the present work was to study the tissue distribution of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in pigs of different ages, including foetuses at the second and last thirds of gestation, and animals at 5 days and 5, 15 and 24 weeks of age. Investigated tissues included brain, lung, mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow. Viral DNA from tissue extractions were tested by a comparative PCR for the presence of TTSuVs. Overall, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 species were found in all tissues tested, with variations depending on age, and following similar infection dynamics in all tissues, increasing progressively in prevalence and virus load over time. The highest prevalence was found at 5 weeks of age and maintained afterwards, and the highest loads of virus in the different tissues were seen in the oldest animals (15 and 24 weeks of age). No animals were negative to TTV, including foetuses. In conclusion, the present study indicated that swine TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 can be found virtually in all body tissues of the pig. Both swine TTV species were present in high levels in almost all older animals, while viral negative tissues were only found in 5-week-old and 5-day-old pigs, and foetuses. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

International Urology and Nephrology		2010	DEC 2010	42	4	1077-1083	1077	1083							This study describes the prevalence and association of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection with blood-transmitted viral hepatitis including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). TTV infection was diagnosed by detection of TTV-DNA in serum, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TTV-DNA was estimated in a total number of one hundred patients with CRF and in 100 voluntary blood donors as controls. The markers of HBV and HCV were also tested in sera samples of these patients. TTV-DNA was detected in 39 of 100 patients (39%) with CRF and in 27 of 100 (27%) healthy controls. The analysis of the results demonstrated HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and HCV core antigen in 5.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 4.0% of patients, respectively. This study could not show any association of TTV with HBV and HCV infections for the transmission pattern or any impact on severity of diseases caused by these viruses in CRF patients. TTV also could not show any association with demographic characteristics of patients, duration of dialysis, number of blood transfusions and renal/liver function of the patients. As such, this study concludes that TTV appears as a benign pathogen, showing no sign of renal/liver damage or any change in the severity of diseases caused by blood-borne hepatitis viruses.														0301-1623	1573-2584	10.1007/s11255-009-9648-4																		J	BCI:BCI201100054858	20863859			Development of SYBR green-based real-time PCR and duplex nested PCR assays for quantitation and differential detection of species- or type-specific porcine Torque teno viruses		Huang, Y.

(xjmeng@vt.edu)									Journal of Virological Methods		2010	DEC 2010	170	1-2	140-146	140	146							Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV), a single-stranded circular DNA virus, has been incriminated in swine diseases recently. Multiple infection with porcine TTV species 1 (PTTV1) and species 2 (PTTV2), each consisting of two types (PTTV1a and 1b) or subtypes (PTTV2b and 2c), in a single pig had been reported by our group previously. The present study described three novel assays for quantitation and differential detection of porcine TTV. First, we developed two SYBR green-based real-time PCR assays to quantify viral loads of two porcine Try species, respectively. The PTTV1- and PTTV2-specific real-time PCR primer sequences were selected to target conserved regions identified by multiple alignments of ten available porcine TTV full-length genomes. Furthermore, by coupling the two singleplex PCR assays, a duplex real-time PCR assay followed by melting curve analysis was established for simultaneous detection and differentiation of PTTV1 and PTTV2. In addition, a type-specific duplex nested PCR was also developed to simultaneously detect and distinguish between the two types, PTTV1a and 1b, in PTTV1 species. These assays provide rapid and practical tools for molecular diagnosis of species- or type-specific porcine TTV. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Recently it has been suggested that swine torque teno viruses (TTVs), in co-infections with some swine viral pathogens, may potentiate the severity of disease. In order to search for virological cofactors associated with infectious hepatitis in pigs, we investigated the liver tissues, to determine the presence of TTVs, PCV2 and HEV of naturally infected pigs and analysed the prevalence of both genogroups of the TTVs in the hepatitis lesions. Histopathological techniques, nested-polymerase chain reactions (nPCRs), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and one-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were applied to detect hepatitis lesions, TTVs genogroups 1 and 2, PCV2 and HEV infection. Of the livers examined 58% (29/50) had mild to moderate hepatitis and 74% (37/50), 56% (28/50) and 26% (13/50) samples were nPCR, PCR and RT-PCR positive for TTVs PCV2 and HEV respectively. TTVs were detected in 84% (16/19) of the samples which were determined to be of mild severity while present in almost all (90% or 9/10) samples identified as having moderate hepatitis lesions. Additionally, the livers of 12 out of 21 (57%) pigs without the hepatitis lesions were positive for TTVs. These results demonstrate an association between TTVs and infectious hepatitis of pigs in concomitant infections with PCV2 and/or HEV and indicated that TTVs may play a role as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of disease.

In addition to bocavirus we demonstrated the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2 in these cases of PMWS, indicating the simultaneous presence of several viruses in this disease complex. In the present study, 34 PMWS-affected animals and 24 pigs without PMWS were screened by PCR for the presence of PCV-2, TTV-1, TTV-2 and porcine boca-like virus (Pbo-likeV). The studies revealed the following infection rates in the PMWS-affected pigs: PCV-2 100%, TTV-1 77%, TTV-2 94% and Pbo-likeV 88%. In comparison. the pigs without PMWS had the following rates: PCV-2 80%, TTV-1 79%, TTV-2 83% and Pbo-likeV 46%. The sequence identity between the different Swedish Pbo-likeV sequences ranged between 98% and 100%. By checking co-infection, it was found that 71% of the PMWS-affected pigs harbor simultaneously all these viruses. As a contrast, in the group without PMWS only 33% of the animals were positive simultaneously for these viruses. These observations indicate a multiple viral infection in PMWS-affected pigs. It has to be studied further if the clinical manifestation of PMWS might be due to synergistic effects of different viruses acting together. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Results obtained confirm that vertical transmission is an important route of TTVs dissemination In addition, data obtained suggest that swine TTVs should not be considered as infectious agents responsible for abortion occurrence (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved			Segales, Joaquim/AAB-4815-2020; Kekarainen, Tuija/M-1712-2014; Segales, Joaquim/A-4933-2011	Segales, Joaquim/0000-0002-1539-7261; Kekarainen, Tuija/0000-0002-0392-4706; Segales, Joaquim/0000-0002-1539-7261										0093-691X		10.1016/j.theriogenology.2010.02.011																		J	BCI:BCI201000435428	20031342			Porcine Torque teno virus: Determination of viral genomic loads by genogroup-specific multiplex rt-PCR, detection of frequent multiple infections with genogroups 1 or 2, and establishment of viral full-length sequences		Gallei, Andreas; Pesch, Stefan; Esking, Wiebke Schulze; Keller, Christoph; Ohlinger, Volker Fred (ohlinger@bioscreen-ms.de)									Veterinary Microbiology		2010	JUL 14 2010	143	2-4	202-212	202	212							Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. TTV is currently classified in the unassigned genus Anellovirus, and distinct TTVs of tentative species-status infect a wide range of vertebrates. In domestic pigs and wild boars, porcine TTV occurs in two genogroups, TTV1 and TTV2, which are currently detected using only conventional PCR assays. To allow high-throughput testing, the present study describes development of a multiplex real-time (rt)-PCR assay for efficient simultaneous detection of TTV1 and TTV2. To demonstrate usefulness of this rt-PCR assay for large-scale testing, 203 serum samples from domestic pigs were screened for TTV infection. The detected rates of single TTV1, single TTV2, and double TTV1/TTV2 infections were 32, 17, and 32% and represent the first report on the occurrence of porcine TTV in Germany. In addition, 100 wild boar lung samples were tested that confirmed high prevalences of TTV infection. Moreover, establishment of genogroup-specific rt-PCR standards allowed the determination of mean viral genomic loads in sera from TTV-infected swine to about 10(4.5)/ml, respectively. To verify the specificity of the rt-PCR assay, conventional PCR assays that amplify genogroup-specific, size-distinguishable products from the TTV untranslated regions were designed. In total, 50 clones derived from 24 PCR products obtained from 19 TTV1 and TTV2 single- or double-infected animals were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences demonstrated the frequent occurrence of multiple infections with distinct porcine TTVs of the same genogroup. Moreover, two porcine TTV full-length sequences were established, one for each genogroup. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

The patient underwent successful bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sister. Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA of genotype 1a and IgM-class antibody against the virus were detected in sera at the onset of hepatitis. TTV/1a DNA and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody levels were undetectable on the 16th and 46th days after the onset of illness, respectively. Anti-TTV/1a IgG antibody was positive throughout the observation period. Sequential viral load and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody suggested a primary infection of TTV/1a. Genomic sequence of the virus coincided with that of the original strain first isolated from human. TTV DNA was quantified at 130 copies in 10(5) bone marrow mononuclear cells, which suggested that infection of hematopoietic cells might be the cause of aplasia.

A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a TaqMan probe was developed to detect both genogroups of TTV strains.Methods and Results:Oligonucleotide primers and hybridization probes were designed based on sequence analysis of the noncoding region, a highly conserved part of the genome. The real-time PCR assay specifically detected bovine and porcine TTV DNA without cross-amplification of other common pathogens. The assay was compared with conventional PCR and nested-PCR assays for the detection of porcine genogroups 1 and 2 and bovine TTV on plasma and faecal samples, and the assay was found faster, more reliable and reduced the risk of false positive results.Conclusions:The real-time PCR assay provided better detection results for the two TTV genogroups in both swine and cattle compared to the conventional PCR assays.Significance and Impact of the Study:This new TaqMan PCR assay will be a useful tool for the detection of animal TTV strains, to evaluate the viral load from animal host and finally to identify the presence of these viruses in the agri-food continuum.														1364-5072	1365-2672	10.1111/j.1365-2672.2009.04624.x																		J	BCI:BCI201000404282	20338783			Testing for viral contaminants of veterinary vaccines in Hungary		Kulcsar, Gabor (kulcsarg@oai.hu) ; Farsang, Attila; Soos, T.									Biologicals		2010	MAY 2010	38	3	346-349	346	349							The safety of veterinary vaccines is of paramount importance and it is significantly jeopardised by extraneous agents such as bacteria, mycoplasma, Chlamydia and viruses. Several critical steps of vaccine manufacture involve a potential risk of viral contamination. Viruses, as extraneous, agents can be divided into two main groups. Group 1 agents, such as Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well-known to manufacturers and authorities. Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established to minimise the risk of contamination with these agents. Contrary to group 1, group 2 agents like Torque Teno virus (TTV) or RD114, a replication-competent feline gamma-retrovirus, have only recently been recognised and their role as contaminants needs further investigation.Randomly selected veterinary vaccines used between 1992 and 2009 were tested by nucleic acid amplification for CAV, EDSV, and ITV. Pestivirus contamination was examined in 33 vaccines used between 1996 and 2006 and a further 27 vaccines used between 2007 and 2009 based on random selection of these vaccines. In addition to random tests done on vaccines used from 2007 on, 12 batches of live Aujeszky's disease vaccines submitted to our laboratory for Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) were also tested for Pestivirus.

The information concerning the taxonomy of these viruses is presented. The virus strain of this group was demonstrated for the first time in 1997 in a human in Japan and was called TTV in reference to the initials of his name. Recently the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses has established a new meaning of TT, namely Torque teno virus, deriving from the Latin terms "torque" meaning "necklace" and "tennis" meaning "thin". These terms were chosen to reflect the shape of the TTV genome. TTV was classified to the Anellovirus genus of the Circoviridae family. It was stated that there is no evidence of a link between TTV infection of humans and specific diseases. The same was true in relation to infection of cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, cats and swine infected by other TTV strains, specific in its replication for a particular species of animals. The following text deals particularly with the last mentioned species. Globally TTV infection is widely spread in pigs. Animals, among them pigs, remain infected and even viremic for years without any apparent negative effects. However, in coinfection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), being the main etiological factor of PMWS, TTV may possibly contribute to the development of the clinical course of the disease. This is more evident in gnotobiotic pigs. In case of an infection exclusively with TTV in gnotobiotic pigs no clinical symptoms occur. However post mortem pathological changes including thymic atrophy, glomerulonephropathy and modest lymphocytic to histiocytic infiltrates in the liver are found. Summarizing, research concerning the role of TTV in the multifactorial etiology of disease syndromes needs to be continued.														0025-8628																				J	BCI:BCI201000234118	19969322			Real-time PCR detection of adenoviruses, polyomaviruses, and torque teno viruses in river water in Japan		Haramoto, Eiji (eharamoto@yamanashi.ac.jp) ; Kitajima, Masaaki; Katayama, Hiroyuki; Ohgaki, Shinichiro									Water Research		2010	MAR 2010	44	6	1747-1752	1747	1752							The prevalence of DNA viruses in water from the Tamagawa River, Japan was quantitatively surveyed for 6 months, from April to September 2003. A total of 18 river water samples were subjected to virus concentration method using an electronegative membrane, followed by DNA extraction and direct quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for DNA viruses. Adenoviruses of serotypes 40 and 41 were detected most frequently in the river water samples tested (61.1%), at a concentration ranging from 3.16 x 10(3) to 1.38 x 10(5) copies/l, followed by JC polyomaviruses (11.1%) and torque teno viruses (5.6%). No sample was positive for BK polyomaviruses. In addition, for selective detection of virus particles, adenoviruses 40 and 41 were tested with qPCR combined with an immunomagnetic separation technique; they were detected in only 16.7% of the samples, showing a concentration ranging from 7.42 x 10(2) to 4.24 x 10(4) copies/l. This study is significant since it is the first study to demonstrate the prevalence of polyomaviruses in water samples in Japan and to use immunomagnetic separation qPCR to detect adenovirus particles in aquatic environments.

We report here the identification of four distinct full-length genomic sequences of PTTV strains from a single pig in Virginia. Detailed analyses of the genomic organization, the degree of variability and the characteristics of conserved nucleotide and amino acid motifs of PTTV were conducted. The results showed that these four prototype U.S. strains of PTTV identified from the same pig represent distinct genotypes or subtypes and a revised classification system for PPTV is subsequently proposed. This is the first study documenting multiple PTTV infections with distinct genotypes OF subtypes in a single pig. The identification of novel PTTV strains from pigs in the United States also pave the way for future disease characterization and genotyping of PTTV. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The primary cause of this CNS disease remains elusive. Here we will address our current understanding of the role of viruses as potential environmental triggers for MS. Virus infections can act peripherally (outside the CNS) or within the CNS. The association of viral infections with demyelinating disease, in both animals and humans, will be discussed, as will the potential contributions of peripheral infection with Torque Teno virus, infection outside of and/or within the CNS with Epstein Barr virus and infection within the CNS with Human Herpesvirus 6 to MS. An experimental animal model, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible strains of mice is an example of viral infections of the CNS as a prerequisite for demyelination. Finally, the proposition that multiple virus infections are required, which first prime the immune system and then trigger the disease, as a model where infections outside of the CNS lead to inflammatory changes within the CNS, for the development of a MS-like disease is explored.														0080-1844(print)		10.1007/400_2008_12	978-3-642-14152-2(H)																	J	BCI:BCI201000023265	19923596			Short communication: Detection of human Torque teno virus in the milk of water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis)		Roperto, S.

Journal of Dairy Science		2009	DEC 2009	92	12	5928-5932	5928	5932							Forty-four raw milk and 15 serum samples from 44 healthy water buffaloes reared in Caserta, southern Italy, the most important region in Europe for buffalo breeding, were examined to evaluate the presence of Torque teno viruses (TTV) using molecular tools. Furthermore, 8 pooled pasteurized milk samples (from dairy factories having excellent sanitary conditions) and 6 Mozzarella cheese samples were also tested. Four of the cheese samples were commercial Mozzarella cheese; the remaining 2 were prepared with TTV-containing milk. Human TTV were detected and confirmed by sequencing in 7 samples of milk (approximately 16%). No TTV were found in serum, pooled pasteurized milk, or Mozzarella cheese samples. The samples of Mozzarella cheese prepared with TTV-containing milk did not show any presence of TTV, which provides evidence that standard methodological procedures to prepare Mozzarella cheese seem to affect viral structure, making this food fit for human consumption. The 7 TTV species from water buffaloes were identified as genotypes corresponding to the tth31 (3 cases), sle 1981, sle 2031, and NLC030 (2 cases each) human isolates. Although cross-species infection may occur, detection of TTV DNA in milk but not in serum led us to believe that its presence could be due to human contamination rather than a true infection. Finally, the mode of transmission of TTV has not been determined. Contaminated of the food chain with TTV may be a potential risk for human health, representing one of the multiple routes of infection.

However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we report that cloned DNA of a genogroup 4 TTV (ViPiSAL) is an activator of proinflammatory cytokine production by murine spleen cells and that the effect is mediated via toll-like receptor (TLR)9. The same DNA also increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines induced by two well-characterized TLR9 stimulants. Finally, in silico analyses of the genomes of ViPiSAL and other TTVs revealed marked differences in the representation of CpG motifs known to be most effective at activating immune cells via TLR9. These findings demonstrate for the first time that at least one TTV isolate has the potential to stimulate and co-stimulate inflammatory responses. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Veterinary Microbiology		2009	NOV 18 2009	139	3-4	213-218	213	218							Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus infecting human and non-primate species. Two genogroups of TTV (TTV1 and TTV2) have been described in swine so far. In the present study, TTV1 and TTV2 prevalences in serum, and nasal as well as rectal swabs of 55 randomly selected piglets from seven Spanish multi-site farms, were monitored from 1 to 15 weeks of age. Also, blood from their dams (n = 41) were taken at 1 week post-farrowing. Samples were tested by means of two TTV genogroup specific PCRs. Although prevalence of TTV1 and TTV2 in sows was relatively high (54% and 32%, respectively), it was not directly associated to their prevalence in the offspring. Percentage of viremic pigs for both TTV genogroups followed similar dynamics, increasing progressively over time, with the highest rate of detection at 11 weeks of age for TTV1 and at 15 weeks for TTV2. Forty-two (76%) and 33 (60%) of the 55 studied pigs were TTV1 and TTV2 PCR positive in serum, respectively, in more than one sampling time. TTV1 and TTV2 viremia lasted in a number of animals up to 15 and 8 weeks, respectively. Co-infection with both TTV genogroups in serum was detected at all sampling points, but at 1 week of age. On the contrary, there were animals PCR negative to both genogroups in serum at all sampling times but at 15 weeks of age. During the study period, TTV1 and TTV2 nasal shedding increased also over time and faecal excretion was intermittent and of low percentage (<20%). In conclusion, the present study describes for the first time the infection dynamics of TTV1 and TTV2 as well as the nasal and faecal excretion throughout the life of pigs from conventional, multi-site farms. Moreover, results indicate that both swine TTV genogroups are able to establish persistent infections in a number of pigs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TTV was also identified in several animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, cats and dogs. In this study, we analysed the prevalence of swine TTV genogroups 1 (TTV1) and 2 (TTV2) in Japanese swine populations with suspected post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and porcine respiratory disease by using a nested polymerase chain reaction method. Of 153 serum samples from 16 different herds in Japan, TTVI was detected in 46 samples (30%), TTV2 in 47 samples (31%) and both in 15 samples (10%). There was no significant difference in the detection rate among geographical regions. The overall prevalence rate of TTV genogroups was significantly lower in <= 30-day-old pigs (11%) compared to that in older age groups (54-82%). These results suggest that swine TTV may be widespread in post-weaning pigs and could play aetiological roles in pig diseases in Japan.

The overall host-specificity of the HS-HF183 marker to differentiate between humans and other animals was 98%. However, the HS-esp, HS-AVs and HS-PVs showed 100% host-specificity. All the human-specific markers showed >97% sensitivity to detect human fecal pollution. E. coli, enterococci and, C. perfringens were detected up to dilutions of sewage 10(-5), 10(-4) and 10(-3) respectively. HS-esp, HS-AVs, HS-PVs, SVs and TVs were detected up to dilution of sewage 10-4 whilst EVs were detected up to dilution 10-5. The ability of the HS-HF183 marker to detect fresh sewage was 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the HS-esp and viral markers. The ability to detect fresh sewage in freshwater, seawater and distilled water matrices was similar for human-specific bacterial and viral marker. Based on our data, it appears that human-specific molecular markers are sensitive measures of fresh sewage pollution, and the HS-HF183 marker appears to be the most sensitive among these markers in terms of detecting fresh sewage. However, the presence of the HS-HF183 marker in environmental waters may not necessarily indicate the presence of enteric viruses due to their high abundance in sewage compared to enteric viruses. More research is required on the persistency of these markers in environmental water samples in relation to traditional fecal indicators and enteric pathogens. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Seven patients showed a 1-5 log TTV load decrease during HAART, while the others did not show significant variations. A decrease in the number of coinfecting TTV genogroups was detected in 12 of 15 patients, with the mean number of TTV genogroups/patient decreasing from 2.33 before HAART to 1.47 at the last collect. All five genogroups were less frequently found after introduction of HAART. Three hundred sixty-seven TTV clones from four different genogroups, derived from two patients, were sequenced. Noticeable fluctuations in TTV subpopulation frequencies were observed in both patients analyzed. In conclusion, HAART tends to reduce the number of TTV genotypes/genogroups and may affect the balance between different TTV isolates coinfecting single individuals.

The aim of this study was to examine HBV, HCV, HDV, and TTV infections in Saudi drug users (N = 344). Extraction of nucleic acid from serum, reverse-transcription, amplification of viral nucleic acids, and HBV and HCV genotyping were done using established techniques. Of the analyzed samples, 41 (12%) contained detectable HBV DNA, 131 (38%) contained detectable HCV RNA, and 174 (51%) had detectable TTV DNA. The predominant HBV genotype was found to be genotype D and the predominant HCV genotype was found to be genotype 1b. All the samples were negative for HDV. Twelve samples (3.5%) were found to contain mixed HBV and HCV genomes, 24 samples (7%) were found to contain mixed HBV and TTV genomes, 82 samples (24%) were found to contain mixed HCV and TTV genomes, and 9 samples (2.6%) were found to contain mixed HBV, HCV, and TTV genomes. Identification of various infections in drug users will help the control of these infections in this group as well as in the community. J. Med. Viral. 81:1343-1347,2009. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

In addition to TTV isolates, TTV genogroup 3 also includes the 8 virus strains known as SENV-A to H. In this study, the prevalence of TTV group 3 viruses and that of SENV-D and H in particular were determined among the staff of a hospital in Budapest. Viruses were genotyped using type-specific PCR primers and by cloning and sequencing of PCR products. Frequency of infection with TTV group 3 was high among both the hospital staff and the control group. Prevalence of SENV-H was similar in the two groups, but SENV-D infection was significantly more common in the study group than in controls. Sequencing of PCR products showed that viruses closely related to isolate TUS01 are common in Hungary. Several sequences could not be genotyped and may represent a previously undescribed genotype within the genogroup. TTV group 3 sequences detected in the serum samples of a symptomless health care worker were followed-up for 15 years. Some strains persisted for up to 10 years, while others caused transient infections and could be detected in only one of the samples. Results showed that TTV infection, superinfection, and viral clearance often occur over the years without apparent symptoms.														0920-8569	1572-994X	10.1007/s11262-009-0369-7																		J	BCI:BCI200900499763				Changes In CD8+57+ T lymphocyte Expansions After Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation Correlate With Changes in Torquetenovirus Viremia (vol 85, pg 1867, 2008)		Maggi, Fabrizio; Ricci, Valentina; Bendinelli, Mauro; Nelli, Luca Ceccherini; Focosi, Daniele; Papineschi, Federico; Petrini, Mario; Paumgardhen, Elena; Ghimenti, Massimo									Transplantation (Hagerstown)		2009	JUL 27 2009	88	2	293	293												Maggi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-7489-5271										0041-1337	1534-6080																			J	BCI:BCI200900428086	19201112			Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in sows and suckling piglets		Sibila, M.

Veterinary Microbiology		2009	JUN 12 2009	137	3-4	354-358	354	358							Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that has been detected in serum of primate and non-primate species including swine. Little information on swine TTV infection and transmission dynamics is nowadays available. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the potential role of the sow in transmitting TTV to piglets and the infection dynamics of both swine TTV genogroups (TTV1 and TTV2) during the lactation period. Serum samples from 44 sows at I-week post-farrowing and 215 piglets at I and 3 weeks of age were tested using TTV1 and TTV2 PCR methods. Sow parity distribution and the number of delivered piglets (liveborn, stillborn and mummified) per each studied sow were recorded. TTV1 was detected in higher percentages than TTV2 in both sows (75% vs. 43%, respectively) and piglets at 1 (17% vs. 7%, respectively) and 3 (32% vs. 12%, respectively) weeks of age. TTV1 and TTV2 co-infections were observed in higher percentages in sows (34%) than in piglets (2% and 4% at I and 3 weeks of age, respectively). Detection of swine TTV genogroups in sows was not associated with their detection in piglets. Moreover, there were piglets infected at 1 week of age with a swine TTV genogroup different from the one detected in their dam. The number of sows delivering stillborns and the mean number of stillborns per sow tended to be higher in the TTV2 infected sows; this value was significantly higher when co-infected sows (TTV1 and TTV2) were compared with non-co-infected ones. Old parity sows had a higher percentage of TTV1 infected 1 week-old piglets. Results of the present study showed that the TTV infection occurs early in the production system and that these viruses may be transmitted from sow-to-piglet but also from piglet-to-piglet in farrowing facilities.

Food and Environmental Virology		2009	JUN 2009	1	2	85-91	85	91							The discharge of treated civil wastewater into natural waters or their reuse in industry and agriculture involves virological risks for the exposed population. Although European and Italian regulations do not require routine viral analysis of treated wastewater, a better understanding of viral contamination and resistance to treatments is needed to assess and control such risks. To this end, a wastewater treatment plant was monitored by analysing the sewage at the plant entry and exit points in order to quantify the initial presence and eventual reduction of adenovirus, Torque Teno virus, Hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, enterovirus, norovirus genogroups I and II, somatic coliphages, Escherichia coli and enterococci. The results reveal that treated water may still contain infectious human viruses and thereby represent a potential health hazard. No significant correlations were found between bacterial indicators and the viruses considered, confirming their inadequacy for virological risk assessment, while the best indicators for virus inactivation in recycled waters seem to be adenovirus, followed by somatic coliphages.

Theriogenology		2009	JUN 2009	71	9	1390-1395	1390	1395							Routes of swine torque teno virus (TTV) transmission have been minimally investigated in the pig population. Current knowledge suggests the faecal-oral route as the most probable way of viral dissemination. Other transmission routes, such as mother-to-infant, have been studied in humans, but no information is available for swine. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of two swine TTV genogroups, TTV1 and TTV2, in colostrum samples (n = 61) and sera samples front sows (n = 10) and stillborn pigs coming from them (n = 30). Colostrum was fractioned into two components, milk whey and cell pellets, and 26 out of 61 milk whey samples and 30 out of 58 cell pellets analyzed contained TTV1 or TTV2 genomes, respectively, detected by specific PCR methods. Six and 3 out of 10 serum samples from sows were positive for TTV1 and TTV2 DNA, respectively. Finally, 15 out of 30 sera from stillborns were PCR positive for TTV 1, but only 2 were TTV2 positive. Positive stillborns were always infected with the same TTV genogroup as their mothers. However, TTV sequence analysis determined that sequences obtained front sows and their stillborns were not identical. In conclusion, our results indicated that swine TTVs can be transmitted vertically, and suggest that different sow-to-piglet transmission routes may coexist, including transplacental/intra-uterine as well as through lactation. This study represents the first description of swine TTV presence in colostrum and stillborn piglets. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Transplantation Proceedings		2009	MAY 2009	41	4	1378-1379	1378	1379							Torque Teno Virus (TTV), a nonenveloped human virus of the Circoviridae family, is hepatotropic, causing liver damage, cirrhosis, and, rarely, fulminant hepatitis. It prevails in 10% to 75% of blood donors due to environmental differences, independent of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HCV hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and in fulminant hepatitis non-A-G. Reports about the efficacy of clinical alpha interferon are rare. In July 2007, a 65-year-old man who was serologically negative for A-E viruses presented with acute liver failure due to a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm and under-went orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Immunosuppression was based on cyclosporine and steroids. At postoperative day 20, there was persistent hypertransaminasemia with otherwise normal liver function. A percutaneous hepatic biopsy documented pattern suggestive of a viral etiology. Multiple tests for hepatotropic viruses in the donor and the recipient from the pre- and post-OLT periods remained negative. Only the TTV qualitative test, assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient sera, was positive. Immunosuppressive therapy was not changed; no antiviral therapy was undertaken. At 6 months posttransplantation, transaminase levels spontaneously normalized and the clinical situation was unchanged. No complications were observed; the patient is in good clinical condition. No graft rejection was observed. In histologically proven non-A-E viral hepatitis, it is important to consider TTV as an incidental pathogenic agent. It may be useful to extend virological tests to TTV among transplant recipients and donors and to gain further knowledge about this virus.

Although viruses of this type have quite a stable genome, they exhibit low nucleotide homology. Torque teno virus infection has not been consistently linked to specific diseases, although there is epidemiological evidence of an association with disease in humans. The recent recognition of naturally occurring TTV infection in swine and its epidemiological resemblance to human TTV raises the possibility of using the pie as a model to Study human TTV infection. Such an approach will require the development of novel investigative tools to study the epidemiology, transmission, immune responses and potential pathogenesis of TTV infection.

Also, the molecular evolution of TTV genogroups I and 2 during the 20-year period studied using a 250-base sequence of the non-coding region of the viral genome was assessed. Both TTV genogroup genomes were found in pig sera from the first year of study. Taking into account the whole study period, 113 out of 162 animals (69.8%) were infected with one or the other genogroup, while 38 out of 162 pigs (23.5%) were co-infected with both genogroups. Moreover, TTV genogroup 2 (90 out of 162, 55.6%) was significantly more prevalent than genogroup 1 (54 out of 162, 33.3%). The non-coding region of swine TTV genome sequenced showed its adequacy as a molecular marker in swine TTV.

Two genetically distinct TTV genogroups (TTV1 and TTV2) infect swine worldwide with high prevalence. Currently, swine TTVs are considered non-pathogenic, although TTV2 has been linked to post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, a porcine circovirus disease. On the other hand, pig materials are an important source of components used in porcine vaccine manufacturing, human drugs and commercial enzyme products. However, there is little information about the possible existence of extraneous viruses in products containing porcine-derived components. In the present study, 26 commercial swine vaccines, seven human drugs and three enzyme products from porcine origin were tested for the presence of TTV1 and TTV2 genomes by PCR. Four vaccines against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae were positive for TTV2 by PCR. Three M. hyopneumoniae, one porcine parvovirus and one porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccines were PCR positive for TTV1. One human drug contained TTV1 DNA as well as a trypsin enzyme; a porcine-derived elastase product was positive for both TTV genogroups. These results show that swine TTVs are contaminants not only of swine vaccines but also of human drugs containing porcine components and enzymes for laboratory use.

DNA replication was completely abolished in cells transfected with replicative form of CAV/Ap(-). A reverse mutant competent in apoptin production regained the full level of DNA replication. DNA replication and virus-like particle (VLP) production of CAV/Ap(-) was fully complemented by supplementation of the wild type apoptin. The virus yield of a point mutant, CAV/ApT(108)I, was 1/40 that of the wild type, even though its DNA replication level was full. The infectious titer of CAV was fully complemented by supplementing apoptin. Progeny virus was free from reverse mutation for (TI)-I-108. To localize the domain within apoptin molecule inevitable for CAV replication, apoptinmutant expressing plasmids, pAp1, pAp2, pAp3, and pAp4, were constructed by deleting amino acids 1036,31-59, 59-88 and 80-112, respectively. While Ap1 and Ap2 were preferentially localized in nuclei, Ap3 and Ap4 were mainly present in cytoplasm. Although complementation capacity of Ap3 and Ap4 was 1/10 of the wild type, neither of them completely lost its activity. VP3 of TTV did fully complement the DNA replication and VLP of CAV/Ap(-). These data suggest that apoptin is inevitable not only for DNA replication but also VLP of CAV. The common feature of apoptin and TTV-VP3 presented another evidence for close relatedness of CAV and TTV. (c) 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Unexpectedly, human TTMDV DNA was not detectable in any of 74 chimpanzees tested, although all but one tested positive for both human TTV and TTMV DNA. Using universal primers for anelloviruses, novel variants of TTMDV that are phylogenetically clearly separate from human TTMDV were identified from chimpanzees, and over the entire genome, three chimpanzee TTMDV variants differed by 17.9-20.3 % from each other and by 40.4-43.6 % from all 18 reported human TTMDVs. A newly developed PCR assay that uses chimpanzee TTMDV-specific primers revealed the high prevalence of chimpanzee TTMDV in chimpanzees (63/74, 85%) but low prevalence in humans (1/100). While variants of TTV and TTMV from chimpanzees and humans were phylogenetically interspersed, those of TTMDV were monophyletic for each species, with sequence diversity of <33 and <20 % within the 18 human and three chimpanzee TTMDV variants, respectively. Maximum within-group divergence values for TTV and TTMV were 51 and 57 %, respectively; both of these values were substantially greater than the maximum divergence among TTMDV variants (44 %), consistent with a later evolutionary emergence of TTMDV. However, substantiation of this hypothesis will require further analysis of genetic diversity using an expanded dataset of TTMDV variants in humans and chimpanzees. Similarly, the underlying mechanism of observed infrequent cross-species infection of TTMDV between humans and chimpanzees deserves further analysis.

As suspected in the earlier stages of their description, a considerable genetic variability characterizes TTV and related viruses, the current members of the floating genus Anellovirous. Since information related to anelloviruses diversity is in constant evolution, the challenge in their taxonomic classification is to take into account all pertinent parameters, along with the taxonomic situation of other viruses having circular single-stranded DNA genomes. Past, present and future phylogenetic and taxonomic considerations are exposed.

Using highly conserved primers derived from the untranslated region of the human TTV genome, a variety of TTV-like viruses have been found circulating in nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees, macaques, and tamarins. TTV variants in nonhuman primates are species-specific, although some genetic groups of human and chimpanzee TTVs cluster to make human/chimpanzee clades. TTVs from macaques and tamarins are increasingly divergent from TTV variants infecting humans and chimpanzees. TTV-Iike mini virus (TTMV) infections have also been detected in chimpanzees, with genotypes distinct but interspersed with human TTMV genotypes. Pets are also naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and several isolates have been found in cats and dogs. In addition, other mammals such as tupaias and pigs have species-specific TTVs: swine TTVs are found among pigs worldwide. The genomic organization and proposed transcriptional profiles of TTVs infecting nonhuman primate and other mammalian species are similar to those of human TTVs, and co-evolution of TTVs with their hosts has been suggested. To date, TTVs infecting nonhuman primates and other mammalian species have been under-examined. It is likely that essentially all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs.

These three anelloviruses frequently and ubiquitously infect humans, and the infections are characterized by lifelong viremia and great genetic variability. Although TTV infection has been epidemiologically suggested to be associated with many diseases including liver diseases, respiratory disorders, hematological disorders, and cancer, there is no direct causal evidence for links between TTV infection and specific clinical diseases. The pathogenetic role of TTMV and TTMDV infections remains unknown. The changing ratio of the three anelloviruses to each other over time, relative viral load, or combination of different genotype(s) of each anellovirus may be associated with the pathogenicity or the disease-inducing potential of these three human anelloviruses. To clarify their disease association, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems for accurately detecting, differentiating, and quantitating all of the genotypes and/or genogroups of TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV should be established and standardized, as should methods to detect past infections and immunological responses to anellovirus infections.

The immunobiology of the AVs is no exception. However, evidence is progressively accumulating that at least some AVs have an interesting interplay with cells and soluble factors known to contribute to the homeostasis of innate and adaptive immunity. Evidence is also accumulating that this interplay can have a significant impact on how effectively an infected host can deal with superimposed infectious and non-infectious noxae. This review article discusses the scanty information available on these aspects and highlights the ones that would be more urgent to precisely understand in order to get an adequate assessment of how important for human health these extremely ubiquitous and pervasive viruses really are.			maggi, fabrizio/L-2974-2013	Maggi, Fabrizio/0000-0001-7489-5271										0070-217X(print)			978-3-540-70971-8(H)																	S	BCI:BCI200900103944	19230559			Intragenomic Rearrangement in TT Viruses: A Possible Role in the Pathogenesis of Disease		de Villiers, E. -M.

In vivo and in vitro intragenomic rearrangement of TT virus genomes has been demonstrated. Replication in cell culture of a subviral molecule (411 bp) occurs through oligomerisation of RNA transcripts. Although the functions of the respective TT viral genes, as well as the newly formed genes in the rearranged subviral molecules, are largely unknown, certain similarities to genes of plant viruses of the family Geminiviridae will be described. A degree of similarity to certain cellular genes poses the question as to a role of molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and diabetes.

Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with every one of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. This structure is distinct from those of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36-nt stretch near the replication origin of TA278 TTV possesses more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions does not exhibit a significant similarity. Nevertheless, the relative allocation of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNA (m-RNAs) are generated by transcription in both of them. The structural protein with the replicase domain is coded for by frame I in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is coded for by frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is necessary for the replication of CAV. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. Considering these similarities and dissimilarities between CAV and TTV, it seems more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of genus Gyrovirus, into Anelloviridae together with TTV, or into a new independent family.

CAV encodes the protein apoptin that specifically induces apoptosis in (human) tumor cells. Functional studies reveal that apoptin induces apoptosis in a very broad range of (human) tumor cells. A putative TTV open reading frame (ORF) in TTV genotype 1, named TTV apoptosis inducing protein (TAIP), it induces, like apoptin, p53-independent apoptosis in various human hepatocarcinoma cell lines to a similar level as apoptin. In comparison to apoptin, TAIP action is less pronounced in several analyzed human non-hepatocarcinoma-derived cell lines. Detailed sequence analysis has revealed that the TAIP ORF is conserved within a limited group of the heterogeneous TTV population. However, its N-terminal half, N-TAIP, is rather well conserved in a much broader set of TTV isolates. The similarities between apoptin and TAIP, and their relevance for the development and treatment of diseases is discussed.														0070-217X(print)			978-3-540-70971-8(H)																	S	BCI:BCI200900103948	19230563			Chicken Anemia Virus		Schat, K.

CAV shares some similarities with Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) such as coding for a protein inducing apoptosis and a protein with a dual-specificity phosphatase. In contrast to TTV, the genome of CAV is highly conserved. Another important difference is that CAV can be isolated in cell culture. CAV produces a single elements. Transcription is enhanced by estrogen and repressed by at least two other transcription factors, one of which is COUP-TF1. A remarkable feature of CAV is that the virus can remain latent in gonadal tissues in the presence or absence of virus-neutralizing antibodies. In contrast to TTV, CAV can cause clinical disease and subclinical immunosuppression especially affecting CD8(+) T lymphocytes. Clinical disease is associated with infection in newly hatched chicks lacking maternal antibodies or older chickens with a compromised humoral immune response.														0070-217X(print)			978-3-540-70971-8(H)																	S	BCI:BCI200900103950				TT Viruses - The Still Elusive Human Pathogens					De Villiers, EM; ZurHausen, H						TT Viruses - The Still Elusive Human Pathogens	Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology	2009		331											This 228-page book presents and describes TT Viruses-The Still Elusive Human Pathogens, in which it reviews an overview of recent progress in the understanding of magnetic properties in nanoscale through recent results of various theoretical and experimental investigations.

Groups of 3-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with pooled plasma samples obtained from healthy feeder pigs in a herd that was in the initial phases of an outbreak of respiratory disease; gross and histologic lesions of PDNS were detected in the inoculated pigs. In a second experiment, 2- and 3-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and with PRRSV-negative tissue homogenate containing genogroup 1 torque teno virus (g1-TTV). Lesions of PDNS were detected.Results-Pigs inoculated with pooled plasma or the combination of tissue-culture-origin PRRSV and g1-TTV tissue homogenate developed systemic hemostatic defects, bilaterally symmetric cutaneous hemorrhages, generalized edema, icterus, bilaterally symmetric renal cortical hemorrhage, dermal vasculitis with hemorrhage, and interstitial pneumonia consistent with a clinical and pathologic diagnosis of PDNS. The PRRSV RNAs and g1-TTV DNAs were detected in plasma; all pigs seroconverted to PRRSV, and all had negative results for porcine circovirus type 2 when tested by use of PCR assays.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-These data suggested that PDNS is a manifestation of disseminated intravascular coagulation in swine. For the. experimental conditions reported here, combined infection with g1-TTV and PRRSV was implicated in the genesis of these lesions.

Bone marrow-liver homogenates that had positive results for torque teno virus (TTV) were used in 4 serial passages in gnotobiotic pigs (2 pigs/passage). A pathogenesis experiment was conducted with in vivo passages of g1-TTV in various groups of gnotobiotic pigs.Results-All g1-TTV inoculated pigs had no clinical signs but developed interstitial pneumonia, transient thymic atrophy, membranous glomerulonephropathy, and modest lymphocytic to histiocytic infiltrates in the liver after inoculation with the TTV-containing tissue homogenate; these changes were not detected in uninoculated control pigs or pigs injected with tissue homogenate devoid of TTV DNAs. In situ hybridization was used to identify g1-TTV DNAs in bone marrow mononuclear cells.Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-Analysis of these data revealed that porcine g1-TTV was readily transmitted to TTV-naive swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with g1-TTV. Thus, g1-TTV could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious agent of swine. This indicated a directly associated induction of lesions attributable to TTV infection in swine for a virus of the genus Anellovirus.

TTV ssDNA genomes have a size of 3.6 to 3.8 kb and display up to 30% nucleotide diversity, The pathogenic potential Of TTV is Under investigation. To address a putative link of pathogenicity with the observed sequence variations, the transcription profile of P/1C1 (genogroup 1) isolated from a patient diseased with a non A-G hepatitis was analysed. Four mRNAs were identified, which encoded the seven proteins ORFI, ORF1/1, ORF1/2, ORF2, ORF2/2, ORF3 and ORF4. Expression of the ORF1 protein and its splice variant ORF1/1 in cell culture was detected by an ORF1-specific antiserum. Analysis of N-terminal tagged P/1C1-encoded proteins revealed that ORF1 ORF1/1 and ORF1/2 were localised in the nucleoli, ORF3 and ORF4 resided in the nucleoplasm, ORF2/2 appeared either in the nucleoli Or the whole nucleus while ORF2 was the only protein seen in the cytoplasm.

(Lester.Shulman@sheba.health.gov.il)									Virus Research		2008	OCT 2008	137	1	1-15	1	15							Current clinical Studies on human annelloviruses infections are directed towards finding an associated disease. In this review we have emphasized the many similarities between human anellovirus and avian circoviruses and the cell and tissue types infected by these pathogens. We have done this in Order to explore whether knowledge acquired from natural and experimental avian infections could reflect and be extrapolated to the less well-characterized human annellovirus infections. The knowledge gained from the avian system may provide suggestions for decoding the enigmatic human anellovirus infections, and finding the specific disease or diseases caused by these human anellovirus infections. Each additional parallelism between chicken anemia virus (CAV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) further strengthens this premise. As we have seen information from human infections can also be used to better understand avian infections as well. Increased attention must be focused on the "hidden" or unrecognized, seemingly asymptomatic effects of circovirus and anellovirus infections. Understanding the facilitating effectof these infections on disease progression caused by other pathogens may help to explain differences in outcorne of complicated poultry and human diseases. The final Course of a pathogenic infection is determined by variations in the state of health of the host before, during and after contact with a pathogen, in addition to the phenotype of the pathogen and host.The health burden of circoviridae and anellovirus infections may be underestimated, due to lack of awareness of the need to search past the predominant clinical effect of identified pathogens and look for modulation of cellular-based immunity caused by co-infecting circoviruses, and by analogy, human anneloviruses.

The occurrence of TTV was evaluated in the streams crossing the city of Manaus (Brazilian Amazon) over a 1-year period, four times a year.Methods and Results: Fifty-two water samples were collected from 13 different locations. Viruses were concentrated from two litres of water by adsorption to negative membrane filters followed by ultrafiltration. TTV DNA was detected by PCR assays designed to detect all five TTV genomic groups. By conventional PCR, 19/52 (37%) samples were positive. By real-time PCR, TTV DNA could be detected in 48/52 (92%) samples. Viral loads ranged from 1300 to 746 000 genome equivalent per 100 ml of river water. Eleven distinct nucleotide sequences were obtained.Conclusions: Our results show the wide distribution and diversity of TTV among Manaus urban micro basins.Significance and Impact of the Study: The data presented here may contribute to substantiate TTV as a sensitive indicator of human contamination.

Journal of Medical Virology		2008	FEB 2008	80	2	365-371	365	371							As a consequence of the high prevalence of TorqueTeno virus (TTV) in blood donors, thalassemia patients frequently acquire various genotypes of this virus through therapeutic blood transfusions. At present, the clinical consequences of TTV infection remain indeterminate for these patients. Here, several hundred thalassemia patients were tested for the presence of TTV and its genotypes using a combination of PCR and clone-based DNA sequencing. Approximately 10% (12/118) of the patients aged 220 years remained negative for TTV including eight genotypes of SENV. Ferritin, aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) and alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) levels were invariably lower in TTV-negative patients (P=0.02, <0.01, and 0.06, respectively) than in TTV-positive patients. Patients with TTV-HCV co-infection showed elevated ferritin and ALT levels compared with patients with TTV infection alone (P<0.02 and P<0.01). AST and ALT levels were within the normal range for all TTV-negative patients, whereas abnormal levels of AST and ALT were seen in a significant proportion of TTV-positive patients (30.7% and 33.6%, respectively) and patients with TTV-HCV co-infections (70.0% and 56.6%, respectively). Only TTV-positive patients (28.0%) and patients with TTV-HCV co-infections (36.3%) had hyper-ferritin levels (>= 3,000 ng/ml). The genotype(s) of TTV responsible for the liver dysfunction could not be determined. However, high levels of AST and ALT were found to be correlated with detection of a higher number of TTV genotypes in the patients. The data suggests that frequent and persistent TTV infection through blood transfusion is associated with hepatic dysfunction and/or damage in transfusion dependent thalassemia patients.														0146-6615		10.1002/jmv.21070																		J	BCI:BCI200900193470				Study of Torque Teno Virus Natural Dissemination in a Swine Herd		Gagne, M-J.; Leblanc, D.; Houde, A.; Brassard, J.

Very little is known about presence of TTV in Canadian livestock and the goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of TTV in swine and cattle using molecular tools. TTV DNA was detected and confirmed by sequencing in the plasma of 90.5% and in the feces of 60.3% of the animals tested in a single swine herd as well as 80.9% and 1.1% in the plasma of individuals from general Quebec swine and cattle populations, respectively. The impact of the TTV presence in livestock population for the agri-food chain should be further investigated. Crown Copyright (C) 2007 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The function of the TTV open reading frame (ORF) in the nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathway has not yet been established. In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-kappa B activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-kappa B pathway. By Western blot analysis, we proved that the M ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-kappa B expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition Of I kappa B alpha protein degradation. Further immunoprecipitation assays showed that the TTV ORF2 protein could physically interact with IKK beta as well as IKK alpha, but not IKK gamma. Luciferase assays and Western blot experiments showed that the TTV ORF2 protein could also suppress NF-kappa B activity in the noncanonical NF-kappa B pathway and block the activation and translocation of p52. Finally, we found that the TTV ORF2 protein inhibited the transcription of NF-kappa B-mediated downstream genes (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, and COX-2) through down-regulation of NF-kappa B. Together, these data indicate that the TTV ORF2 protein suppresses the canonical and noncanonical NF-kappa B pathways, suggesting that the TTV ORF2 protein may be involved in regulating the innate and adaptive immunity of organisms, contributing to TTV pathogenesis, and even be related to some diseases.			li, baozong/K-4176-2012											0022-538X	1098-5514	10.1128/JVI.01101-07																		J	BCI:BCI200800031319	17767950			Detection of swine Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2 in boar sera and semen		Kekarainen, T.

Theriogenology		2007	OCT 15 2007	68	7	966-971	966	971							Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA virus infecting swine and several other species. TTV is nowadays considered a non-pathogenic virus in all species where it has been found. In the present study, the prevalence of two distinct swine TTV genogroups in boar semen and sera was determined by a nested PCR method. Furthermore, association between TTV infection and semen qualitative and quantitative parameters was analyzed. TTV was detected in 74% of boar sera and 72% in semen. The prevalence of genogroup 1 in sera and semen were 64% and 55%, respectively, while lower prevalence of genogroup 2 was observed in both sera (38%) and semen (32%). Some significant associations of TTV infection on semen characteristics in boar genetic lines were observed, but qualitative and quantitative semen parameters obtained in studied boars fall into normal expected ranges. Therefore, TTV semen infection was not evidenced to be harmful for the studied qualitative and quantitative parameters of semen. The high rate of TTV in semen suggests that sexual route might contribute to the transmission of the virus. It is presently unknown if this potential vertical transmission of swine TTV implies any effect on female reproductive tract. This study also represents the first description of swine TTV presence in semen. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

(hokamoto@jichi.ac.jp)									Archives of Virology		2007	OCT 2007	152	11	1961-1975	1961	1975							Recently, we identified a novel human virus with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, tentatively designated as torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a genomic organization resembling those of torque teno virus (TTV) of 3.8-3.9 kb and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) of 2.8-2.9 kb. To investigate the extent of genomic variability of TTMDV genomes, the full-length sequence was determined for 15 TTMDV isolates obtained from viremic individuals in Japan. The 15 TTMDV isolates comprised 3175-3230 bases and shared 67.0-90.3% identities with each other, and were only 68.4-73.0% identical to the 3 reported TTMDV isolates over the entire genome. TTMDV possessed a genomic organization with four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) with characteristic sequence motifs and stem and loop structures with high GC content, similar to TTV and TTMV. The total of 18 TTMDV genomes differed by up to 60.7% from each other in the amino acid sequence of ORF1 (658-677 amino acids), but segregated phylogenetically into the same cluster, which was distantly related to the TTVs and TTMVs. These results indicate that TTMDV with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, has an extremely high degree of genomic variability, and is classifiable into a third group in the genus Anellovirus.

This approach permitted the characterization of nine anelloviruses. Most of them were identified as highly divergent strains that were classified into species of the genus Anellovirus. The smallest anellovirus described so far in humans was characterized (2PoSMA, 2002 nt; 'small anellovirus' species). Two highly divergent sequences belonging to the species Torque Teno Mini Virus (LIL-y1, 2887 nt; LIL-y2, 2871 nt), which clustered into a new phylogenetic branch, were also identified in human plasma samples. Finally, two genomes that are separated by a genetic divergence of 46% were characterized in the cat's saliva, one of these creating a distinct phylogenetic branch (PRA1, 2019 nt). These results highlight the potential of RCA-SISPA for detecting circular (or circularized) genomes.

TTV resembles in genome organization the chicken anemia virus, the animal pathogen of the Circoviridae family, and is currently classified as a member of a new, floating genus, Anellovirus. Molecular and cell biological research on TTV has been restricted by the lack of permissive cell lines and functional, replication-competent plasmid clones. In order to examine the key biological activities (i.e. RNA transcription and DNA replication) of this still poorly characterized ssDNA virus, we cloned the full-length genome of TTV genotype 6 and transfected it into cells of several types. TTV mRNA transcription was detected by RT-PCR in all the cell types: KU812Ep6, Cos-1, 293, 293T, Chang liver, Huh7 and UT7/Epo-S1. Replicating TTV DNA was detected in the latter five cell types by a DpnI-based restriction enzyme method coupled with Southern analysis, a novel approach to assess TTV DNA replication. The replicating full-length clone, the cell lines found to support TTV replication, and the methods presented here will facilitate the elucidation of the molecular biology and the life cycle of this recently identified human virus.

Analyses of the transcription patterns of tth8 and tth7 TT virus isolates in a number of lymphoma and T-cell leukemia cell lines indicated differential additional splicing events and intragenomic rearrangement generating open reading frames which could not be deducted from the genomic sequence. We also demonstrated the presence of rearranged TT virus genomes in vivo in sera taken from pregnant mothers whose children later developed childhood leukemia, as well as sera from control mothers. Control experiments using religated cloned genomic tth8 DNA mixed with cellular DNA did not result in such subviral molecules. These subviral isolates ranged from 172 bp to full-length TT virus genomes. Possible in vivo selection for specific rearranged molecules was indicated by the presence of one isolate (561 bp) in 11 serum samples. It remains to be clarified whether selected rearranged subviral components resulting from specific Tr virus types may contribute to the initiation of disease. These data demonstrate new features of Tr viruses suggesting possible similarities to plant viruses of the family Geminiviridae, as well as raise questions about the documented plurality and diversity of anelloviruses.

The entire genomic sequence of three isolates (MD1-032, MD1-073 and MD2-013), which comprised 3242-3253 bases, and exhibited 76-99% identities with the SAVs within the overlapping sequence, was determined. Although the MD1-032, MD1-073 and MD2-013 isolates differed by 10-28 % from each other over the entire genome, they segregated into the same cluster and were phylogenetically distinguishable from all reported TTVs and TTMVs. These results suggest that SAVs are deletion mutants of the novel virus with intermediate genomic length between those of TTV and TTMV and that the novel virus can be classified into a third group of the genus Anellovirus.

However, the genetic relationship between human and animal TTV remains uncertain. In this study, genotypic characterization of TTV in different Camel specimens from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was undertaken for comparison with human UAE TTV. A total of 56 specimens: 34 sera, 14 raw, and 8 pasteurized milk samples were tested for TTV. The results showed that the rate of infection was, 38.2% (13/34), 35.7% (5/14), and 100% (8/8), for the samples of sera, raw,and pasteurized milk respectively. The 5' untranslated region (5' UTR) of 23 clones that were generated from PCR products amplified from Camel samples (three sera, three raw, and two pasteurized milk samples) were subjected to sequence analysis. The camel TTV clones were classified as genotype 11 (47.8%), group 5 (43.5%), and SENV-H or genotype 16 (8.7%) which are among the predominant genotypes found in humans in the UAE. Phylogenetic analysis of representative sequences revealed that the similarity between isolates from camels and humans is 92%-97% for the same genotypes. The data lead to the conclusion that camels and humans share a common source of TTV infection in the UAE.

Journal of Medical Virology		2007	JAN 2007	79	1	1-7	1	7							Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno mini-virus (TTMV) are highly prevalent in the general population and although no disease has been associated with these viruses yet, co-infections with other pathological viruses are frequent. Both viruses are extremely heterogeneous, especially for DNA viruses, and the role of the immune system in controlling the infections has yet to be established. In this study the TTV/TTMV viral loads in HIV positive tissues have been investigated for the first time. The titers of both TTV and TTMV were compared in the bone marrow and spleen tissues from three groups: HIV negative individuals, HIV positive individuals and HIV positive individuals who had progressed to AIDS, leading to immunosuppression. Limiting dilution PCR using primers situated in the UTR region of the genome were used to semi-quantitate the virus, and TTV and TTMV were differentiated using melting curve analysis of the PCR product. The AIDS group had significantly higher titers compared with. both the HIV positive and negative groups for both bone marrow (AIDS vs. HIV positive P=0.006, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001) and spleen (AIDS vs. HIV positive P=0.022, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001). Analysis of TTV/TTMV titer with CD4 T lymphocyte count showed a significant inverse correlation however neither HCV co-infection or type of Anellovirus infection (single TTV or TTMV, or mixed TTV/TTMV) showed any significant correlation with virus titer. The results show a link between deterioration of the immune system and increased the viral loads in studied tissues.														0146-6615		10.1002/jmv.20756																		J	BCI:BCI200700177078	17146841			Torque teno virus (TTV): current status		Hino, Shigeo (hino@grape.med.tottori-u.ac.jp) ; Miyata, Hironori									Reviews in Medical Virology		2007	JAN-FEB 2007	17	1	45-57	45	57							Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified into the family Circoviridae, genus Anellovirus, was first found in a patient with non-A-E hepatitis. TTV has a single stranded circular DNA of similar to 3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with similar to 2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2- and 2.6-kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in > 90% of adults worldwide but no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/TTMV-related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0-, 1.2- and 1.0-kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research work.

The prevalence of two distinct TTV genogroups in 178 Spanish wild boar sera from different geographic regions, management conditions, gender and age was determined by a nested PCR method. The overall prevalence of TTV genogroups was 84% (58% for genogoup I and 66% for genogroup 2), and differences between genogroup prevalence were observed depending on the Geographical region analysed. Significantly higher prevalence for TTV genogroup 2 was found in fenced managed wild boar, juvenile animals and females. No other significant differences in TTV genogroup prevalence were observed. The phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences obtained from the untranslated region of selected samples revealed that the same TTV genogroups are infecting wild boar and domestic pig. The results indicate that TTV is apparently ubiquitous in European wild boar populations. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Annals of Saudi Medicine		2006	NOV-DEC 2006	26	6	444-449	444	449							BACKGROUND: In Saudi Arabia, the epidemiology and clinical significnance of Torque Teno virus (TTV) infection alone and in patients with hepatitis virus infections have not been determined in a single study. In this paper, we molecularly investigated the rate and genotypes of TTV infection among Saudi Arabian blood donors and patients with viral hepatitis. The effect of TTV coinfection on viral hepatitis was also examined.SUBJECTS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the sera of 200 healthy blood volunteers, 45 hepatitis B virus patients, 100 hepatitis C virus patients, 19 hepatitis G virus patients, and 56 non-A-G hepatitis patients. TTV DNA was amplified using primers derived from the ORF1 and 5'UTR regions. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was determined for each specimen. Sequencing of ORF1 amplicons was carried out to investigate TTV genotypes.RESULTS: Using primers derived from ORF1 and 5'UTR, TTV DNA was detected in 5.5% and 50.5%, respectively, of healthy blood donors, in 2.2% and 88.8% in hepatitis B patients, in 2.0% and 70% of hepatitis C patients, in 15.8% and 100% of hepatitis G patients, in 5.4% and 12.5% of non-A-G hepatitis patients and in 4.8% and 56.4% overall. No detrimental effect of TTV coinfection in viral hepatitis patients was noted. An overall prevalence of 4.8% and 56.4% was established. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most common genotype of TTV among Saudis is 2c.CONCLUSION: The rate of TTV infection among Saudi Arabians seems to be lower than that stated in previous reports on Saudi Arabia and in some other countries. The virus does not seem to worsen the status of those who are suffering from viral hepatitis infection.														0256-4947	1319-9226	10.5144/0256-4947.2006.444																		J	BCI:BCI200600661993	16940838			High torquetenovirus loads are correlated with bronchiectasis and peripheral airflow limitation in children		Pifferi, Massimo (m.pifferi@med.unipi.it) ; Maggi, Fabrizio; Caramella, Davide; De Marco, Emanuela; Andreoli, Elisabetta; Meschi, Silvia; Macchia, Pierantonio; Bendinelli, Mauro; Boner, Attilio L.									Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal		2006	SEP 2006	25	9	804-808	804	808							Background: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of torquetenovirus (TTV) infection in a group of children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and radiologic evidence of bronchiectasis. Correlations between TTV loads and severity of bronchiectasis and between TTV loads and lung function were evaluated.Methods: In 38 subjects, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and plasma tests for TTV detection and quantification were done. In 21/38 subjects, spirometry was also performed.Results: TTV was found in 31/38 (81.6%) patients. The correlation between TTV loads and severity of bronchiectasis was statistically significant (r = 0.548; P = 0.01). TTV loads showed inverse correlation with FEF25-75% (r = -0.541; P = 0.011), and FEF25-75%/FVC (r = -0.512; P = 0.018). Inverse correlation was found also between severity of bronchiectasis and functional lung parameters: FEF25-75% (r = -0.635; P = 0.002), FEV1/FVC (r = -0.541; P = 0.011), and FEF25-75%/FVC (r = -0.645; P = 0.002).Conclusions: This study demonstrated the high prevalence of TTV infection in children with bronchiectasis. Moreover, we have shown a significant correlation between TTV loads and airflow limitation within the peripheral airways, as well as between severity of bronchiectasis and decrease of lung function.

Human Torque teno virus (TTV), which displays a number of genomic similarities to CAV, is known to transcribe three mRNA species, suggesting that CAV may also have multiple mRNAs. Northern analysis of infected chicken MDCC-MSB1 cells revealed a 2.0 kb mRNA 3 h post-infection (p.i.) and additional 1.6, 1.3 and 1.2 kb bands visible at 48 and 72 h p.i. MDCC-MSB1 or COS1 cells transfected with a CAV clone showed similar results. The poly(A)(+) RNA of infected cells was subjected to RT-PCR using a suite of CAV-specific primers. The major 2.0 kb RNA reacted with every primer, but the 1.3 and 1.2 kb RNAs only annealed to certain primers. The 2.0 kb mRNA had no deletions or mutations and was capable of encoding all three known CAV proteins. The 1.3 kb RNA had a splice site joining nt 1222 to nt 1814 and encoded head/tail viral protein 1 (VP1) without a frameshift. In addition, the 1.2 kb RNA possessed a splice site joining nt 994 to nt 1095 and encoded several putative, novel proteins with frameshift mutations. These splice sites conformed to the previously described GT-AG splicing rule. One further 0.8 kb RNA species appeared to be derived from a homologous recombination event. Discovery of the presence of spliced mRNA in CAV strengthens the similarity between CAV and TTV.

Torque teno virus (TTV), the type species in the genus, was first discovered in a human patient with a post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. Recently, TTV genetically related to but distinct from those discovered in humans have also been found in animals, including pigs. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Italian pig herds and some risk factors possibly associated with this infection. Serum samples from 179 healthy pigs from 10 farms located in north-central Italy were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of swine TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in the sera of 43 pigs (24.0%), coming from eight of the 10 farms examined. Prevalence was significantly higher in finishing herds (40.1%) than in farrow-to-finish herds (11.0%) and did not depend on the size of the herd. Within the finishing herds the prevalence was significantly higher in weaners (57.4%) than in fatteners (22.9%), but this difference was not observed in farrow-to-finish herds. No relationship was observed between the prevalence of swine TTV and the implementation of some general hygiene practices and biosecurity procedures within the herds.

Besides hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, new viral agents like hepatitis G virus (HGV) and TorqueTeno virus (TTV) are identified in these patients, although their association with any pathology or disease is not yet proved. In the present work, the authors studied the clinical importance of TTV in Turkish multitransfused patients with thalassemia. Forty-six healthy and 57 thalassemic patients were enrolled in the study. TTV was detected in serum samples by 3'-UTR nested PCR. Transaminase and ferritin levels, hepatitis B and C virus markers and number of transfusions were interpreted for possible association with TTV infection. As a result, TTV was detected in 63% of the thalassemia and 54% of the control patients. Prevalence of TTV infection, clinical features, laboratory data, and annual transfusion numbers of TTV-positive and -negative patients were not observed to be statistically significant. In conclusion, in Turkish patients with thalassemia, TTV infection cannot be considered as a risk factor for liver disease.

Nested PCR (nPCR) assays to detect two distinct TTV genogroups were applied. A significantly higher prevalence of TTV infection was found in sera from PMWS-affected animals (97 %) than in sera from non-PMWS-affected animals (78 %). Whilst PMWS-affected pigs (91 %) were more likely to be infected with TTV from genogroup 2 than non-PMWS-affected swine (72 %), no such difference was observed with genogroup 1. Nucleotide sequences of nPCR products were 91-99 % identical between strains within a genogroup. In contrast, inter-genogroup sequence identities were 49-58 %. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that genogroups form different clusters without association with PMWS or porcine circovirus type 2 infection status of the animals. These results indicate a high prevalence of both swine TTV genogroups in Spain, being present more frequently in PMWS-affected animals than in non-PMWS-affected animals.

They display notably high levels of genetic diversity, but very little is known regarding the distribution of Anellovirus genetic groups in human populations. We analyzed the distribution of the major genetic groups of TTV and TTMV in healthy voluntary blood donors using group-independent and group-specific PCR amplifications systems, combined with sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis. Analysis of Anellovirus groups revealed a non-random pattern of group distribution with a predominant prevalence of TTV phylogenetic groups 1, 3, and 5, and of TTMV group 1. Multiple co-infections were observed. In addition, TTMV sequences exhibiting a high genetic divergence with reference sequences were identified. This study provided the first picture of the genetic distribution of the major phylogenetic groups of members of the genus Anellovirus in a cohort of French voluntary blood donors. Obtaining such data from a reference population comprising healthy individuals was an essential step that will allow the subsequent comparative analysis of cohorts including patients with well-characterized diseases, in order to identify any possible relationship between Anellovirus infection and human diseases.

Its presence in faeces and its remarkable environmental stability suggest the possibility of using it as an indicator of faecal contamination in the environment. To evaluate the waterborne spread of TTV and its possible relationship with human pathogen enteric viruses, water samples were collected monthly for a year (May 2004-April 2005) from a river receiving the effluent of the treatment plant of the city of Pisa, concentrated and assayed with bimolecular tests (PCR, RT-PCR). TTV was detected in three samples (25%) while 16% of samples were positive for enteroviruses, 33% for rotaviruses, 8% for noroviruses genotype 1 and 25% for noroviruses genotype 2. Only two TTV samples (June and January) were also positive for rotavirus and norovirus, respectively. The detection of TTV in water confirmed its possible faecal-oral route of transmission but data are still insufficient to draw conclusions about the role of TTV as a viral indicator.

Water Science and Technology		2006		54	3	239-244	239	244							In the aim of studying possible relations between viruses detected in clinical specimens and the ones found in different environmental matrices, in the period May 2004 to April 2005, the collection of faecal samples from gastroenteritis cases and the monthly monitoring of raw and treated wastewater, river water, seawater and mussels were carried out. The viruses considered for environmental monitoring were adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Torque teno virus (TTV): they were searched for with PCR and RT-PCR and confirmed by gene sequencing. Faecal coliforms and somatic coliphages' counts were also determined. The surveillance of case detected 45 positive faecal samples out of 255 (17.6%) while 35 of 56 environmental samples (62.5%) resulted positive for at least one of the considered viruses. The detection of the same viral strain in the faeces of gastroenteritis cases and in water was possible for adenovirus and rotavirus, which were also predominant in environmental matrices; thus they could be considered as a reference for risk assessment.

(niel@ioc.fiocruz.br)									Brazilian Journal of Medical and Biological Research		2005	JUN 2005	38	6	853-860	853	860							Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular, single-stranded DNA virus that chronically infects healthy individuals of all ages worldwide. TTV has an extreme genetic heterogeneity which is reflected in its current classification into five main phylogenetic groups (1-5). Using specific PCR assays, it has been shown that many individuals are co-infected with TTV isolates belonging to different phylogenetic groups. Here, a multiplex PCR assay was developed, using five recombinant plasmids. Each plasmid carried an insert of different size issued from a TTV isolate belonging to a different group. The assay was able to simultaneously amplify DNAs of TTV isolates belonging to all five phylogenetic groups. Multiplex PCR was then tested satisfactorily on DNAs extracted from 55 serum samples (47 health care workers and 8 AIDS patients). All individuals but nine were infected with at least one TTV isolate. Co-infection with multiple isolates was found in 29/47 (62 %) health care workers and in 8/8 (100 %) AIDS patients. A number of discrepancies were observed when results obtained with three thermostable DNA polymerases were compared. For example, four TTV phylogenetic groups were detected in a particular serum sample by using one of the three DNA polymerases, whereas the other two enzymes were able to detect only three TTV groups. However, none of the three enzymes used could be broadly considered to be more efficient than the others. Despite its limitations, the assay described here constitutes a suitable tool to visualize the degree of co-infection of a given population, avoiding time-consuming experiments.

In an attempt to detect Torque teno virus (TTV), rolling-circle amplification was used to amplify DNA extracted from eight human and four pig serum samples. All samples gave high molecular weight (> 30 kb) amplification products. By restriction endonuclease digestion, these products generated DNA fragments whose sizes were consistent with those of human TTV (3-8 kb) and swine TTV (Sd-TTV; 2-9 kb) genomes. Two TTV isolates derived from a single AIDS patient, as well as two Sd-TTV isolates derived from a single pig, were characterized by complete nucleotide sequencing. One of the Scl-TTV isolates showed very low (43-45%) nucleotide sequence similarity to the other Sd-TTV isolate and to the prototype isolate Sd-TTV31, and could be considered the prototype of a novel genogroup.

Sixty-four samples were collected from six sites along the river, and 500 ml of the sample was concentrated using the cation-coated filter method, which was developed in our previous study. This method showed recovery yields of 56% +/- 32% (n = 37) for surface water samples inoculated with polioviruses. More than one kind of tested virus was detected in 43 (67%) of 64 samples by TaqMan PCR. Noroviruses and adenoviruses were detected in a high positive ratio; 34 (53%), 28 (44%), and 29 (45%) of 64 samples were positive for norovirus genotype 1 and genotype 2 and adenoviruses, respectively. The mean concentrations of norovirus genotype 1 or genotype 2 determined by real-time PCR were 0.087 and 0.61 genome/ml, respectively, showing much higher values in winter (0.21 genome/ml for genotype 1 and 2.3 genomes/ml for genotype 2). Enteroviruses were detected by both direct PCR (6 of 64 samples; 9%) and cell culture PCR (2 of 64 samples; 3%). Torque teno viruses, emerging hepatitis viruses, were also isolated in three samples (5%). The concentration of total coliforms and the presence of F-specific phages showed a high correlation with the presence of viruses, which suggested that the simultaneous use of total coliforms and F-specific phages as indicators of surface water may work to monitor viral contamination.

Wastewater samples were collected monthly from eight wastewater treatment plants in Japan for 1 year, from July 2003 to June 2004, and tested for the presence of TTV by TaqMan PCR. TTV was detected in 97% (93/96) of influent samples, implying that TTV is epidemic in Japan. TTV was also isolated in 18% (17/96) of secondary effluent samples before chlorination and in 24% (23/95) of final effluent samples after chlorination. There was no significant difference between the concentration of total coliform in TTV-positive final effluents and that in TTV-negative final effluents, which indicates that total coliform cannot be used as an indicator of TTV. No TTV was detected in 24 effluents for reuse from two wastewater treatment plants using sand filtration and ozonation. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The levels of TTV vary in patients co-infected with other viruses and there has been considerable speculation as to whether TTV contributes to pathogenesis by other viruses or if the varying levels might be related to immune activation in the host. In the present study, the load of TTV was examined in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following immunization of subjects with either influenza (a recall antigen) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (a new antigenic exposure). The results overall did not indicate a significant change in TTV titers over a 90 day observation period; however, when TTV genogroup was taken into consideration there was an increase in viral load in plasma at some time points for subjects persistently infected with genogroup 3. While this was observed in both influenza and HBV immunized subjects, the effect was more profound in HBV vaccination. Thus, it appears that exposure to a new antigen rather than a recall antigen may stimulate TTV replication more effectively. The data further suggest that investigating the interactions between TTV and its host might require to examine specifically each TTV genogroup separately in order to determine if certain TTV types have any role in disease pathogenesis.

Transient-transfection assays using reporter constructs revealed that a 113-nucleotide (nt) sequence within the untranslated region, proximal to the transcription initiation site and containing a TATA box motif, has a basal promoter activity. This sequence is well conserved among different TTV genotypes. Upstream stimulating factor bound to a consensus binding motif within this region and positively regulates TTV transcription. Furthermore, a 488-nt region upstream of the basal promoter exhibited enhancer activity, presumably in a cell type-specific manner. This study illustrates some of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of TTV.
