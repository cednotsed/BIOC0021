AB  - Background: High viral loads are observed in Torque Teno Virus (TTV) infection after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). We aimed to analyze the kinetics of plasma TTV-DNA load in pediatric patients who received immunosuppressive therapy and developed infection complications in the first 100 days after HSCT. Methods: As a patient group; 113 plasma samples taken from 33 pediatric HSCT recipients at a time interval after transplantation and as a control group; 38 plasma samples from 38 children without known chronic disease were included in the study. Viral nucleic acid isolation was performed by using the NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMerieux, France) system. A laboratory designed quantitative polymerase chain reaction process was performed on 7300 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA) with the amplification mixture containing primer and probe sequences for the UTR gene region. Results: TTV-DNA was detected in all patient's samples and the median viral load was calculated as 7.67 Log10 copies/mL (range: 2.84–9.59). In the control group, the TTV-DNA median viral load was calculated as 5.51 Log10 copies/mL (range: 2.50–7.04), except for one negative sample. A significant difference was observed between the control group and the patient group in terms of TTV viral load levels. In nine patients, a median 2.15 Log10 copies/mL viral load increase was observed at 31–60 days post-transplant compared to the pre-transplant period. Conclusion: TTV-DNA levels should be closely monitored to understand the immune status of the first 100 days after transplantation and the effects of treatment regimens on patients with HSCT. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is the viral agent responsible for the pandemic that in the first months of 2020 caused about 400,000 deaths. Among compounds proposed to fight the SARS-CoV-2-related disease (COVID-19), tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), already effective in Philadelphia-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia (Ph+ ALL) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), have been proposed on the basis of their antiviral action already demonstrated against SARS-CoV-1. Very few cases of COVID-19 have been reported in Ph+ ALL and in CML Italian cohorts; authors suggested that this low rate of infections might depend on the use of TKIs, but the biological causes of this phenomenon remain unknown. In this study, the CML model was used to test if TKIs would sustain or not the viral replication and if they could damage patient immunity. Firstly, the infection and replication rate of torquetenovirus (TTV), whose load is inversely proportional to the host immunological control, have been measured in CML patients receiving nilotinib. A very low percentage of subjects were infected at baseline, and TTV did not replicate or at least showed a low replication rate during the follow-up, with a mean load comparable to the measured one in healthy subjects. Then, after gene expression profiling experiments, we found that several “antiviral” genes, such as CD28 and IFN gamma, were upregulated, while genes with “proviral” action, such as ARG-1, CEACAM1, and FUT4, were less expressed during treatment with imatinib, thus demonstrating that TKIs are not detrimental from the immunological point of view. To sum up, our data could offer some biological explanations to the low COVID-19 occurrence in Ph+ ALL and CML patients and sustain the use of TKIs in COVID-19, as already proposed by several international ongoing studies. © Copyright © 2020 Galimberti, Petrini, Baratè, Ricci, Balducci, Grassi, Guerrini, Ciabatti, Mechelli, Di Paolo, Baldini, Baglietto, Macera, Spezia and Maggi.

AB  - The imprints left by persistent DNA viruses in the tissues can testify to the changes driving virus evolution as well as provide clues on the provenance of modern and ancient humans. However, the history hidden in skeletal remains is practically unknown, as only parvovirus B19 and hepatitis B virus DNA have been detected in hard tissues so far. Here, we investigated the DNA prevalences of 38 viruses in femoral bone of recently deceased individuals. To this end, we used quantitative PCRs and a custom viral targeted enrichment followed by next-generation sequencing. The data was analyzed with a tailor-made bioinformatics pipeline. Our findings revealed bone to be a much richer source of persistent DNA viruses than earlier perceived, discovering ten additional ones, including several members of the herpes- and polyomavirus families, as well as human papillomavirus 31 and torque teno virus. Remarkably, many of the viruses found have oncogenic potential and/or may reactivate in the elderly and immunosuppressed individuals. Thus, their persistence warrants careful evaluation of their clinical significance and impact on bone biology. Our findings open new frontiers for the study of virus evolution from ancient relics as well as provide new tools for the investigation of human skeletal remains in forensic and archaeological contexts. © 2020

AB  - Purpose: To associate detection of potential pathogen DNA in endophthalmitis with clinical outcomes. Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Patients in whom endophthalmitis was diagnosed following an intraocular procedure were recruited. Clinical outcome data from baseline, week-1, month-1, and month-3 visits were collected. Intraocular biopsy samples were cultured by standard methods. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for specific pathogens and whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Results: A total of 50 patients (mean age 72 years old; 52% male) were enrolled. Twenty-four cases were culture-positive and 26 were culture-negative. WGS identified the cultured organism in 76% of culture-positive cases and identified potential pathogens in 33% of culture-negative cases. Month-1 and -3 visual acuities did not vary by pathogen-positive versus pathogen-negative cases as detected by either culture or WGS. Visual outcomes of Staphylococcus epidermidis endophthalmitis were no different than those of pathogen-negative cases, whereas the patients infected with other pathogens showed worse outcome. Higher baseline bacterial DNA loads of bacteria other than those of S epidermidis detected by WGS were associated with worse month-1 and -3 visual acuity, whereas the S epidermidis loads did not appear to influence outcomes. Torque teno virus (TTV) and Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV) were detected by qPCR in 49% and 19% of cases, respectively. Presence of TTV at presentation was associated with a higher rate of secondary pars plana vitrectomy (P =.009) and retinal detachment (P =.022). Conclusions: The presence and higher load of bacteria other than S epidermidis detected by WGS or DNA from TTV by qPCR in ocular fluids is associated with worse outcomes in post-procedure endophthalmitis. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic emphasizes the need to actively study the virome of unexplained respiratory diseases. We performed viral metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) analysis of 91 nasal-throat swabs from individuals working with animals and with acute respiratory diseases. Fifteen virus RT-PCR-positive samples were included as controls, while the other 76 samples were RT-PCR negative for a wide panel of respiratory pathogens. Eukaryotic viruses detected by mNGS were then screened by PCR (using primers based on mNGS-derived contigs) in all samples to compare viral detection by mNGS versus PCR and assess the utility of mNGS in routine diagnostics. mNGS identified expected human rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, influenza A virus, coronavirus OC43, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A in 13 of 15 (86.7%) positive control samples. Additionally, rotavirus, torque teno virus, human papillomavirus, human betaherpesvirus 7, cyclovirus, vientovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were identified through mNGS. Notably, complete genomes of novel cyclovirus, gemycircularvirus, and statovirus were genetically characterized. Using PCR screening, the novel cyclovirus was additionally detected in 5 and the novel gemycircularvirus in 12 of the remaining samples included for mNGS analysis. Our studies therefore provide pioneering data of the virome of acute-respiratory diseases from individuals at risk of zoonotic infections. The mNGS protocol/pipeline applied here is sensitive for the detection of a variety of viruses, including novel ones. More frequent detections of the novel viruses by PCR than by mNGS on the same samples suggests that PCR remains the most sensitive. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are small, ubiquitous, viruses with a highly diverse, single-stranded, negative sense DNA genome and wide host range. They are detected at high rates in both healthy and diseased individuals and are considered a significant part of the mammalian virome. Similar to human TTVs, swine TTVs (TTSuVs) are epidemiologically linked to several coinfections including porcine circovirus types 2 and 3 and the porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome virus. Experimental infection of gnotobiotic pigs with TTSuVs resulted in lesions in multiple organs and exacerbation of coinfections, making TTSuVs the only members of the Anelloviridae family with experimental evidence for pathogenicity. However, due to the lack of reliable cell culture and animal models, mechanistic studies on viral immunity and pathogenesis are limited. The objective of this review is to summarize the current status of knowledge regarding the biology, detection, pathogenesis and public health significance of TTSuVs, while identifying gaps in knowledge which limit the field. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The nonpathogenic and ubiquitous torque teno virus (TTV) is associated with immunosuppression in solid organ transplant recipients. Studies in kidney transplant patients proposed TTV quantification for risk stratification of graft rejection and infection. In this prospective trial (DRKS00012335) 386 consecutive kidney transplant recipients were subjected to longitudinal per-protocol monitoring of plasma TTV load by polymerase chain reaction for 12 months posttransplant. TTV load peaked at the end of month 3 posttransplant and reached steady state thereafter. TTV load after the end of month 3 was analyzed in the context of subsequent rejection diagnosed by indication biopsy and infection within the first year posttransplant, respectively. Each log increase in TTV load decreased the odds for rejection by 22% (odds ratio [OR] 0.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.62-0.97; P =.027) and increased the odds for infection by 11% (OR 1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.15; P &lt;.001). TTV was quantified at a median of 14 days before rejection was diagnosed and 27 days before onset of infection, respectively. We defined a TTV load between 1 × 106 and 1 × 108 copies/mL as optimal range to minimize the risk for rejection and infection. These data support the initiation of an interventional trial assessing the efficacy of TTV-guided immunosuppression to reduce infection and graft rejection in kidney transplant recipients. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - As the outbreaks of COVID-19 in worldwide, coronavirus has once again caught the attention of people. Canine coronavirus is widespread among dog population, and sometimes causes even fatal cases. Here, to characterize the prevalence and evolution of current circulating canine coronavirus (CCoV) strains in China, we collected 213 fecal samples from diarrheic pet dogs between 2018 and 2019. Of the 213 samples, we found 51 (23.94%) were positive for CCoV. Co-infection with canine parvovirus (CPV), canine astrovirus (CaAstV), canine kobuvirus (CaKV), Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) were ubiquitous existed. Mixed infection of different CCoV subtypes exists extensively. Considering the limited sequences data in recent years, we sequenced 7 nearly complete genomes and 10 complete spike gene. Phylogenetic analysis of spike gene revealed a new subtype CCoV-II Variant and CCoV-IIa was the most prevalent subtype currently circulating. Moreover, we identified strain B906_ZJ_2019 shared 93.24% nucleotide identifies with previous strain A76, and both of them clustered with CCoV-II Variant, which were not well clustered with the known subtypes. Recombination analysis of B906_ZJ_2019 indicated that strain B906_ZJ_2019 may a recombinant variant between CCoV–I and CCoV-II, which is consistent with strain A76. Furthermore, amino acid variations widely existed among current CCoV-IIa strains circulating in China and the classic CCoV-IIa strains, in spite of the unknown functions. In a word, we report a useful information as to the etiology and evolution of canine coronavirus in China based on the available sequences, which is urgent for the devise of future effective disease prevention and control strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - BACKGROUND: Herpesviruses and bacteria and their interplay have long been believed to play important roles in the pathogenesis of periodontitis, but other microbial entities in the oral environment might also be involved. Anelloviruses are commonly detected in human, including in oral samples. The aim of the present study was to explore the occurrence and co-occurrence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and human anelloviruses (HTTVs) in gingival tissue samples collected from participants recruited in Shanghai, China. METHODS: Gingival tissues were collected from 159 participants (57 with aggressive periodontitis (AP), 59 with chronic periodontitis (CP) and 43 with healthy periodontal status). The presence of HCMV, EBV, torque teno virus (TTV), torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) DNA was detected by nested-PCR. The virus loads were quantified by real-time PCR. RESULTS: The detection rates of EBV, TTV, TTMV and TTMDV were significantly higher in the AP and CP groups compared to the healthy group (all P < 0.01). A statistically significant association was found between EBV, TTV and TTMV virus load and periodontitis (all P < 0.05). Participants infected with EBV showed significantly higher infection rates and higher virus loads of TTV and TTMV than the EBV-negative group (all P < 0.05). The coexistence rates of EBV and anelloviruses and the coexistence of three HTTVs were significantly higher in AP and CP groups (all P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, results obtained in this study suggest that HTTVs and the coexistence of EBV and HTTVs in particular, may be associated with periodontitis. Possible mechanisms of the interaction between herpesviruses and anelloviruses in the context of periodontitis require further investigation.

AB  - Background: Human-resident microbes can influence both health and disease. Investigating the microbiome using next-generation sequencing technology has revealed examples of mutualism and conflict between microbes and humans. Comparing to bacteria, the viral component of the microbiome (i.e., the "virome") is understudied. Somatic tissues of healthy individuals are usually inaccessible for the virome sampling; therefore, there is limited understanding of the presence and distribution of viruses in tissues in healthy individuals and how virus infection associates with human gene expression and perturbs immunological homeostasis. Results: To characterize the human virome in a tissue-specific manner, here we performed meta-transcriptomic analysis using the RNA-sequencing dataset from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project. We analyzed the 8991 RNA-sequencing data obtained from 51 somatic tissues from 547 individuals and successfully detected 39 viral species in at least one tissue. We then investigated associations between virus infection and human gene expression and human disease onset. We detected some expected relationships; for instance, hepatitis C virus infection in the liver was strongly associated with interferon-stimulated gene upregulation and pathological findings of chronic hepatitis. The presence of herpes simplex virus type 1 in one subject's brain strongly associated with immune gene expression. While torque teno virus was detected in a broad range of human tissues, it was not associated with interferon responses. Being notable in light of its association with lymphoproliferative disorders, Epstein-Barr virus infection in the spleen and blood was associated with an increase in plasma cells in healthy subjects. Human herpesvirus 7 was often detected in the stomach; intriguingly, it associated with the proportion of human leukocytes in the stomach as well as digestive gene expression. Moreover, virus infections in the local tissues associated with systemic immune responses in circulating blood. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this study is the first comprehensive investigation of the human virome in a variety of tissues in healthy individuals through meta-transcriptomic analysis. Further investigation of the associations described here, and application of this analytical pipeline to additional datasets, will be useful to reveal the impact of viral infections on human health. © 2020 The Author(s).

AB  - The SEN virus (SENV) has been linked to transfusion-associated non-A-E hepatitis; however, information regarding SENV infections in patients with thalassemia, particularly in those with hepatitis virus co-infections, remains limited. This study investigated the frequency of SENV (genotypes D and H) infections in Iraqi patients with thalassemic patients infected and not infected with hepatitis C virus. The study involved 150 β-thalassemia patients (75 with HCV infections and 75 without) and 75 healthy blood donors. Patient levels of vitamins C and E, liver function markers, and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) were determined. Recovered viral nucleic acids were amplified using the conventional polymerase chain reaction (SENV DNA) or the real-time polymerase chain reaction (HCV RNA) techniques. Only 10% of healthy donors had evidence of SENV infection. Among patients with thalassemia, 80% and 77% of patients with and without concurrent HCV infections, respectively, had SENV infections. DNA sequencing analyses were performed on blood samples obtained from 29 patients. Patients with thalassemia, particularly those with SENV infections, had higher levels of several enzymatic liver function markers and total serum bilirubin (P < 0.05) than did healthy blood donors. Among the examined liver function markers, only gamma-glutamyl transferase demonstrated significantly higher levels in HCV-negative patients infected with SENV-H than in those infected with SENV-D (P = 0.01). There were significantly lower vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione peroxidase levels in patients than in healthy donors (P < 0.05), but only glutathione peroxidase levels were significantly lower in HCV-negative thalassemia patients infected with SENV than in those without SENV infections (P = 0.04). The SENV-H genotype sequences were similar to the global standard genes in GenBank. These results broaden our understanding the nature of the SENV-H genotype and the differential role of SENV-H infections, compared to SENV-D infections, in patients with thalassemia, in Iraq. © 2020 Al-Ouqaili et al.

AB  - In prior studies, the transit service reliability has been looked at from the passenger's perspective in terms of time spent by the passengers in waiting for their bus to arrive at a stop. The operators'/agencies' perspective based on analyzing day to day travel time variability (TTV) gives a clear picture about transit service reliability but is not a well-researched area, partly because of limited access to comprehensive data sets of bus travel times. The present study used citywide global positioning system (GPS) data of bus rapid transit system (BRTS) operating in Ahmedabad city of India to carry out the travel time reliability analysis. A three-level TTV analysis was carried out in the present study (i.e., segment, route, and network level). The route level analysis dealt with observing the day to day and within the day TTV. Whereas, in the segment level analysis, the BRTS routes were divided into segments based on criteria of shared and unshared routes. Two travel time variability (TTV) models (considering different dependent variables) were then developed using 770 observations to analyze the factors causing variability in travel time (TT). The model was developed considering the linear regression technique, and the significant variables in the suggested model were selected based on the backward stepwise selection method. The TTR model with T90-T10 (90th minus 10th percentile travel time) as dependent variable was showing a better adjusted R2 value (i.e., 0.73). The model revealed that the independent variables like length, bus stops, and number of intersections affect TTR to a larger extent. The third part of the TTR analysis was based on developing level-of-service (LOS) criteria for comparing TTR of transit systems. Transit's network level data was used to propose a revised LOS based on weighted delay index (WDI) which is an improvement over the conventional LOS criteria. K-mean clustering was used to classify WDI into groups wherein each group corresponded to a certain transit service level. The mean of the silhouette coefficient was estimated to be 0.5 which highlighted that the structure of the clusters was reasonable. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Impaired immune reconstitution after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) contributes to increased risk of cancer relapse and infection resulting in significant morbidity and mortality. Unfortunately, effective strategies to functionally assess the quality of immune reconstitution are still missing. Quantification of in vivo replication of the ubiquitous, non-pathogenic virus Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been reported in small series as a test to functionally evaluate the quality of post-transplant immune reconstitution. In the present study, we analyzed by quantitative PCR TTV titers in plasma samples from a large cohort of 168 allogeneic HSCT recipients. Our analysis confirms that TTV titers peaked at 100 days post-transplant, followed by progressive normalization thereafter. Negative correlation of TTV titers with T cell absolute numbers during the first year post-transplant points to the restoration of an active anti-TTV immunity. Univariable and multivariable linear regression analysis demonstrated that donor CMV positive serostatus, donor type and immune suppression resulting from GVHD treatment affected the restoration of anti-TTV immunity. Importantly, higher TTV titers at 100 days after transplantation were associated with worse overall survival and higher risk of acute GVHD and infections. Our results provide new insights into the factors affecting the dynamics of TTV replication and indicate that TTV is a potentially useful biomarker to assess immune reconstitution and to predict complications and outcomes of allogeneic HSCT. © Copyright © 2020 Pradier, Masouridi-Levrat, Bosshard, Dantin, Vu, Zanella, Boely, Tapparel, Kaiser, Chalandon, Simonetta and Roosnek.

AB  - Because broad genetic diversity has recently been detected in Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), the viral genome detection method needs to be improved to understand the prevalence of these viruses. Here, we established single PCR-based detection methods for the TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a genomes with newly designed primer pairs and applied them to investigate the prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a in Japanese pig populations. The results revealed that 98.2% and 81.7% of the pig farms tested positive for the TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a genomes, respectively, indicating that both TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a are widespread in Japan. © 2020 The Societies and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd

AB  - Single stranded (ss) DNA viruses are increasingly being discovered due to the ongoing development of modern technologies in exploring the virosphere. Characterized by high rates of recombination and nucleotide substitutions, it could be comparable to RNA virus ones. Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a standard ssDNA virus with a high population diversity, whose evolution is still obscure, further, it is frequently found in co-infections with other viruses threatening the porcine industry and therefore share the same host and epidemiological context. Here, we implement and describe approach to integrate viral nucleotide sequence analysis, surveillance data, and a structural approach to examine the evolution of TTSuVs, we collected samples from pigs displaying respiratory signs in China and revealed a high prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2, frequently as part of co-infections with porcine circoviruses (PCVs), especially in spleen and lung. In addition, thirty six strains sequenced were obtained to investigate their genetic diversity in China. The evolutionary history of TTSuVs were unveiled as following: At the nucleotide sequence level, TTSuVs ORF1 was confirmed to be a robust phylogenetic maker to study evolution comparably to full genomes. Additionally, extensive recombination discovered within TTSuVk2a (also 5 out of the 36 sequenced strains in this study revealed to be recombination). Then, pairwise distance, phylogenetic trees, and amino acid analysis confirmed TTSuVs species, and allowed to define circulating genotypes (TTSuV1a-1, 1a-2, 1b-1, 1b-2, 1b-3, and k2a-1, k2a-2, k2b). Selection analysis uncovered seven and six positive selected sites in TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2, respectively. At the protein structure level, mapping of sites onto the three-dimensional structure revealed that several positive selected sites locate into potential epitopes, which might related to the potential escaping from host immune response. Our result could assist future studies on swine ssDNA virus classification, surveillance and control. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Anelloviruses are small, single stranded circular DNA viruses. They are extremely diverse and have not been associated with any disease so far. Strikingly, these small entities infect most probably the complete human population, and there are no convincing examples demonstrating viral clearance from infected individuals. The main transmission could be via fecal-oral or airway route, as infections occur at an early age. However, due to the lack of an appropriate culture system, the virus-host interactions remain enigmatic. Anelloviruses are obviously mysterious viruses, and their impact on human life is not yet known, but, with no evidence of a disease association, a potential beneficial effect on human health should also be investigated. © FEMS 2020.

AB  - Porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) is an emerging and re-emerging epizootic virus of swine that causes substantial economic losses to the pig industry in China and other countries. The variations in the virus, and its co-infections with other enteric viruses, have contributed to the poor control of PEDV infection. In the current study, a broad epidemiological investigation of PEDV was carried out in 22 provinces or municipalities of China during 2015–2018. The enteric viruses causing co-infection with PEDV and the genetic diversity of the PEDV S1 gene were also analysed. The results indicated that, of the 543 diarrhoea samples, 66.85% (363/543) were positive for PEDV, and co-infection rates of PEDV with 13 enteric viruses ranged from 3.58% (13/363) to 81.55% (296/363). Among these enteric viruses, the signs of diarrhoea induced by PEDV were potentially associated with co-infections with porcine enterovirus 9/10 (PEV) and torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2) (p <.05). The 147 PEDV strains identified in our study belong to Chinese pandemic strains and exhibited genetic diversity. The virulence-determining S1 proteins of PEDV pandemic strains were undergoing amino acid mutations, in which S58_S58insQGVN–N135dup–D158_I159del-like mutations were common patterns (97.28%, 143/147). When compared with 2011–2014 PEDV strains, the amino acid mutations of PEDV pandemic strains were mainly located in the N-terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD), and 21 novel mutations occurred in 2017 and 2018. Furthermore, protein homology modelling showed that the mutations in pattern of insertion and deletion mutations of the S1 protein of PEDV pandemic strains may have caused structural changes on the surface of the S1 protein. These data provide a better understanding of the co-infection and genetic evolution of PEDV in China. © 2019 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - The review presents the data accumulated for more than 20 years of research of torque teno virus (TTV). Its molecular genetic structure, immunobiology, epidemiology, diagnostic methods, possible replication sites, and pathogenicity factors are described. TTV is a virus that is frequently detectable in patients with different viral hepatitides, in cases of hepatitis without an obvious viral agent, as well as in a healthy population. There is evidence suggesting that biochemical and histological changes occur in liver tissue and bile duct epithelium in TTV monoinfection. There are sufficient histological signs of liver damage, which confirm that the virus can undergo a replicative cycle in hepatocytes. Along with this, cytological hybridization in TTV-infected cells has shown no substantial cytopathic (cell-damaging) effects that are characteristic of pathogenic hepatotropic viruses. Studying TTV has led to the evolution of views on its role in the development of human pathology. The first ideas about the hepatotropism of the virus were gradually reformed as new data became available on the prevalence of the virus and its co-infection with other viruses, including the viruses of the known types of hepatitides. The high prevalence of TTV in the human population indicates its persistence in the body as a virome and a nonpathogenic virus. It has recently been proposed that the level of TTV DNA in the blood of patients undergoing organ transplantation should be used as an endogenous marker of the body's immune status. The available data show the polytropism of the virus and deny the fact that TTV can be assigned exclusively to hepatitis viruses. Fortunately, the rare detection of the damaging effect of TTV on hepatic and bile duct epithelial cells may be indirect evidence of its conditionally pathogenic properties. The ubiquity of the virus and the variability of its existence in humans cannot put an end to its study. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded, circular DNA virus of the family of Anelloviridae. The first contact with TTV usually occurs in early childhood, followed by persistent infection in bone marrow and lymphocytes. Increased levels of TTV-DNA are found in the serum in various states of immune deficiency. The objective of this study was to assess if monitoring of TTV viremia after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is a predictive marker for immune-related clinical complications. In a retrospective study, 2054 whole-blood samples from 123 patients were tested for viral loads of TTV-DNA by real-time PCR within 345 days after allo-HSCT. We enrolled all patients who underwent allo-HSCT between September 2015 and April 2018. Clinical and laboratory data were collected and statistically analyzed. Patients with an underlying lymphatic malignancy had significantly higher torque teno (TT) viral loads compared with patients with an underlying malignant myeloid disease (P < .05). Complete remission before allo-HSCT correlated significantly with higher TT viral loads after allo-HSCT (P < .05). Myeloablative conditioning regimens led to significantly higher TT viral loads than reduced-intensity conditioning regimens (P < .05). A higher anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) dose was associated with a significantly higher TT viral load. We did not observe any significant differences of TT viral load correlating with accompanying clinically relevant events such as virus reactivations (cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Adenovirus), acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD), relapse, or death. TT viral load after allo-HSCT did weakly correlate with T cell, T suppressor cell, T helper cell, and natural killer and B cell count. Although statistically significant differences between study groups were observed, virus reactivations, aGVHD, and clinical outcomes could not be predicted by monitoring TTV viremia. Therefore, TTV seems not to be suitable as a marker for the degree of immunosuppression or as a prognostic marker for clinically critical events in patients after allo-HSCT. © 2019 American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy

AB  - PURPOSE: Long-term survival after heart transplant is still limited due to immunological and drug related adverse events. Immunosuppressive therapy is solely managed via pharmacokinetic analysis and clinical events. TTV (Torque Teno Virus) is a small single-stranded DNA virus associated with increasing viral load under immune compromising conditions. Studies in both kidney and lung transplantation have already shown that the level of plasma TTV - DNA load is associated with the magnitude of immunosuppression. The aim of this prospective observational study was to analyze TTV viral load in patients after heart transplantation (HTX). METHODS: We prospectively determined the TTV load in 50 heart transplant patients. Samples were collected at pre-transplant and each HTX visit in the out-patient clinic. Viral load analysis was performed by PCR from plasma or serum on the Department of Virology. TTV viral load was compared between pre-transplant and peak levels post transplant. Pre-TX TTV load was compared between different patient groups and between different immunosuppressive protocols after transplantation. RESULTS: Patients were transplanted between 1/2016-6/2018. Median age at transplant was 60 (42-67) years and 38% were female. 50%(n=25) of patients were transplanted due to ischemic disease, 44% (n=22) due to dilative Cardiomyopathy and 6% (n=3) due to other disease. 16% of patients were bridged with a mechanical assist device (n=8). Pretransplant TTV levels were 4.4E+00±2.03E+00 cps/ml and significantly increased to 9.39E+00 ±0.75E+00 (p<0.001) at the TTV peak levels at a median time of 121 (92-185) days post-transplant. Pretransplant, VAD bridged patients had significantly higher TTV loads than non-bridged patients (4,02±1,97E+00 vs. 5,93±0,63 E+00, p=0.023). This difference disappeared after 90-120 days post transplant (120d: VAD: 8.72±0,74 E+00 vs. no VAD: 8,49±1,17 E+00, p=n.s.). CONCLUSION: TTV viral load increases significantly after heart transplantation and reaches its peak after 90-120 days. VAD pretransplant has an influence of TTV viral load and the choice of calcineurin inhibitor drug seems to be associated with differences in TTV viral load. TTV viral load might be useful as a biomarker for the state of immunosuppression. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - PURPOSE: New biomarkers reflecting the degree of immunosuppression in transplant recipients are needed to provide an optimal balance between risk for rejection and risk of severe infections. METHODS: We prospectively measured plasma TTV-DNA dynamics in 365 lung transplant recipients (LuTR) transplanted between 1/2013 and 12/2020. Severe infections, acute cellular and humoral rejection, incidence of CLAD and malignancies were recorded and correlated with dynamic changes in TTV levels. RESULTS: Patient demographics are summarized in Table 1. 95% of patients had detectable TTV levels pre-transplant with a mean log value of 4.0±1.6. Post-transplant, all LuTR became TTV positive with a peak value of log9.6±0.6 (range 5.9-10.9). TTV peaked at a mean of 143±109 days after transplantation. Mean TTV PCR values after 3, 4 and 5 years were log6.9±1,4, log6,4±1,4 and log6.0±1.2, respectively. TTV loads were significantly lower in LuTR who had episodes of acute cellular rejection (TTV PCR <log7.0 for more than 3 months[K1]; p=0.001) or who later developed chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) (p<0.05). Furthermore, TTV loads higher than log9.5 for a longer time [K2] correlated with episodes of severe infections (p<0.05) or the development of malignancies (p<0.05). No correlation between TTV load and episodes of acute/chronic antibody mediated rejection was found[K3]. FK levels were in 95% of all patients within the target levels and didn't correlate with infectious episodes or incidence of CLAD. CONCLUSION: TTV PCR measurement is a potent tool to predict acute cellular rejection episodes, infectious complications and CLAD. It represents a promising tool to monitor individualized immunosuppressive therapy in near future. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Due to the high number of transfusions which patients with hereditary hemoglobinopathies (thalassemia, sickle cell disease) receive, they represent high risk of acquiring parenterally transmitted infectious diseases. In this respect, non pathogenic human commensal viruses, which also demonstrate parenteral transmission routes might also be acquired. One of the most widely spread parenterally-transmitted human commensal viruses include the Human Pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1, GBV-C) and Torque teno viruses (TTV) including its SEN virus-like (SENV) forms. The objective of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA and SENV-like viruses, among a group of patients with beta-thalassemia from a Blood Transfusion Center in the São Paulo State, Brazil. The prevalence of HPgV-1 RNA was 14.3 % (n = 6/42) and all of the positive samples were characterized as belonging to genotype 2 (83.3 % were referred to subgenotype 2A and 16.7 % to 2B). The prevalence of SENV-like viruses was 28.6 % (n = 12/42). SENV-like viruses of the genotypes SENV-H and SENV-A were classified during the performed phylogenetic analysis. Our study came as a continuation of a viral metagenomic survey among multiple transfused patients with beta-thalassemia. The obtained results shed a light on the prevalence and genotype distribution of commensal parenterally transmitted viruses like HPgV-1 and SENV in this specific population. However, more studies are needed to evaluate the clinical impact of these apparently non-pathogenic viruses in patients with thalassemia and their significance for the hemotherapy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare benign lymphadenitis that mainly involves cervical lymph nodes of young Asian women with unknown etiology. Recently, we experienced a case of KFD found with Torque teno virus/Torque teno-like mini virus (TTV/TTMV) from a 26-year-old woman. TTV/TTMV is a genus of Circoviridae that causes necrotizing lymphadenitis in pigs, which shares the key histologic finding of KFD. The purpose of this study is to investigate the pathogenic role of TTV/TTMV in KFD by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis. Method: We performed two-step qPCR specific to TTV/TTMV with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue of sequentially selected 100 KFD patients and 50 randomly selected, matched normal controls. Consequent direct sequencing was done for confirmation with PCR products. Results: PCR amplification of TTV and TTMV was found in a significantly higher proportion in KFDs than normal controls (TTV, 85% vs. 18%, p < 0.000; TTMV, 91% vs. 24%, p < 0.000). After the sequencing, KFD samples showed more sequence matching than control samples for TTMV (94% vs. 30%, p < 0.000). Conclusion: This finding strongly suggests the possible implication of TTV/TTMV in the pathogenesis of KFD. Animal or in vivo experimental design should be followed in the future.Key Points• Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (KFD) is rare and its etiology is still unclear.• Torque teno/Torque teno-like minivirus (TTV/TTMV) is a recently introduced virus in the Circoviridae family that causes necrotizing lymphadenitis in pigs, histologically similar to KFD.• We discovered the significantly increased TTV/TTMV viral loads in the KFD patients than normal controls, which implicates TTV/TTMV in the pathogenesis of KFD. © 2019, International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR).

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped DNA virus that its role as a helper or causative agent in hepatitis is still unclear. TTV prevalence varies in different regions of the world. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of TTV in healthy individuals and those infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) living in Yazd city, Iran. Methods: In this case-control study, 50 healthy subjects and 68 HCV-positive individuals who referred to Yazd hospitals participated in this study. TTV DNA in serum samples were detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers of 5?-UTR and N22 regions. The genotypes of HCV and TTV were determined by sequencing method. Results: TTV-DNA was detected in 2 out of 50 (4?) healthy individuals and in 4 out of 68 (5.8?) HCV-positive persons. There was not a significant correlation between the prevalence of TTV and HCV infection. The most common TTV genotypes among HCV-positive individuals were 3, 17 and 13, respectively. There was not a significant association obtained between HCV genotypes and TTV genotypes. Conclusion: The prevalence of TTV in Yazd province was low compared with the other areas of Iran. The prevalence of TTV in HCV infected people was not significantly higher than its rate in uninfected individuals. © 2020 Caspian Journal of Internal Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Egypt ranks first regarding the prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Many patients have concomitant diseases like kidney disorders requiring hemodialysis, a procedure carrying the hazard of transmitting other hepatitis viruses. The purpose of this study was to investigate for occult hepatitis B virus (HBV), SEN virus (SENV), and torque teno virus (TTV) among chronic HCV patients on maintenance hemodialysis to identify their impacts. Methods: A total of 325 hemodialysis patients were enrolled and divided into two groups based on HCV RNA testing results. Blood samples were collected before hemodialysis. Sera were tested for hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc) and hepatitis B surface antibodies (anti-HBs) using ELISA. HBV, SENV, and TTV DNA were detected by PCR. The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was measured. Results: Anti-HBc and HBV DNA were detected in 73.1% and 50.8% of group 1 versus 36.4% and 22.6% of group 2. The serum ALT level was higher in group 1 than group 2. SENV was detected in 11.5% of group 1 versus 8.2% of group 2. TTV was detected in 29% of group 1 versus 27% of group 2. Conclusions: There is an increased prevalence of occult HBV in our locality among chronic HCV patients undergoing hemodialysis. The existence of SENV and TTV viremia has no clinical impact. © 2019 The Author(s)

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV), torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) are members of the family Anelloviridae that are known to infect humans. Although no pathogenic roles have been associated with anelloviruses, their high prevalence and perceived ubiquitousness have provoked scientific interest in understanding their molecular and biological characteristics. We used nested PCR to determine the prevalence of anelloviruses among 130 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients and 130 healthy blood donors, and analyzed three near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates from HIV-infected and non-HIV infected Nigerians. Statistical analysis showed that the rate of TTV infection was significantly higher in the HIV-infected group (65%) than in the blood donor group (26%) (p &lt; 0.05, χ2 = 40.3). TTMV and TTMDV infections were very high in both groups, ranging between 88 and 95%. No significant association was found between TTV infection and age, sex, CD4+ cell count, HIV viral load or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. Near-full-length genome sequences of TTV isolates FL100, FL08 and BD67 determined by next-generation sequencing were 3.6 kb, 3.2 kb and 2.9 kb, respectively, in size. Their GenBank accession numbers are MK820644, MK820645, MK820646, respectively. These isolates shared 59% sequence identity across the whole genome and clustered in two different phylogenetic groups. Our study established for the first time the circulation of TTV, TTMV and TTMDV in the Nigerian population, with a disproportionately higher prevalence of TTV in HIV-infected patients. The near-complete TTV genome sequences from Nigeria are similar to the sequences KT163879 and KT163916 (3748 and 3190 respectively), obtained from the plasma of HIV-infected subjects from the United States, and EU305675 (2919), identified in human plasma samples from France. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Objective: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a highly prevalent non-pathogenic anellovirus whose plasma levels may be a biomarker of immunosuppression. The aim of this study was to assess whether specific immune-targeting with different biologic drugs may differentially modulate TTV viremia in arthritis patients. Methods: TTV DNA load was quantified by PCR in a cross-sectional sample of 79 patients with chronic arthritis on biologic therapy (abatacept, infliximab, rituximab or tocilizumab), 31 patients treated with conventional DMARDs (methotrexate and/or leflunomide), and 54 healthy individuals. Longitudinal changes in TTV load were analysed in a second group of 59 patients at baseline and 4-months after biologic therapy. Correlations between clinical or biological characteristics of recruited patients and TTV viremia were also analysed. Results: In the cross-sectional study, TTV load was significantly higher in patients who received abatacept, infliximab or tocilizumab compared to healthy individuals. Patients treated with rituximab or conventional DMARDs showed TTV loads similar to healthy controls. In the longitudinal study, an increase in the TTV load was observed after anti-TNF, tocilizumab, abatacept and rituximab, but not after secukinumab therapy. Correlations between TTV load and clinical variables such as disease duration, concomitant glucocorticoid or DMARDs therapy, lymphocytes or previous infections were not found. A non-significant trend towards higher TTV load was observed in therapy responders. Conclusion: Patients with chronic arthritis on biologic but not on conventional DMARD or anti-IL17 therapy have increased TTV viremia. This observation provides a basis to prospectively explore the potential value of TTV load as a potential pharmacodynamic biomarker. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether timing of the initiating event of spontaneous labor (either uterine contractions with intact fetal membranes or rupture of membranes prior to labor (PROM)) is associated with maternal viral infection. It was a prospective case control study of women with either spontaneous labor or PROM occurring < 37 weeks’ gestation (“cases”) or at term (“controls”). An initial unbiased screen for viruses was performed with next-generation sequencing (NGS) in serum pooled from eight cases delivered by C/S and represents a range of gestational ages, membrane rupture status, and presence or absence of chorioamnionitis. Custom PCR was used to query individual patient samples from the original cohort. The NGS screen generated 15 million reads. Seven unique viral sequences were detected in two cases, all identified as torque teno virus (TTV), an ubiquitous DNA anellovirus of no known pathogenicity. Using nested and semi-nested PCR, sera from 72 patients (47 cases and 25 matched controls, stratified by ROM status) were screened for the 3 subtypes of anelloviruses (TTV, TTMDV, or TTMV). These were found in 43/47 cases (91%) and 16/25 controls (64%) (p = 0.012, OR = 5.9 (95% CI = 1.4–29.9)). In logistic regression, pregnant women with at least one type of anellovirus were more likely to experience preterm labor than those with no anellovirus (p = 0.03, aOR = 4.6, CI = 1.2–18.7). Among women experiencing a spontaneous initiating event of labor, TTV virus was more likely to be present in the serum of preterm than term patients. TTV may have a role in determining the timing of parturition. © 2020, Society for Reproductive Investigation.

AB  - Introduction: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-pathogenic anellovirus commonly found in the blood of human beings. Emerging data suggest that TTV viral load is proportional to the degree of immunosuppression, but its seroprevalence is unknown in Australia. We aimed to determine the seroprevalence of TTV in an Australian population of renal patients. Methods: We developed a real-time PCR to measure TTV viral load, using the TaqMan platform and previously published primers and probes. Following ethics approval and informed consent, we collected blood from hemodialysis patients not receiving immunosuppression, and renal transplant patients. All patients were recruited from a single teaching hospital in New South Wales. Results: We enrolled 50 hemodialysis and 30 renal transplant patients. 56 (70%) were males, and the mean (sd) age was 61 (16) years. TTV was detectable in plasma of 40/50 (80%) of hemodialysis patients and 28/30 (93%) of transplant patients. The mean TTV viral load was higher in transplant patients than in dialysis patients (6.3 log versus 5.0 log copies/ml, P =.001). Conclusions: Torque teno virus is prevalent in Australian renal patients and thus may be a useful novel marker to help tailor immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant patients. Further work is needed to establish TTV seroprevalence in other regions and patient groups, and to investigate whether there is correlation with clinically important events (infection and rejection episodes) in longitudinal studies. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Human anelloviruses (Torque Teno Virus (TTV) and TTV Like Mini Virus (TLMV)) are now being reported at a high prevalence across the world, with a controversial disease-inducing potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of these anellovirus in vitreous of patients with presumed infectious endophthalmitis. After informed consent, vitreous fluid from patients with endophthalmitis (n = 103) and non-infectious pathologies (n = 102) were analyzed for the presence of TTV and TLMV DNA by qPCR with the limit of quantification defined as 100 copies per reaction. Among the patients clinically diagnosed with endophthalmitis, 29 of the 40 culture proven samples (72.5%) and 42 out of 63 (66.6%) of culture-negative samples were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV. Interestingly, 51 of the 102 (50%) samples in the control group were also positive for TTV/TLMV. Comparing the clinical outcome among patients diagnosed with endophthalmitis, we observed no significant association in the final visual acuity of patients who were positive for presence of TTV/TLMV, however, these patients had significantly higher repeat antibiotic injections (p = 0.03). Further evidence is however needed to correlate TTV / TLMV with a particular pathology or group of pathologies in the eye. © 2020 Naik et al.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is an unenveloped, circular, single stranded DNA virus with a genome size of approximately 3.8 kb. Previous studies have demonstrated varying grades of association between TTV DNA levels and immune deficiencies related to age, chronic infections and cancer. Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been related to persistent viral infections such as HSV-1 and CMV, but it is not known whether TTV viral load could serve as a functional biomarker of cellular immunity in this setting. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate whether TTV infection and viral load is related to AD status, CMV immunity, systemic inflammation or HLA types connected to anti-viral immunity. A total of 50 AD subjects and 51 non-demented controls were included in the study. AD subjects were diagnosed according to NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-IV criteria and neuroradiologic findings were consistent with the diagnosis. TTV viral load was analyzed in plasma samples using a quantitative real-time PCR. Using a cut-off for TTV status at 200 copies/ml, 88% (89/101) of the study subjects were classified as TTV positive. TTV viral load significantly increased with age (beta 0.049 per year, p<0.001) but significantly decreased in relation to CMV IgG levels (beta -0.022 per 1000 units, p = 0.005) and HLA-B27 positivity (beta -0.53, p = 0.023). In conclusion, TTV immune control is not significantly affected by AD status, but appears related to age, CMV humoral immune response and HLA type. © 2020 Westman et al.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is the most common component of the human blood virobiota. Little is known, however, about the prevalence of TTV in humans and the most common farm domesticates in Jordan, or the history and modality of TTV transmission across species lines. We therefore tested sera from 396 Jordanians and 171 farm animals for the presence of TTV DNA using nested 50-UTR-PCR.We then performed phylogenetic, ordination and evolutionary diversity analyses on detected DNA sequences. We detected a very high prevalence of TTV in Jordanians (∼96%); much higher than in farm animal domesticates (∼29% pooled over species). TTV prevalence in the human participants is not associated with geography, demography or physical attributes. Phylogenetic, ordination and evolutionary diversity analyses indicated that TTV is transmitted readily between humans across the geography of the country and between various species of animal domesticates. However, the majority of animal TTV isolates seem to derive from a single human-to-animal transmission event in the past, and current human-animal transmission in either direction is relatively rare. In conclusion, animal TTV in Jordan is historically derived from human variants; however, ongoing human-animal TTV exchange is minimal and zoonotic infection seems to be of limited importance. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - The viral load of the ubiquitous and nonpathogenic torque teno virus (TTV) is associated with the grade of immunosuppression of its host. The development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) allowed to describe the human virome of the blood compartment in transplanted patients, and showed that TTV is the most important part of the virome. This study is a descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. Descriptive retrospective pilot study of sequencing plasma samples from 15 matched donors and recipients. After sample processing, nucleic acids were amplified by rolling circle amplification and submitted to NGS by ion proton sequencing technology. Results were analyzed after mapping of reads on the 29 TTV reference genomes and de novo assembling of the reads with MIRA software. The number of TTV species present in donors and recipients was, on average, 12 in donors and 33 in recipients. TTV species predominantly present in donors were TTV-13 and TTV-18; and in recipients were TTV-P15-2, TTV-27, TTV-HD14a, and TTV-22. We highlighted a significant variability in abundance and composition in sequential samples from recipients. Temporal evolution of TTV populations was clearly observed in recipients, but no preferential transmission of a species from donor to recipient was evidenced. Diversity and population expansion were observed in kidney recipients. Further study of TTV species could help assess the potential impact of each species of this virus. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC

AB  - Background: Chronic deterioration of kidney graft function is related to inadequate immunosuppression (IS). A novel tool to assess the individual net state of IS in transplanted patients might be the monitoring of Torque teno virus (TTV) viral load. TTV is a non-pathogen virus detectable in almost all individuals. TTV level in the peripheral blood has been linked to the immune-competence of its host and should thus reflect IS after solid organ transplantation. Methods: TTV plasma load was quantified monthly by RT-PCR for a period of 1 year in 45 kidney-transplanted children. Post-transplant time was at least 3 months. The relation of the virus DNA levels to IS and transplant-specific clinical and laboratory parameters was analysed longitudinally. Results: TTV DNA was detectable in 94.5% of the plasma samples. There was a significant association with the post-transplant follow-up time as well as with the type of IS regimen, with lower virus loads in patients after longer post-transplant time and mTOR inhibitor–based IS. Furthermore, a significant positive correlation with the dose of prednisolone and mycophenolate mofetil was found. Conclusions: TTV levels show an association/correlation with the strength of IS. Further studies are needed in order to evaluate TTV measurement as a tool for IS monitoring for hard clinical outcomes such as presence of donor-specific antibodies, rejections or infections—common consequences of insufficient or too intense IS. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Feline oral squamous cell carcinoma (FOSCC) may be the best naturally-occurring model of human head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). HNSCC can be broadly divided into human papillomavirus (HPV)-negative cancers and HPV-positive cancers where HPV is the causative agent. Previous studies in FOSCC have used both species-specific and species-nonspecific PCR primers that may be insensitive to the detection of PVs and other viruses that may be divergent from known sequences. ViroCap is a targeted capture and next generation sequencing tool that was designed to identify all known vertebrate DNA and RNA viruses. In this study we used a metagenomic approach using ViroCap for DNA viruses in 20 FOSCC, 9 normal feline oral mucosal, and 8 suspected PV positive control samples. We tested the hypothesis that viruses would be enriched in FOSCC compared to normal oral mucosa. The virome of the FOSCC and normal feline oral mucosa consisted of feline foamy virus in 7/20 and 2/9 (35% and 22%), feline torque teno virus in 2/20 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), alphaherpesvirus in 2/10 and 0/9 (10% and 0%), FIV (0% and 22%), Epstein-Barr virus in 1/20 and 0/9 (5% and 0%) and feline papillomavirus in 1/20 and 0/9 samples (5% and 0% respectively). Felis catus papillomavirus-3 was found in 1 of 20 FOSCC samples. A virus was not associated consistently with FOSCC. If PVs have a role in FOSCC it is at most a supplementary or uncommon role. FOSCC appears most closely related to HPV-negative HNSCC. Future research on FOSCC should focus on identifying genetic and environmental causes. © 2019

AB  - Interferons are secreted cytokines with potent antiviral, antitumor and immunomodulatory functions. As the first line of defense against viruses, this pathway restricts virus infection and spread. On the contrary, viruses have evolved ingenious strategies to evade host immune responses including the interferon pathway. Multiple families of viruses, in particular, DNA viruses, encode microRNA (miR) that are small, non-protein coding, regulatory RNAs. Virus-derived miRNAs (v-miR) function by targeting host and virus-encoded transcripts and are critical in shaping host-pathogen interaction. The role of v-miRs in viral pathogenesis is emerging as demonstrated by their function in subverting host defense mechanisms and regulating fundamental biological processes such as cell survival, proliferation, modulation of viral life-cycle phase. In this review, we will discuss the role of v-miRs in the suppression of host genes involved in the viral nucleic acid detection, JAK-STAT pathway, and cytokine-mediated antiviral gene activation to favor viral replication and persistence. This information has yielded new insights into our understanding of how v-miRs promote viral evasion of host immunity and likely provide novel antiviral therapeutic targets. © 2020 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Astroviruses (AstVs) are major causative agents of gastroenteritis in children and have been reported in many species. Canine astrovirus (CaAstV), as an enteric pathogen, has been widely detected worldwide, but little is known about their genetic diversity and evolution, partly owing to a lack of genomic data. Here, we sequenced 12 nearly full-length CaAstV genomes to address the gap in knowledge. We found 14 (13.2%) and 7 (3.35%) CaAstV-positive samples from pet dogs with and without diarrhoea, respectively. Co-infections were with co-infection with Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) reported for the first time. Phylogenetic analysis of the ORF2 gene revealed four major lineages. In particular, lineage 4 might have evolved from a recombinant virus from lineage 2 and lineage 3. The strains sequenced here clustered with lineages 2, 3 and 4 in contrast with other Chinese strains identified previously that clustered with lineages 2 and 4. Amino acid sequence alignment within lineage revealed intralineage amino acid diversity and that the type of epidemic strains within lineages changes over time. Three amino acids substitutions located in predicted B-cell epitopes, which might be involved escape of host immunity. Moreover, frequent inter-clade ORF2 gene recombinants were identified. The identification of individual recombination events and a recombinant lineage indicated that recombination plays a crucial role in CaAstV genetic evolution and diversity by generating divergent viruses. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of ORF1b, the most conserved gene of astrovirus, revealed a close relationship between CaAstV and California sea lion astroviruses. Overall, we report detailed information on the genetic evolution and diversity of CaAstV, which indicates that CaAstV may pose challenges for diagnostics and future control strategies. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) in peripheral pulmonary infection management by comparing the diagnostic yield of mNGS and traditional pathogen detection methods on interventional specimens obtained by bronchoscopy. Patients and Methods: This study enrolled patients suspected with pulmonary infection who were admitted to Tianjin Medical University General Hospital from June 2018 to August 2019. Specimens were obtained from bronchoscopy for mNGS analysis and traditional pathogen detection (including bronchoalveolar lavage fluid microbial culture, smear microscopy, and lung biopsy histopathology), and the diagnostic yields were compared between mNGS and traditional methods to evaluate the diagnostic value of mNGS in peripheral pulmonary infection diagnosis. Results: In this study, by comparing mNGS with traditional pathogen detection, the results indicated that, first, mNGS identified at least one microbial species in almost 89% of the patients with pulmonary infection; second, mNGS detected microbes related to human diseases in 94.49% of samples from pulmonary infection patients who had received negative results from traditional pathogen detection; third, the accuracy and sensitivity of mNGS are higher than those of traditional pathogen detection; and, finally, mNGS could simultaneously detect and identify a large variety of pathogens. Conclusion: Metagenomic NGS analysis provided fast and precise pathogen detection and identification, contributing to prompt and accurate treatment of peripheral pulmonary infection. © 2020 Huang et al.

AB  - Platelet transfusion is a common practice in onco-hematologic patients for preventing or treating hemorrhages. Platelet concentrates can be transfused with therapeutic or prophylactic purposes. With the aim to help clinicians to take the decisions on platelet transfusion, some guidelines have been developed based on the current scientific evidence. However, there are some controversial issues and available scientific evidence is not enough to solve them. There is little information about what is the best platelet product to be transfused: random platelets or single donor apheresis platelets, and plasma-suspended or additive solution suspended platelets. Platelets are often transfused without respecting the ABO compatibility, but influence of this practice on platelet transfusion outcome is not well established. In the prophylactic platelet transfusion set there are some questions unsolved as the platelet threshold to transfuse prior to specific procedures or surgery, and even if platelet transfusion is necessary for some specific procedures as autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. A challenging complication raised from multiple platelet transfusions is the platelet transfusion refractoriness. The study and management of this complication is often disappointing. In summary, although it is a widespread practice, platelet transfusion has still many controversial and unknown issues. The objective of this article is to review the current evidence on platelet transfusion practices, focusing on the controversial issues and challenges. © 2020 Solves Alcaina. T.

AB  - Although porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is an economically important pathogen of swine, there is a lack of information on PCV2 from the Lesser Antilles. In this retrospective study, we report high rates of detection of PCV2 DNA in porcine faecal (41.3%, 26/63) and kidney (32.8%, 20/61) samples from the Lesser Antilles island of St. Kitts. Most of the PCV2-positive faecal samples were from diarrhoeic piglets (23/26), with 15 animals exhibiting stunted growth and/or weight loss. Although the PCV2-positive kidneys were from slaughter age, clinically healthy pigs, microscopically, various degrees of inflammation (mild, moderate or severe) were observed in 18 kidneys. Rotavirus-A, porcine parvovirus and torque teno sus virus were detected in 2, 4 and 14 PCV2-positive samples, respectively. The complete genomes of 18 St. Kitts PCV2 strains were amplified using three overlapping nested PCR assays designed in the present study. By phylogenetic analysis of PCV2 open reading frame 2 (ORF2) and complete genomes, 15 St. Kitts strains were assigned to genotype PCV2b. The remaining three PCV2 strains were identified as PCV2b-PCV2d recombinants, with the involvement of ORF2 in two of the strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report on detection and genotyping of PCV2 strains from the Lesser Antilles. Considering the significant contributions of pig farming to the regional livestock economy and increasing demand for local pork in the Lesser Antilles, our findings emphasize the importance of future studies on surveillance and genotyping of PCV2 in other Caribbean islands of the region. © 2020 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Aims: Kawasaki disease is an acute pediatric vasculitis whose etiology remains unknown but epidemiology and clinical presentation suggest a viral etiology. We performed unbiased high-throughput-sequencing on blood of patients with Kawasaki Disease (KD). Materials and Methods: High-throughput-sequencing was performed directly on blood of children with typical KD. Sequences were aligned against a database of clinically relevant viruses. Results: Four patients were acutely infected in the blood, with respectively, poliovirus (vaccine strain), measles (vaccine strain), rhinovirus and bocavirus. Patients with poliovirus and measles had received oral polio and measles vaccines, respectively, twelve and 2 weeks prior. Conclusion: Viral signatures were identified in more than half of the patients, including some corresponding to their vaccinal history. This could suggest a temporal association with KD. © Copyright © 2019 L'Huillier, Brito, Wagner, Cordey, Zdobnov, Posfay-Barbe and Kaiser.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus which is predominantly transmitted by the fecal-oral route and may be excreted in the absence of the clinical symptoms. TTV was previously considered a probable cause of hepatitis, but further studies could not strongly connect TTV to any serious health problem. TTV is highly resistant to water and wastewater treatment processes and can be a useful indicator for determining the fecal contamination of water. The purpose of the present study was to assess the prevalence and molecular characterization of TTV in treated wastewater in Tehran. Thirteen effluent samples were collected monthly from the biggest wastewater treatment plant in Tehran, Iran (from September 2017 to August 2018). The presence of the TTV was monitored in the samples by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The TTV genome was found in 76.9% of the samples, and TTV of groups 1 and 3 were determined using phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, treated wastewater can play a key role in the transmission of TTV and the usage of treated wastewater as a source of potable water needs to be carefully controlled. © IWA Publishing 2019.

AB  - Purpose of Review: In this review, we present the overview of emerging and neglected viruses associated with liver involvement. Recent Findings: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) emerged in the last two decades, causing hepatitis in many parts of the world. Moreover, liver involvement was also described in some emerging arboviral infections. Many reports showed dengue-associated liver injury; however, chikungunya, West Nile, tick-borne encephalitis, and Zika virus are rarely associated with clinically manifest liver disease. In addition, some neglected highly prevalent viruses such as adenoviruses and parvovirus B19 are capable of causing hepatitis in specific population groups. Anelloviruses (torque teno virus/torque teno mini virus/torque teno midi virus, SEN virus), human bocavirus, pegiviruses, and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus have shown a little potential for causing hepatitis, but their role in the etiology of liver disease remains to be determined. Summary: In addition to the well-known hepatotropic viruses, many emerging and neglected viruses have been associated with liver diseases. The number of emerging zoonotic viruses has been increasingly recognized. While zoonotic potential of HEV is well documented, the recent identification of new hepatitis-related animal viruses such as HEV strains from rabbits and camels, non-primate hepaciviruses in domestic dogs and horses, as well as equine and porcine pegivirus highlights the possible zoonotic transmission in the context of “One Health.” However, zoonotic potential and hepatotropism of animal hepatitis viruses remain to be determined. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The cause of acute encephalitis/meningoencephalitis in pediatric patients remains often unexplained despite extensive investigations for large panel of pathogens. To explore a possible viral implication, we investigated the virome of cerebrospinal fluid specimens of 70 febrile pediatric inpatients with clinical compatible encephalitis/meningoencephalitis. Using viral metagenomics, we detected and genetically characterized three novel human Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) species (TTMV-G1-3). Phylogenetically, TTMV-G1-3 clustered in three novel monophyletic lineages within genus Betatorquevirus of the Anelloviridae family. TTMV-G1-3 were highly prevalent in diseased children, but absent in the healthy cohort which may indicate an association of TTMV species with febrile illness. With 2/3 detected malaria co-infection, it remains unclear if these novel anellovirus species are causative agents or increase disease severity by interaction with malaria parasites. The presence of the viruses 28 days after initiating antimalarial and/or antibiotic treatment suggests a still active viral infection likely as effect of parasitic and/or bacterial co-infection that may have initiated a modulated immune system environment for viral replication or a defective virus clearance. This study increases the current knowledge on the genetic diversity of TTMV and strengthens that human anelloviruses can be considered as biomarkers for strong perturbations of the immune system in certain pathological conditions. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Cell death is a tightly regulated process which can be exploited in cancer treatment to drive the killing of the tumour. Several conventional cancer therapies including chemotherapeutic agents target pathways involved in cell death, yet they often fail due to the lack of selectivity they have for tumour cells over healthy cells. Over the past decade, research has demonstrated the existence of numerous proteins which have an intrinsic tumour-specific toxicity, several of which originate from viruses. These tumour-selective viral proteins, although from distinct backgrounds, have several similar and interesting properties. Though the mechanism(s) of action of these proteins are not fully understood, it is possible that they can manipulate several cell death modes in cancer exemplifying the intricate interplay between these pathways. This review will discuss our current knowledge on the topic and outstanding questions, as well as deliberate the potential for viral proteins to progress into the clinic as successful cancer therapeutics. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Recurrent acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) affect a large population, yet the specific decisive factors are largely unknown. Here we study a population of 4407 children diagnosed with ARTI, comparing respiratory virome and serum cytokine profiles associated with multiple ARTIs and single ARTI during a six-year period. The relative abundance of Propionibacterium phages is significantly elevated in multiple ARTIs compared to single ARTI group. Serum levels of TIMP-1 and PDGF-BB are markedly increased in multiple ARTIs compared to single-ARTI and non-ARTI controls, making these two cytokines potential predictors for multiple ARTIs. The presence of Propionibacterium phages is associated with higher levels of TIMP-1 and PDGF-BB. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses show that the combination of TIMP-1, PDGF-BB and Propionibacterium phages could be a strong predictor for multiple ARTIs. These findings indicate that respiratory microbe homeostasis and specific cytokines are associated with the onset of multiple ARTIs over time. © 2019, The Author(s).

AB  - Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at increased risk of infection with blood-borne viruses, especially hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and Torque teno virus (TTV). The present study investigated these issues and the possibility of nosocomial transmission among patients undergoing hemodialysis.A cross sectional study was carried out on80 patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis (HD) and 20 blood donors as control who admitted to blood bank for blood donationwere enrolled in this study in Kirkuk provincefrom 15th of August 2018 to 15th of February 2019. Result: The prevalence of TTV DNA was detected in those TTV Ag seropositive and some seronegative dialysis patients,genetic analysis was done using the primers from N22 region of TTV. The study showed that 15% of HD patients had TTV DNA.The study showed that the highest rate of TTV infection (30%) was found in patients under dialysis for more than 3 years. On the other hand,the study displayed that the highest rates of TTV infections were recorded in HD patients who previously received blood for more than 6 time (58.33%). The current study revealed that there was no significant association between TTV infection and level of ALT and ASTin HD patients. © 2019, Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus-induced aseptic meningitis has not been documented, although torque teno virus infections still remain under consideration for etiological agents. This study identified a torque teno virus sequence using next generation sequencing and immunoglobulin M response to the torque teno virus antigen, therefore, that would be a comprehensive diagnosis for torque teno virus infection. Case presentation: A 2-month-old Japanese boy was brought to our hospital because he was irritable, drowsy, and lethargic. He was admitted based on his test results which indicated the possibility of septic meningitis. He was started on treatment with high-dose antibiotics and steroids. On the third day of hospitalization, he became afebrile with improvement in his general status and was discharged on the sixth day. He had no developmental problems for up to 1 year after discharge. Metagenomic ribonucleic acid-Seq pathogen detection using next generation sequencing of a sample of his cerebrospinal fluid, which was collected at admission, revealed three short reads homologous to those in torque teno virus out of a total of 1,708,516 reads. This finding indicated that our patient was positive compared to the torque teno virus-negative cerebrospinal fluid samples (controls) from 13 other patients. The torque teno virus has been shown to have a whole genome sequence of 2810 nt by polymerase chain reaction. We prepared a recombinant GP2 antigen from torque teno virus and used it to study our patient's anti-Torque teno virus immune response. An anti-GP2 serum immunoglobulin M response was detected, providing further supportive evidence of torque teno virus infection. Conclusions: This case speculates that torque teno virus-induced aseptic meningitis has a good course. New technologies like next generation sequencing can help in the identification of such cases, and an accumulation of future cases is expected. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - A new member of Anelloviridae, named torque teno mini virus (TTMV)-SH, was recently identified in the serum of three Hodgkin’s lymphoma patients suggesting that TTMV-SH may be associated with this type of hematological malignancy. We investigated by metagenomic analysis the presence of TTMV-SH-related viruses in plasma samples (n = 323) collected from patients with various hematological malignancies (multiple myeloma (MM, n = 256), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL, n = 20), acute myeloid leukemia (n = 10)) and from healthy donors (n = 37). TTMV-SH-related strains were identified in 24 samples corresponding to four MM and one NHL patients. Phylogenic analysis revealed that the 24 isolates were close to the TTMV-SH strains previously identified, sharing 79.6–86.7% ORF1 nucleotide sequence identity. These results suggest that TTMV-SH-related viruses might be found in hematological diseases other than Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Due to the high genetic variability within Anelloviridae species, the association between a particular medical condition and a new genotype should be interpreted with caution. © Copyright © 2019 Bal, Oriol, Josset, Generenaz, Sarkozy, Sesques, Salles, Morfin, Lina, Becker, Reynier, Mallet, Pachot, Cheynet, Brengel-Pesce and Trouillet-Assant.

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in immunosuppressed patients can cause considerable morbidity and mortality. The aim of our study was to evaluate factors associated with acute liver failure (ALF) in HBV reactivation. Clinical, laboratory, and virological data of 87 patients with HBV reactivation were analyzed retrospectively. Teno torque virus (TTV) plasma loads were measured as a measure of immune competence. HBV genomes isolated from 47 patients were analyzed by next-generation sequencing. A functional analysis of identified HBsAg mutants was performed. In patients with ALF the diagnosis was significantly later confirmed than in the non-ALF group. Patients diagnosed during immunosuppression had a milder clinical course compared to later diagnosed patients (p = 0.018, OR = 4.17). TTV viral loads did not differ significantly between the two groups. The HBV genomes isolated from ALF patients had higher viral complexity. A mutation in C-region of HBsAg (L216*), was associated with reduced HBsAg production and secretion. Patients diagnosed with HBV reactivation during immunosuppression had a milder clinical course compared to patients diagnosed during immune reconstitution. ALF was associated with higher viral complexity. An HBsAg mutation (L216*) was found to be more frequent in ALF patients and was associated with reduced HBsAg production and secretion. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Solid organ transplantation (SOT) recipients receive immunosuppressive therapy to avoid rejection of the transplanted organ. Immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of infections. However, no existing marker reliably reveals the status of the immune function in SOT recipients. Torque-Teno virus or Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) has gained attention as a possible endogenous marker of the immune function. TTV is a non-enveloped, circular single strand DNA virus, and it may be considered a part of the human virome. In a bidirectional relationship, the immune system detects TTV and TTV may also modulate the activity of immune system. These characteristics have made the virus a possible candidate indicator of immune function. In this systematic review, we describe the role and potential function of TTV viral load as an endogenous marker of the immune function and consequently the level of immune suppression in SOT recipients. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - Background: Assessment of the intensity of immunosuppression in transplant recipients to estimate the risk of rejection and infection is not entirely satisfactory at the present time. Determination of Torque teno virus (TTV) viral load appears to be a promising tool in this setting. Objectives: We evaluated the level of replication and kinetics of TTV during the first three months after kidney transplantation compared to BK virus replication. Results: In a retrospective cohort of 116 renal transplant recipients, TTV viral load gradually increased during the first three months post-transplantation with no significant difference or discriminatory threshold between patients with and without BK virus replication. However, the level of TTV replication appeared to be indirectly related to the risk of BK virus replication, particularly according to the induction treatment used (antithymocyte globulin: ATG or basiliximab). Among patients receiving ATG, those receiving cyclosporine had significantly lower TTV viral loads (p &lt; 0.01) with threefold lower reactivation of BKPyV (13 vs 37%) 3 months post-transplantation. Similarly, among the women in our cohort, TTV viral load was significantly higher in women receiving ATG (6.58 ± 1.57 versus 4.62 ± 2.0 log 10 copies/mL for basiliximab: p &lt; 0.01), also with threefold higher BKPyV reactivation frequencies (40 vs 13,3%). Conclusion: The multiparametric variation of TTV viral load does not appear to be individually appropriate for the early detection or monitoring of possible post-transplant BKPyV virus reactivation in renal transplant recipients. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objectives: New biomarkers reflecting the degree of immunosuppression in transplant recipients are needed to provide an optimal personalized balance between rejection and infection risks. Methods: For this purpose, we investigated TTV viremia dynamics in 66 kidney transplant recipients followed up for two years after transplantation, in relation to BK virus infection and graft rejection. Results: After transplantation, TTV viremia rose by ≥2 log10 copies/mL from baseline to month 3, then declined by ≥1 log10 copies/mL thereafter. Higher TTV viremia was associated with recipients of a deceased donor, a lower count of CD8+ T cells and a higher BKV viremia. Importantly, TTV loads were significantly lower in KTR who would later display graft rejection; indeed, patients with TTV viremia lower than 3.4 log10 copies/mL at transplantation or lower than 4.2 log10 copies/mL at month 1 had a higher risk of developing graft rejection in the two following years (hazard ratio (HR) at D0 = 7.30, p = 0.0007 and HR at M1 = 6.16, p = 0.001). Conclusions: TTV viremia measurement at early times post transplantation predicts graft rejection and would represent a useful tool to improve kidney transplant monitoring. © 2019 The British Infection Association

AB  - The torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is an emerging virus threating the Suidae species of unclear pathogenicity, although it was previously reported as a worsening factor of other porcine diseases, in particular, porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD). Here, a comprehensive codon usage analysis of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1), which encodes the viral capsid protein, was undertaken for the first time to reveal its evolutionary history. We revealed independent phylogenetic processes for the two genera during TTSuV evolution, which was confirmed by principal component analysis (PCA). A low codon usage bias was observed in different genera and different species, with Kappatorquevirus a (TTSuVk2a) displaying the highest, which was mainly driven by mutation pressure and natural selection, especially natural selection. Overall, ATs were more abundant than GCs, along with more A-ended synonymous codons in relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) analysis. To further confirm the role of natural selection and TTSuV adaptation to the Suidae species, codon adaptation index (CAI), relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI), and similarity index (SiD) analyses were performed, which showed different adaptations for different TTSuVs. Importantly, we identified a more dominant role of Sus scrofa in the evolution of Iotatorquevirus (TTSuV1), with the highest CAI values and lowest RCDI values compared to Sus scrofa domestica. However, in TTSuVk2, the roles of Sus scrofa and Sus scrofa domestica were the same, regarding codon usage, with similar CAI and RCDI values. Our study provides a new perspective of the evolution of TTSuV and valuable information to develop control measures against TTSuV. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Objective: To investigate a possible role of torque teno virus (TTV) in the etiology of sarcoidosis Design: Controlled prospective study Setting: Faculty of Meram Medicine, Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey Subjects: This cross-sectional, clinical study included 37 sarcoidosis patients and 9 healthy control patients. Intervention: TTV DNA quantification was performed by real-time PCR by the hybridization probe system, and viral load was interpreted by means of the crossing point (CP) value in sera of subjects. Main outcome measures: The prevalence and viral load of TTV Results: TTV DNA was detected in the majority of both patients and healthy controls. The prevalence was 59.5% in patients and 55.6% in controls. This difference was not statistically significant. However, CP values were statistically different in the patient group from the control group (p <0.001); namely, the viral load of TTV was higher in the patient group than in the healthy control group. Conclusions: Overall, these findings demonstrate for the first time that TTV plays a role in the etiology of sarcoidosis. It is likely that the role of TTV in the pathogenesis of sarcoidosis is an aberrant immune response, driven by viral antigens. © 2019, Kuwait Medical Association. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background. Drug-induced immunosuppression in kidney transplant recipients is crucial to prevent allograft rejection, but increases risk for infectious disease. Immunologic monitoring to tailor immunosuppressive drugs might prevent alloreactivity and adverse effects simultaneously. The apathogenic torque teno virus (TTV) reflects the immunocompetence of its host and might act as a potential candidate for a holistic monitoring. Methods. We screened all 1010 consecutive patients from the prospective Vienna Kidney Transplant Cohort Study for availability of allograft biopsies and adequately stored sera for TTV quantification by polymerase chain reaction. Results. Patients with acute biopsy-proven alloreactivity according to the Banff classification (n = 33) showed lower levels of TTV in the peripheral blood compared to patients without rejection (n = 80) at a median of 43 days before the biopsy. The risk for alloreactivity decreased by 10% per log level of TTV copies/mL (risk ratio,.90 [95% confidence interval,.84-.97]; P =.005). TTV levels &gt;1 × 106 copies/mL exclude rejection with a sensitivity of 94%. Multivariable generalized linear modeling suggests an independent association between TTV level and alloreactivity. Conclusions. TTV is a prospective biomarker for risk stratification of acute biopsy-proven alloreactivity in kidney transplant recipients and might be a potential tool to tailor immunosuppressive drug therapy. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Hepatitis B virus (HBV) is an enveloped partial double-stranded DNA virus that can cause acute and chronic hepatitis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 257 million people are living with HBV. Moreover, 20,900 acute hepatitis B cases were reported in 2016. Hepatitis B is highly prevalent in the African, Western Pacific, Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and European regions, respectively. Due to the high mutational rate of HBV and lack of reverse transcriptase proofreading activity, ten different genotypes with different geographical distributions have been identified. HBV pathogenesis and severity of infection depend on several host and viral factors, particularly, the genetic variability of both the host and virus. Although HBV infection is a global health concern, there is a lack of adequate studies and reports in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. Here, we provide a review on HBV epidemiology, pathogenesis, host–pathogen interactions, coinfection with selected viruses, and laboratory diagnosis, focusing on studies conducted in the MENA region to determine the current situation of the HBV infection and outline the future study areas. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Despite consistent efforts to protect public health there is still a heavy burden of viral disease, both in the United States and abroad. In addition to conventional medical treatment, there is a need for a holistic approach for early detection and prevention of viral outbreaks at a population level. One-Health is a relatively new integrative approach to the solving of global health challenges. A key component to the One-Health approach is the notion that human health, animal health, and environmental health are all innately interrelated. One-Health interventions, initiated by veterinary doctors, have proven to be effective in controlling outbreaks, but thus far the applications focus on zoonotic viruses transmitted from animals to humans. Environmental engineers and environmental scientists hold a critical role in the further development of One-Health approaches that include water-related transport and transmission of human, animal, and zoonotic viruses. In addition to waterborne viruses, the proposed approach is applicable to a wide range of viruses that are found in human excrement since contaminated water-based surveillance systems may be used for early detection of viral disease. This paper proposes a greater One-Health based framework that involves water-related pathways. The first step in the proposed framework is the identification of critical exposure pathways of viruses in the water environment. Identification of critical pathways informs the second and third steps, which include water-based surveillance systems for early detection at a population level and implementation of intervention approaches to block the critical pathways of exposure. © 2019 The Authors

AB  - The interaction between pedestrians and right-turning vehicles at a signalized intersection is a usual scenario in urban locations in which both have to share a common space on the road. Due to the rapid growth of vehicular traffic in developing countries such as India, pedestrian-vehicle conflicts are increasing tremendously. This study evaluated pedestrian safety by examining the interaction between pedestrians and right-turning traffic (left-hand driving) at signalized intersections using the traffic conflict technique. Five time-based conflict indicators, namely postencroachment time (PET), time to vehicle (TTV), deceleration to safety time of pedestrians (DSTped), time to accident (TTA), and deceleration to safety time of vehicles (DSTveh) were used to analyze the conflict situation. Four signalized intersections were selected in two cities (Kolkata and New Delhi) of India. For every possible conflict situation, PET, TTV, DSTped, TTA, and DSTveh were estimated and the severity of conflicts was identified based on pedestrian demography and their crossing behavior. The k-means clustering technique was used to classify the conflict indicators into four levels of severity. Silhouette plots were developed to validate the clusters. A binary logistic regression model was developed to identify significant contributing factors to the risk-taking behavior of pedestrians. The model's results showed that pedestrians' age, gender, waiting time, and speed; type of crossing; pedestrian with company; the occurrence of conflicts in different quarters of the green interval; and right-turning vehicle volume have a significant effect on the risk-taking behavior of pedestrians. The findings of this study may help to identify various factors that affect pedestrian-vehicle conflicts at signalized intersections. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.

AB  - Background. Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option in end-stage lung diseases; however, survival after transplantation is limited by acute and chronic rejection or infectious events being results of inappropriate immunosuppression. Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs) are ubiquitous DNA viruses in humans but not found to be causative for any disease. However, some reports suggest that TTV-DNA levels reflect the grade of immunosuppression with higher levels being found in more immunosuppressed individuals. Methods. We investigated the TTV-DNA levels in 34 lung transplant recipients within their first year after transplantation by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Clinical data were extracted from charts. Results. In accordance with previous results TTV-DNA levels increase after lung transplantation reaching a steady state after 3 months. The TTV-DNA levels were not correlated with immunosuppressive trough levels and a selective increase was not observed with other DNA viruses. In steady state TTV-DNA levels were significantly higher in patients with infectious complications compared to the group of patients without. Additionally, TTV-DNA levels decreased significantly before biopsy-proven rejection. Sensitivity of a 10-fold decrease in TTV-DNA levels for a subsequent rejection episode was 0.74 with a specificity of 0.99. Conclusions. In summary, TTV-DNA might be used as an additional tool to monitor immunosuppression in lung transplant recipients. Higher TTV-DNA levels reflect more intense immunosuppression, whereas the TTV-DNA kinetic (ie, decrease of TTV-DNA levels) indicate rejection. ©2018 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) plasma DNA load has been consistently shown to be a surrogate biomarker of immunosuppression in solid organ transplant recipients. It is uncertain whether it may behave similarly in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (allo-HSCT). Here, we characterized the dynamics of TTV DNAemia in patients undergoing T-cell replete allo-SCT at late times after transplantation (&gt; day + 100). This retrospective single-center observational study included 33 allo-HSCT patients. Plasma TTV DNA loads were quantified by real-time PCR before initiating the conditioning regimen and at different time points after transplant. Absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were measured by flow cytometry. Overall, TTV DNA load increased steadily after engraftment, reaching a peak by day + 90; afterwards, it remained relatively constant until day + 210. TTV DNA loads measured within days + 120 and + 210 correlated inversely with paired ALC, while both parameters did correlate directly within days + 20 and + 60. The median TTV DNA area under a curve between days + 90 and + 210 [(AUC) 90–210 ] was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroids within this time frame for treatment of graft versus host disease (either acute, chronic or both) than in controls (P = 0.025). In summary, TTV DNA load may mirror the degree of immunosuppression at late times after allo-HSCT. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The replication kinetics of nonpathogenic anelloviruses belonging to the Alphatorquevirus genus (such as torque teno virus) might reflect the overall state of posttransplant immunosuppression. We analyzed 221 kidney transplant (KT) recipients in whom plasma alphatorquevirus DNA load was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction at baseline and regularly through the first 12 posttransplant months. Study outcomes included posttransplant infection and a composite of opportunistic infection and/or de novo malignancy (immunosuppression-related adverse event [iRAE]). Alphatorquevirus DNA loads at month 1 were higher among patients who subsequently developed posttransplant infection (P =.023) or iRAE (P =.009). Likewise, those with iRAE beyond months 3 and 6 also exhibited higher peak viral loads over the preceding periods. Areas under the curve for log 10 alphatorquevirus DNAemia estimated by months 1 or 6 were significantly higher in patients experiencing study outcomes. Alphatorquevirus DNA loads above 3.15 and 4.56 log 10 copies/mL at month 1 predicted the occurrence of posttransplant infection (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]: 2.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-7.36; P =.027) and iRAE (aHR: 5.17; 95% CI: 2.01-13.33; P =.001). In conclusion, posttransplant monitoring of plasma alphatorquevirus DNA kinetics may be useful to identify KT recipients at increased risk of immunosuppression-related complications. © 2018 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons

AB  - Despite improvements in graft survival, solid organ transplantation is still associated with considerable infection induced morbidity and mortality. If we were able to show that serious infection risk was associated with excessive suppression of immune capacity, we would be justified in “personalizing” the extent of immunosuppression by carefully monitored reduction to see if we can improve immune compromize without increasing the risk of rejection. Reliable biomarkers are needed to identify this patients at an increased risk of infection. This review focuses on the currently available evidence in solid organ transplant recipients for immune non-pathogen specific biomarkers to predict severe infections with the susceptibility to particular pathogens according to the component of the immune system that is suppressed. This review is categorized into immune biomarkers representative of the humoral, cellular, phagocytic, natural killer cell and complement system. Biomarkers humoral and cellular systems of the that have demonstrated an association with infections include immunoglobulins, lymphocyte number, lymphocyte subsets, intracellular concentrations of adenosine triphosphate in stimulated CD4 + cells and soluble CD30. Biomarkers of the innate immune system that have demonstrated an association with infections include natural killer cell numbers, complement and mannose binding lectin. Emerging evidence shows that quantification of viral nucleic acid (such as Epstein Barr Virus) can act as a biomarker to predict all-cause infections. Studies that show the most promise are those in which several immune biomarkers are assessed in combination. Ongoing research is required to validate non-pathogen specific immune biomarkers in multi-centre studies using standardized study designs. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), 50%-80% of which are strongly associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), carry a high morbidity and mortality. Most clinical/epidemiological/tumor characteristics do not consistently associate with worse patient survival, so our aim was to identify if other viral genomic characteristics associated better with survival. We extracted DNA from stored paraffin-embedded PTLD tissues at our center, identified viral sequences by metagenomic shotgun sequencing (MSS), and analyzed the data in relation to clinical outcomes. Our study population comprised 69 PTLD tissue samples collected between 1991 and 2015 from 60 subjects. Nucleotide sequences from at least one virus were detected by MSS in 86% (59/69) of the tissues (EBV in 61%, anelloviruses 52%, gammapapillomaviruses 14%, CMV 7%, and HSV in 3%). No viruses were present in higher proportion in EBV-negative PTLD (compared to EBV-positive PTLD). In univariable analysis, death within 5 years of PTLD diagnosis was associated with anellovirus (P = 0.037) and gammapapillomavirus (P = 0.036) detection by MSS, higher tissue qPCR levels of the predominant human anellovirus species torque teno virus (TTV; P = 0.016), T cell type PTLD, liver, brain or bone marrow location. In multivariable analyses, T cell PTLD (P = 0.006) and TTV PCR level (P = 0.012) remained significant. In EBV-positive PTLD, EBNA-LP, EBNA1 and EBNA3C had significantly higher levels of nonsynonymous gene variants compared to the other EBV genes. Multiple viruses are detectable in PTLD tissues by MSS. Anellovirus positivity, not EBV positivity,was associated with worse patient survival in our series. Confirmation and extension of this work in larger multicenter studies is desirable. © 2019 The Authors. Cancer Medicine published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The development of noninvasive biomarkers that reflect the state of immunosuppression (IS) remains an unmet need in liver transplantation (LT). Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a highly prevalent, nonpathogenic DNA virus whose plasma levels may be associated with the immune status of the host. The aim of this study was to assess the role of TTV as a biomarker of IS in LT recipients. TTV DNA in plasma was quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction at different time points during the first year after transplant in a prospectively followed cohort of 63 de novo LT recipients, and any correlation between TTV DNA and biopsy-proven acute cellular rejection (ACR) and opportunistic infections was then evaluated. In addition, TTV DNA was studied in 10 longterm LT recipients in monotherapy with tacrolimus, 10 tolerant recipients, and 10 healthy controls. TTV was detected in the plasma of all patients. Among the 63 LT recipients, 20 episodes of ACR were diagnosed, and there were 28 opportunistic infections, 26 of them being cytomegalovirus (CMV) infections. TTV viremia was significantly lower during ACR (4.41 versus 5.95 log 10 copies/mL; P = 0.002) and significantly higher during CMV infections (5.79 versus 6.59 log 10 copies/mL; P = 0.009). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of TTV viral load for the diagnosis of moderate ACR was 0.869, with a sensitivity and negative predictive value of 100%, respectively, for a cutoff point of 4.75 log 10 copies/mL. There were no statistically significant differences in TTV DNA in either longterm or tolerant patients and healthy controls. In conclusion, plasma TTV DNA levels are associated with immune-related events after LT and could constitute a potential biomarker of the state of IS during the first months after transplant.

AB  - Porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) is the etiological agent that causes porcine circovirus diseases and porcine circovirus-associated diseases (PCVD/PCVAD), which are present in every major swine-producing country in the world. PCV2 infections may downregulate the host immune system and enhance the infection and replication of other pathogens. However, the exact mechanisms of PCVD/PCVAD are currently unknown. To date, many studies have reported that several cofactors, such as other swine viruses or bacteria, vaccination failure, and stress or crowding, in combination with PCV2, lead to PCVD/PCVAD. Among these cofactors, co-infection of PCV2 with other viruses, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine parvovirus, swine influenza virus and classical swine fever virus have been widely studied for decades. In this review, we focus on the current state of knowledge regarding swine co-infection with different PCV2 genotypes or strains, as well as with PCV2 and other swine viruses. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Late antibody-mediated rejection (ABMR) triggered by donor-specific antibodies (DSA) is a cardinal cause of kidney allograft dysfunction and loss. Diagnostic criteria for this rejection type are well established, but effective treatment remains a major challenge. Recent randomized controlled trials (RCT) have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of widely used therapies, such as rituximab plus intravenous immunoglobulin or proteasome inhibition (bortezomib), reinforcing a great need for new therapeutic concepts. One promising target in this context may be interleukin-6 (IL-6), a pleiotropic cytokine known to play an important role in inflammation and adaptive immunity. Methods: This investigator-driven RCT was designed to assess the safety and efficacy of clazakizumab, a genetically engineered humanized monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6. The study will include 20 DSA-positive kidney allograft recipients diagnosed with ABMR ≥ 365 days after transplantation. Participants will be recruited at two study sites in Austria and Germany (Medical University of Vienna; Charité University Medicine Berlin). First, patients will enter a three-month double-blind RCT (1,1 randomization, stratification according to ABMR phenotype and study site) and will receive either clazakizumab (subcutaneous administration of 25 mg in monthly intervals) or placebo. In a second open-label part of the trial (months 4-12), all patients will receive clazakizumab at 25 mg every month. The primary endpoint is safety and tolerability. Secondary endpoints are the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of clazakizumab, its effect on drug metabolism in the liver, DSA characteristics, morphological ABMR lesions and molecular gene expression patterns in three- and 12-month protocol biopsies, serum/urinary biomarkers of inflammation and endothelial activation/injury, Torque Teno viral load as a measure of overall immunosuppression, kidney function, urinary protein excretion, as well as transplant and patient survival. Discussion: Currently, there is no treatment proven to be effective in halting the progression of late ABMR. Based on the hypothesis that antagonizing the effects of IL-6 improves the outcome of DSA-positive late ABMR by counteracting DSA-triggered inflammation and B cell/plasma cell-driven alloimmunity, we suggest that our trial has the potential to provide proof of concept of a novel treatment of this type of rejection.

AB  - Background and Aim: Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are circular, single-stranded DNA viruses, which infect a wide range of animals including livestock and companion animals. Swine TTVs (torque teno sus viruses [TTSuVs]) are thought to act as a primary or coinfecting pathogen in pathological conditions such as porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome. So far, the presence of the virus has not been reported in India. Considering that TTSuVs have the potential to cross the species barrier into humans and that pork consumption is common in North-Eastern states of India, the current study aims to investigate the presence of TTSuV in the Indian pig population. Materials and Methods: A total of 416 samples were collected during 2014-2018, from both apparently healthy pigs and also from pigs suspected of having died from classical swine fever and/or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. These samples were screened for TTSuV infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing techniques. Results: The presence of the virus was confirmed in 110 samples from 12 different states of India. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences obtained from the PCR products indicated the presence of viruses of both Iotatorquevirus and Kappatorquevirus genera in India. Conclusion: The study is the first report on the presence of TTSuVs in India and highlights the circulation of both genera of the virus in the country. © 2019 Veterinary World. All rights reserved.

AB  - Little is known about the role of genetic variation in the genes for cytokines and susceptibility to viral infection especially torque teno virus (TTV) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. In this study, the association between interleukin-12, interleukin-17, interleukin-10 (IL-12,-17,-10) and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) polymorphisms was evaluated in patients with TTV infection who underwent allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from South of Iran. The single nucleotide polymorphisms in the cytokine genes including IL-12 (-1188A/C), IL-17 (-197G/A), IL-10 (-1082G/A, -819C/T and -592C/A) and TNF-α (-308 G/A) were analyzed by PCR-RFLP methods. While our results did not show any association between IL-17, IL-12 and IL-10 (-819C/T and -1082G/A) polymorphisms and TTV infection status, heterozygote genotype of IL-10 (-592C/A) had direct correlation with TTV infection and A allele of TNF-α (-308G/A) showed a protective effect against TTV infection (P = 0.05 and P = 0.025, respectively). Within the group of patients who experienced acute graft-versus-host disease, the AA genotype and the A allele of IL-17 (-197 G/A) were significantly higher in non-infected patients compared to infected ones (p = 0.024 and p = 0.057, respectively). It was also observed that among infected patients, the GG genotype of IL-17 and AA genotype of TNF-α were significantly increased in hematopoietic stem cell transplanted patients with low grade (grade I+II) acute graft-versus-host disease compared to high grade (grade III and IV) disease (p = 0.056 and p = 0.056, respectively). Taken together, genetic variation of IL-10 (-592C/A) and TNF-α (-308G/A) genes might be associated with susceptibility to TTV infection post hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. © 2019 AEPress, s.r.o..

AB  - Enteric viral diseases of swine are one of the most frequent disorders causing huge economic losses in pork production. After the reappearance of an emerging enteropathogen, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) in Hungary in 2016, an extensive survey was initiated in an attempt to identify diarrhoea-related porcine viruses, including adeno-, astro-, boca-, calici-, circo-, corona-, kobu-, rota- and Torque teno viruses. A total of 384 faecal samples collected during a two-year period from diarrhoeic and asymptomatic pigs of various ages in 17 farms were screened by conventional and real-time PCR methods. Half of the samples contained at least one examined virus with the dominance of kobuvirus (55.1%) followed by bocaviruses (33.2%) and rotavirus groups A and C together (20.9%), while coronaviruses including PEDV were not found in this set of samples. Statistical analysis showed a highly significant difference (P < 0.0001) in the frequency of single infections compared to mixed ones with the exception of weaned pigs, in which group additionally most viruses were detected. The results of this study suggest that the complexity of this disease may vary with age, which makes the prevention of diarrhoea a challenge, especially in weaned pigs. *Corresponding author; E-mail: valko.anna@univet.hu; Phone: 0036 (1) 251-9900;

AB  - Background: The virome is a network of viruses normally inhabiting humans. It forms a conspicuous portion of the so-called microbiome, once generically referred to as resident flora. Indeed, viruses infecting humans without leading to clinical disease are in-creasingly recognized as part of the microbiome and have an impact on the development of our immune system. In addition, they activate inflammasomes, multiprotein complexes that assemble in cells and that are responsible for the downstream effects of sensing pathogens. Objective: This review aims at summarizing the evidence on the role of the virome in modu-lating inflammation and emphasizes evidence for Anelloviruses as useful molecular markers to monitor inflammatory processes and immune system competence. Method: We carried out a review of the literature published in the last 5 years and summa-rized older literature to take into account ground-breaking discoveries concerning inflamma-some assembly and virome. Results: A massive amount of data recently emerging demonstrate that the microbiome closely reflects what we eat, and many other unexpected variables. Composition, location, and amount of the microbiome have an impact on innate and adaptive immune defences. Viruses making up the virome contribute to shaping the immune system. Anelloviruses, the best known of such viruses, are present in most human beings, persistently without causing apparent disease. Depending on their interplay with such viruses, inflammasomes instruct host defences to tolerate or forfeit a specific microorganism. Conclusion: The virome plays an important role in shaping human immune defences and contributes to inflammatory processes by quenching or increasing them. © 2019 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Currently, it is believed that TTV and HGV display multifaceted activities in developing diverse acute and chronic processes (disorders affecting the liver, respiratory tract, hematopoiesis oncology diseases etc.). Transfusion of contaminated blood and its components contribute in transmission of HGV and TTV infections. In connection with this, examining a role for HGV and TTV in etiological structure of pediatric liver damage in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as well as their relation to developing toxic liver damage against during ongoing therapy is of special interest. Our study was aimed at assessing hospital-acquired HGV and TTV infection and its potential effect on the incidence rate and liver damage intensity in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A rationale for the current study was previously verified hepatitis of unknown etiology excluding viral hepatitis B and C in such patients. In the study, there were examined 99 patients stayed at the Department of Hematology as well as 286 samples from diverse donor blood-derived products. The data obtained were examined by using epidemiological methods (retrospective and near real-time epidemiological analysis, prospective observation), microbiological monitoring, ELISA, PCR followed by analyzing with variation statistics methods. It was found that 51 children, mainly aged 2-4 years (47.1%), were diagnosed with new onset acute lymphoblastic leukemia during a six-year follow-up study. Treatment phase-specific dynamic investigation demonstrated a progressive increase in frequency of HGV-infected ALL patients from 9.8% (day 15 of therapy) up to 45.1% (maintenance therapy). Moreover, a therapeutic intervention was associated with TTV infection detected in 100% cases in baseline TTV DNA-negative patients 100%, and its rate was significantly increased. Thus, our study allowed to demonstrate that 48% and 77% ALL pediatric patients were infected HGV and TTV, respectively, at initial treatment phase (remission induction), that was paralleled with administering the maximum-dose parenteral therapy, including transfusion therapy. Finally, assessing blood donor-derived preparations allowed to detect HGV RNA and TTV DNA in 6.6±1.46% and 19.3±2.9% cases, respectively. © 2019 Saint Petersburg Pasteur Institute.

AB  - Solid waste storage in specially designated areas – landfills – has been the basic method of municipal solid waste disposal management for many years. However, thermal treatment is the currently preferred method of solid waste disposal. Hygienic assessment of working conditions in municipal waste incineration plants is hindered due to the variability and complexity of pollutants emitted during the combustion process. For many years studies describing this problem have focused mainly on chemical pollution inside the plants as well as emitted into the atmosphere. Available data indicates the presence of organic dust at workplaces in the range 0.1–14 mg/m 3 . It has been proven that it is a carrier of a wide spectrum of microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi and both mesophilic and thermophilic actinomycetes as well as adenoviruses and torque teno virus (TTV). In the air, at workplaces, bacterial endotoxins have also been found in concentrations reaching even 50 000 EU/m 3 , which may significantly affect the occurrence of pro-inflammatory reactions in the lungs as well as toxic pneumonitis. Biological agents should be taken into account in the occupational risk assessment for harmful agents present in this environment, and an in-depth characterization of exposure and health effects resulting from contact with these agents should be continued to an even greater extent than before.

AB  - Worldwide Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV, genus Iotatorquevirus) species have been regarded as possible agents associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease. Iotatorquevirus species possess high genomic variability, suggesting that diverse genotypes are widely geographically distributed. In this study, we validated the genomic variability of Iotaroquevirus species in pigs with postweaned multisystemic wasting syndrome. Genomic DNA from nine TTSuV1a-positive tissues and 15 TTSuV1b-positive tissues was used to amplify the complete ORF2 of each species by nested PCR to perform a molecular characterization. It was found that Mexican TTSuV1a sequences belong to genotype B, sharing phylogenetic origin, high nucleic acid and amino acid sequence similarity and dominant epitope conformation with commercially linked countries, such as the United States, Canada and China, whereas the Mexican TTSuV1b sequences belong to genotype A, being more divergent among each other and displaying low nucleotide identity with worldwide genotype A sequences. In both Iotatorquevirus species, a PTPase-like signature motif was identified in the predicted amino acid sequence, being more conserved for Mexican TTSuV1b sequences than for Mexican TTSuV1a sequences, in which several substitutions were observed. These changes may influence the conformation of dominant epitopes as different arrays were determined among TTSuV1a genotypes. ORF2 variability may account for pathogenic differences by modifying viral replication and immune response, as depicted for human TTV. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD), first identified in 1967, is a pediatric vasculitis of unknown etiology that has an increasing incidence in Japan and many other countries. KD can cause coronary artery aneurysms. Its epidemiological characteristics, such as seasonality and clinical picture of acute systemic inflammation with prodromal intestinal/respiratory symptoms, suggest an infectious etiology for KD. Interestingly, multiple host genotypes have been identified as predisposing factors for KD. To explore experimental methodology for identifying etiological agent(s) for KD and to optimize epidemiological study design (particularly the sample size) for future studies, we conducted a pilot study. For a 1-year period, we prospectively enrolled 11 patients with KD. To each KD patient, we assigned two control individuals (one with diarrhea and the other with respiratory infections), matched for age, sex, and season of diagnosis. During the acute phase of disease, we collected peripheral blood, nasopharyngeal aspirate, and feces. We also determined genotypes, to identify those that confer susceptibility to KD. There was no statistically significant difference in the frequency of the risk genotypes between KD patients and control subjects. We also used unbiased metagenomic sequencing to analyze these samples. Metagenomic sequencing and PCR detected torque teno virus 7 (TTV7) in two patients with KD (18%), but not in control subjects (P = 0.111). Sanger sequencing revealed that the TTV7 found in the two KD patients contained almost identical variants in nucleotide and identical changes in resulting amino acid, relative to the reference sequence. Additionally, we estimated the sample size that would be required to demonstrate a statistical correlation between TTV7 and KD. Future larger scale studies with carefully optimized metagenomic sequencing experiments and adequate sample size are warranted to further examine the association between KD and potential pathogens, including TTV7.

AB  - Myocarditis is an inflammatory disease of the myocardium and leads to cardiac dysfunction and heart failure. Although viral infections are considered to be the most common etiology of myocarditis, the identification of the causative virus is still challenging. Recently, next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied in the diagnosis of infectious diseases. The aim of the current study was to comprehensively analyze potential pathogenic microorganisms using NGS in the sera of patients with myocarditis. Twelve pediatric and five adult patients hospitalized for acute myocarditis were included. Serum samples in the acute phase were obtained and analyzed using NGS to detect pathogen-derived DNA and RNA. Viral sequence reads were detected in 7 (41%) of the 17 myocarditis patients by NGS. Among these patients, detection of Epstein-Barr virus, human parvovirus B19, torque teno virus, and respiratory syncytial virus reads by NGS was consistent with polymerase chain reaction or antigen test results in one patient each. A large number of human pegivirus reads were detected from one patient by RNA sequencing; however, its pathogenicity to human is unknown. Conversely, the number of detected virus-derived reads was small in most cases, and the pathophysiological role of these viruses remains to be clarified. No significant bacterial or fungal reads other than normal bacterial flora was detected. These data indicate that comprehensive detection of virus-derived DNA and RNA using NGS can be useful for the identification of potential pathogenic viruses in myocarditis. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Massive amounts of metagenomics data are currently being produced, and in all such projects a sizeable fraction of the resulting data shows no or little homology to known sequences. It is likely that this fraction contains novel viruses, but identification is challenging since they frequently lack homology to known viruses. To overcome this problem, we developed a strategy to detect ORFan protein families in shotgun metagenomics data, using similarity-based clustering and a set of filters to extract bona fide protein families. We applied this method to 17 virus-enriched libraries originating from human nasopharyngeal aspirates, serum, feces, and cerebrospinal fluid samples. This resulted in 32 predicted putative novel gene families. Some families showed detectable homology to sequences in metagenomics datasets and protein databases after reannotation. Notably, one predicted family matches an ORF from the highly variable Torque Teno virus (TTV). Furthermore, follow-up from a predicted ORFan resulted in the complete reconstruction of a novel circular genome. Its organisation suggests that it most likely corresponds to a novel bacteriophage in the microviridae family, hence it was named bacteriophage HFM. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Monitoring the human virome has been recently suggested as a promising and novel area of research for identifying new biomarkers which would help physicians in the management of transplant patients. Imbalance of the immune system in transplant recipients has a significant impact on replication of Torquetenovirus (TTV), the most representative and abundant virus of human virome. TTV kinetic was studied by real-time PCR in 280 liver or kidney transplant recipients who underwent different drug regimens to maintain immunosuppression. During one-year post-transplant follow-up, TTV viremia fluctuated irrespective of transplanted organ type but consistent with the immunosuppression regimen. TTV kinetic in patients who manifested cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation within the first four months post-transplant differed from that observed in patients who did not experience CMV complications. Importantly, plasma TTV load measured between day 0 and 10 post-transplant was significantly higher in CMV DNA positive than in CMV DNA negative patients. TTV viremia above 3.45 log DNA copies/ml within the first 10 days post-transplant correlates with higher propensity to CMV reactivation following transplantation. This study provides further evidence for using early post-transplant TTV viremia to predict CMV reactivation in liver or kidney transplant recipients. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - A novel blood-borne virus called the human hepegivirus 1 (HHpgV-1) was recently discovered in hemophilia patients. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of HHpgV-1 in hemophilia patients. A total of 436 serum samples were investigated for the presence of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human pegivirus-1 (HPgV-1), torque teno virus (TTV), and HHpgV-1. Out of the 436 patients, 163 (37.4%), 19 (4.4%), 76 (17.4%), and four (0.9%) patients were positive for HCV, HPgV-1, TTV, and HHpgV-1, respectively. HHpgV-1 patients had a mean viral load of 4.9 ± 0.3 log RNA copies/mL and were co-infected with HCV-1a, HPgV-1, and TTV. Moreover, three HHpgV-1-positive patients exhibited stage F0 liver fibrosis. HCV viral load in HHpgV-1-positive patients was lower than those of HHpgV-1-negative patients. Results also revealed that co-infection of HHpgV-1 with HPgV-1 and HCV may play a protective role in patients with chronic HCV. In conclusion, we detected a low frequency of HHpgV-1 infection in hemophilia patients, and results suggested that HHpgV-1 infection was correlated with the presence of other blood-borne viruses and is likely to also correlate with low HCV viral load and reduced severity of liver disease. Additional studies are required to further investigate the clinical importance of HHpgV-1. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC), a common piglet disease, causes substantive economic losses in pig farming. To investigate the viral diversity associated with PRDC, the viral communities in serum and nasal swabs from 26 PRDC-affected piglets were investigated using metagenomics. By deep sequencing and de novo assembly, 17 viruses were identified in two pooled libraries (16 viruses from serum, nine from nasal swabs). Porcine circovirus (PCV)-2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and pseudorabies virus, all commonly associated with PRDC, were identified in the two pooled samples by metagenomics, but most viruses comprised small linear and circular DNAs (e.g. parvoviruses, bocaviruses and circoviruses). PCR was used to compare the detection rates of each virus in the serum samples from 36 PRDC-affected piglets versus 38 location-matched clinically healthy controls. The average virus category per sample was 6.81 for the PRDC-affected piglets and 4.09 for the controls. Single or co-infections with PCV-2 or PRRSV had very high detection rates in the PRDC-affected piglets. Interestingly, porcine parvovirus (PPV)-2, PPV-3, PPV-6 and torque teno sus virus 1a were significantly associated with PRDC. These results illustrate the complexity of viral communities in the PRDC-affected piglets and highlight the candidate viruses associated with it. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) in humans is characterized by ubiquitous occurrence in peripheral blood (PB), without any related disease described to date. Several studies reported a significant increase of TTV plasma DNA levels in allogeneic transplant recipients, and suggested a correlation of elevated virus titers with immunosuppression and transplant-related complications. However, the site of viral replication in this setting has remained unclear. We have studied TTV in serial plasma specimens derived from 43 pediatric allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients by RQ-PCR, and found increasing TTV-DNA levels in all patients post-transplant, with a peak around day +100 and maximum virus copy numbers reaching 4 × 10E9/ml. To assess whether the virus replicates in PB-cells, leukocyte subsets including granulocytes, monocytes, NK-cells, T- and B-lymphocytes were serially isolated by flow-sorting for TTV analysis in 19 patients. The virus was undetectable in most cell types, but was identified in granulocytes in all instances, revealing a median DNA copy number increase of 1.8 logs between days +30–100 post-transplant. Our data therefore provide evidence for TTV replication in granulocytes in this setting. In a control cohort of immunocompetent children and in HSCT recipients before day +30, TTV positivity in granulocytes was less common (33%), and the copy numbers were considerably lower. However, rising TTV replication about 2 weeks after granulocyte engraftment (>500 cells/μl) was observed suggesting that granulocyte recovery might be required for TTV expansion in severely immunosuppressed transplant recipients. © 2018 Kosulin, Kernbichler, Pichler, Lawitschka, Geyeregger, Witt and Lion.

AB  - Over recent years, there has been increasing interest in the use of the anelloviruses, the major component of the human virome, for the prediction of post-transplant complications such as severe infections. Due to an important diversity, the comprehensive characterization of this viral family over time has been poorly studied. To overcome this challenge, we used a metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) approach with the aim of determining the individual anellovirus profile of autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) patients. We conducted a prospective pilot study on a homogeneous patient cohort regarding the chemotherapy regimens that included 10 ASCT recipients. A validated viral mNGS workflow was used on 108 plasma samples collected at 11 time points from diagnosis to 90 days post-transplantation. A complex interindividual variability in terms of abundance and composition was noticed. In particular, a strong sex effect was found and confirmed using quantitative PCR targeting torque teno virus, the most abundant anellovirus. Interestingly, an important turnover in the anellovirus composition was observed during the course of the disease revealing a strong intra-individual variability. Although more studies are needed to better understand anellovirus dynamics, these findings are of prime importance for their future use as biomarkers of immune competence. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Neurological complications (NC) in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients lead to long-term sequelae and result in significant morbidity and mortality. Since risk factors for NC include viral infection or reactivation, virome inspection after HSCT might be helpful to the clinical management of patients after HSCT. Objectives and study design: In this study we investigated whether any viruses are found in association with NC after HSCT. For this purpose, unbiased next generation sequencing (NGS) was used to characterize nucleic acid (NA) content in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken at time of NC in 35 HSCT patients. Virome definition in CSF from non-transplanted subjects (controls) was also tested to define the commensal flora. Results and conclusions: A higher number of reads/contigs mapped to viruses in patients compared to the controls (7,626 vs 235). Besides bacteriophages, Torque teno virus (TTV) was also identified in both controls and patients. Interestingly, a significantly higher number of TTV-like sequences was detected in the patient samples (7,236 vs 9), showing similarities to distinct genotypes; 3/2,575, 2/1,692 and 2/2,969 contigs/reads mapped to TTV11, TTV13 and Torque teno midi virus, respectively. In conclusion, unbiased NGS demonstrated to be a suitable approach to characterize the virome in samples containing limiting amounts of NA. The higher TTV levels and genetic diversity found in CSF of subjects with NC after HSCT might suggest a possible association between TTV reactivation and the disorder. However, further studies are needed to evaluate the possible role of TTV on NC in HSCT patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: Chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver disease. Infection triggers an immediate immune response in the host that is mediated by humoral/cellular mechanisms. T cells respond to infection via secretion of cytokines, which inhibit or stimulate one another, leading to cytokine imbalance and ultimately affecting treatment. Studies using interferon (IFN) and ribavirin (RBV) showed that TCD8+ cells and cytokine levels are associated with sustainable virological response (SVR). However, studies that investigated the effects of triple therapy (TT) are limited. Methods: The study included hepatitis C virus (HCV)+ RNA, naives, genotype 1, ≥18 years, and advanced fibrosis (F≥3) patients. Samples were collected at baseline and after 12 weeks (W12) of TT. Six cytokines were analyzed by flow cytometry. Results: Of 31 patients, four were excluded (two deaths, one interrupted TT, and one F2 patient). Of the 27 remaining patients, 21 (78%) were cirrhotic. SVR was achieved in 63% of the patients. The patients had a mean age of 55.11 ± 10.03 years. Analyses at baseline showed that the chemokine CCL5/Regulated on Activation, Normal T Cell Expressed and Secreted (RANTES) (p=0.04) and interleukin (IL)-6 (p=0.02), which was associated with SVR. RANTES (p=0.04) and IL-8 (p=0.01) levels were associated with SVR at W12. Conclusions: Similar to patterns observed during double therapy, IL-6, IL-8, and RANTES levels were associated with SVR in TT, indicating the potential role of interferon in immune response to hepatitis C virus. © 2018, Sociedade Brasileira de Medicina Tropical.

AB  - An age-related dysregulation of immune response, known as immunosenescence, contributes to increased susceptibility to infections, frailty and high risk of mortality in the elderly. Torquetenovirus (TTV), a circular, single-stranded DNA virus, is highly prevalent in the general population and it may persist in the organism, also in association with other viruses such as cytomegalovirus (CMV), causing chronic viremia. The relationship that TTV establishes with the immune system of infected hosts is not clear. It is known that TTV encodes microRNAs (miRNAs) that might contribute to immune evasion and that the highest viral loads are found in peripheral blood cells. Moreover, it is suspected that TTV infection lead to increased production of inflammatory mediators, thus playing a role in immunosenescence. We investigated the association of TTV load and miRNAs expression with inflammatory and immune markers and the influence of TTV load on mortality within a cohort of 379 elderly subjects who were followed up for 3 years. TTV DNA load in polymorphonuclear leukocytes was slightly positively correlated with age and negatively associated with serum albumin levels and NK cell activity. A marginal positive correlation between TTV DNA load, monocytes and IL-8 plasma levels was found in females and males respectively. TTV DNA copies ≥4.0 log represented a strong predictor of mortality (Hazard ratio = 4.78, 95% CI: 1.70–13.44, after adjusting for age, sex and the main predictors of mortality rate) and this association remained significant even after the CMV IgG antibody titer was included in the model (HR = 9.83; 95% CI: 2.48–38.97; N = 343 subjects). Moreover, multiple linear regression model showed that TTV miRNA-t3b of genogroup 3 was inversely associated with triglycerides, monocytes and C-reactive protein, and directly associated with IL6. Overall these findings suggest a role of TTV in immunesenescence and in the prediction of all-cause mortality risk in Italian elderly subjects. Further studies are needed to fully understand the pathogenic mechanisms of TTV infection during aging. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We report here high rates of detection (50.8%, 31/61 pigs) of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in kidneys of slaughter-age, apparently healthy pigs on St. Kitts island, Lesser Antilles. TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a were detected in 23 (37.7%) and 13 (21.3%) pigs, respectively, including mixed infection in five animals. By nucleotide sequence identities and phylogenetic analysis, significant genetic diversity was observed among both TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a on St. Kitts, with TTSuVk2a showing higher genetic diversity than TTSuV1. Fourteen (45.2%) and 10 (32.2%) of the TTSuV infected pigs tested positive for porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine parvovirus (PPV), respectively, revealing high rates of co-infection of TTSuV with PCV2 and PPV. This is the first report on detection and genetic diversity of TTSuV from the Lesser Antilles. Also, PCV2 and PPV were detected for the first time in the Lesser Antilles. Considering the impact of pig farming on the regional livestock economy, the increasing demand for local pork and lack of information on emerging and re-emerging porcine viruses in the Lesser Antilles, the present findings have important implications on swine health. © 2018 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Purpose. Renal impairment is a common complication after liver transplantation (LT). While BK polyomavirus (BKV) has been linked to renal failure in kidney transplant recipients, Torque teno virus (TTV) is a surrogate marker for immunosuppression that does not have a clear association with any human disease. The impact of BKV and TTV on renal impairment after LT is unknown. Methodology. In this retrospective study, urine and serum samples from 136 liver transplant recipients were screened for BKV and TTV by quantitative PCR. In addition, serum was screened for BKV-specific antibodies and the VP1 typing region was sequenced for BKV genotyping. All parameters were correlated with clinical data. Results/Key findings. BK viruria was detected up to 21 years after transplantation in 16.9% of cases. BK viraemia was detected in 8.7% of patients with BK viruria up to 4 years after LT. BKV-specific antibodies were detected in 93.6% of all LT recipients and correlated with BKV viral load in urine. There was no correlation between renal impairment and the detection of BK DNA in urine (OR 0.983). TTV DNA was detected in 84.6% of serum samples and in 66.6% of urine samples. The TTV viral load in serum correlated with the BKV viral load but had no impact on renal impairment. Conclusion. Our data indicate that the detection of BKV and TTV is not a risk factor for renal impairment after LT. A correlation of TTV and BKV viral load seems to be an indicator for the immune status of the host. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infection is common worldwide in both healthy and diseased swine and a relationship between this virus and a particular disease in pigs has not been established. This work aimed to investigate the presence of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2a in Porcine Circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-infected and non-infected domestic pigs and free-living wild boars from Uruguay. Our data evidenced a high frequency of detection and a wide circulation of TTSuV among pig herds and wild boar populations. Furthermore, TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a co-infection was more frequent than single infections in domestic pigs. In addition, we thoroughly characterized at the molecular level TTSuV strains by extensive sequence data analysis. Our findings revealed an extremely high genetic heterogeneity among Uruguayan isolates. On the basis of detailed analyses, we proposed a more comprehensive criterion of TTSuV classification which would contribute to shedding light over the genetic diversity of these viruses worldwide. On the other hand, data obtained suggested that neither TTSuV1 nor TTSuVk2a frequency of infection or viral loads have any correlation with PCV2 infection, health status or age. The role of TTSuV during co-infection with other pathogens and the age-related dynamics of TTSuV infection are currently under debate. Therefore, taking into account the controversial epidemiological data regarding these viruses and their ubiquitous infection, a likely role as components of the host microbiota should be brought into discussion. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Viral diversity associated with Antarctic wildlife remains poorly studied. Nonetheless, over the past 5 years, there has been a concerted effort using viral metagenomics approaches to identify and characterize viruses associated with Antarctic pinniped and avian species. Here we used a viral metagenomics approach to identify circular DNA viruses in buccal swab samples from Antarctic fur seals (Arctocephalus gazella) breeding on Livingston Island, Antarctica during the 2016/2017 field season. We identified two new lineages of anelloviruses, torque teno Arctocephalus gazella virus (TTAgV)-1 (2083 nts) and -2 (2127–2143 nts), which are most closely related to and cluster with a previously identified anellovirus associated with California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) sharing ~ 60% genome-wide pairwise identity. The ORF1 of TTAgVs share 26–41% amino acid similarity to the ORF1 of other previously identified pinniped-associated anelloviruses. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background. Drug-induced immunosuppression following kidney transplantation is crucial to prevent allograft rejection, but increases risk for infectious disease. Tailoring of drug dosing to prevent both rejection and infection is greatly desirable. The apathogenic and ubiquitous torque teno virus (TTV) reflects immunocompetence of the host and might be a potential candidate for immunologic monitoring. Methods. To assess TTV as an infection biomarker, virus load was prospectively quantified in peripheral blood of 169 consecutive renal allograft recipients at the Medical University Vienna. Results. Patients with infection showed higher TTV levels compared to patients without infection (4.2 × 10 8 copies/mL [interquartile range, IQR, 2.7 × 10 7 –1.9 × 10 9 ] vs 2.9 × 10 7 [IQR 1.0 × 10 6 –7.2 × 10 8 ]; P = .006). Differences in TTV load became evident almost 3 months before infection (median 77 days, IQR 19–98). Each log level of TTV copies/mL increased the odds ratio for infection by 23% (95% confidence interval 1.04–1.45; P = .014). TTV &gt;3.1 × 10 9 copies/mL corresponded to 90% sensitivity to predict infections. Logistic regression demonstrated independent association between TTV levels and infection. Conclusions. TTV quantification predicts infection after kidney transplantation and might be a potential tool to tailor immunosuppressive drug therapy. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Plasma torque teno virus (TTV) DNA load directly correlates with the degree of T-cell immune reconstitution early after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Here, the kinetics of oral TTV DNA shedding was examined to assess whether quantitation of TTV DNA load in saliva may either replace or complement that in plasma for predicting lymphocyte (ALC) reconstitution after engraftment. This prospective observational study enrolled 38 nonconsecutive allo-HSCT recipients. Saliva and plasma specimens were collected at baseline (pretransplant) and at around days +30, +50, and +90 after allo-HSCT. TTV DNA was quantitated in both specimen types by real-time PCR. ALCs were measured by cytometry. A total of 104 paired saliva and plasma specimens were available for TTV PCR analyses. TTV DNA was detected more frequently in saliva than in plasma specimens at all time points (overall, 94.2% vs 86.5%). Increasing levels of TTV DNA were seen in both specimen types from day +30 to day +90 after transplantation. Overall, TTV DNA loads were significantly higher in saliva than in plasma specimens (P =.0002) and correlated significantly (P ≤.0001). A direct correlation between TTV DNA loads in saliva and plasma and ALCs was observed after engraftment (P =.034 and P =.002, respectively). Future studies should be aimed at determining whether monitoring of oral TTV DNA shedding may be of any utility for inference of immune reconstitution after allo-HSCT. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) causes demyelination of white matter of central nervous system and neuro-degeneration due to inflammation. Different types of MS, as well as disease progression, come with different pathology and pathophysiology. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible association between different micro-organisms and the relapse or progression of MS. Studies indexed in Medline/PMC, Scopus and Web of Science published without time and language limitation until March 2017 were identified through the search terms “infection” or “infectious” and “multiple sclerosis”. A total of 20878 abstracts were identified through the initial search terms. Selection of articles and assessment of their quality was done based on Cochrane library guidelines. Full texts were reviewed for 33 articles out of which 14 articles met the criteria for inclusion. Different micro-organisms are known to play roles in the pathogenesis of MS and its relapse; including Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), Human herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7), Epstein–Barr virus (EBV), Chlamydia pneumoniae and Torque teno virus (TTV). But in this review only HHV-6, C. pneumoniae and TTV have been considered to play a role in disease progression in some studies and not all of them. This review concluded that some micro-organisms such as HHV-6, C. pneumoniae and TTV have been considered as cofactors to make MS a progressive type. It should be considered that these findings do not necessarily rule out the role of other pathogens in MS progression but may represent population differences or different sensitivity of the technique used. © 2018, Belgian Neurological Society.

AB  - Background: Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small DNA viruses whose replication is closely linked to immune status. A growing number of publications underlined the potential of TTV viral load as an indicator of immunosuppression. Objectives: To demonstrate the analytical performance of the first standardized RUO (Research Use Only) assay to detect and quantify human TTV DNA in whole blood and plasma. Study design: We established analytical performances for TTV load measurement in various populations. The TTV kinetics were followed in kidney recipients. TTV viral load was analyzed on whole blood samples from 42 kidney recipients follow-up, 53 kidney deceased donors and 31 healthy volunteers. Results: The qPCR TTV assay detects the most prevalent human TTV genotypes and does not cross react with other viruses. Limit of detection was 2.2 log 10 copies/mL in whole blood and plasma, linearity and precision were demonstrated over the range 1.61 to 10.61 log 10 copies/mL in whole blood. Prevalence of TTV DNA in blood differed significantly among groups: 45% in healthy volunteers, 74% in donors and 83% in kidney recipients. In kidney recipients, early TTV kinetics were comparable to those previously observed with in-house assays in other transplant settings: viral load increased from an average of 4.3 log 10 to 7.9 log 10 copies/mL within the first 75 days post transplantation. Conclusion: This TTV assay showed high analytical sensitivity, specificity, linearity and precision. It is a useful standardized tool to further evaluate TTV load as a biomarker of immune status that could improve individual treatment strategy. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - At least 12% of human cancers are caused by virus infection. To understand whether other viruses are associated with human cancers, a viral metagenomics approach was used to analyze the composition of the viral communities of the serum of the patients with Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In this report, a human anellovirus TTMV named TTMV-SH was discovered from three patients with HL. The complete genome of TTMV-SH is 2812nt in length. Phylogenetic analysis based on ORF1 indicated that TTMV-SH of the 11 isolates cluster with TTMV strain TLMV-CBD231 sharing only 60.3-62% sequence similarity, and the sequences divergence is 41.5-43.1%, which indicates that TTMV-SH is a novel species. The TTMV-SH prevalence in HL group, especially in nodular sclerosing Hodgkin's lymphomas (NSHL), was significantly higher than in the healthy group implicated that the TTMV-SH may be associated with HL, especially NSHL. © 2018 Pan, Yu, Wang, Lu, Wang, Xie and Feng.

AB  - Background: Human anelloviruses (TTV, TTMDV and TTMV) are at high prevalence all across the globe, having also a controversial disease-inducing potential. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of anelloviral DNA in the Romanian human population and to investigate the association of infections with common pathologies in Romanian population. Methods: After informed consent, blood samples were collected from 2000 subjects represented by: clinically healthy individuals (n = 701) and a group of patients with pathologies linked to low grade inflammation or alteration of carbohydrate metabolism (n = 1299). All samples were analysed for the presence of TTV, TTMDV and TTMV DNA by hemi-nested PCR. Results: The prevalence of TTV, TTMDV and TTMV in the studied population was 68.2, 54.4%, respectively 40.1%, lower than the recent reports from other geographic regions. The three viral species were significantly more frequent in the group of patients compared to the healthy subjects and were associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The presence of anelloviral DNA was also associated with medical procedures (e.g. haemodialysis/transfusions, surgical procedures) and previous hepatitis A virus infection. Lifestyle choices related to alcohol consumption, smoking, physical activity and living environment were not associated with differences in distribution of the three viruses. Conclusion: Further evidence is needed to establish a correlation between infection with human anelloviruses and a pathology or group of pathologies. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Routine large-scale xenotransplantation from pigs to humans is getting closer to clinical reality owing to several state-of-the-art technologies, especially the ability to rapidly engineer genetically defined pigs. However, using pig organs in humans poses risks including unwanted cross-species transfer of viruses and adaption of these pig viruses to the human organ recipient. Recent developments in the field of virology, including the advent of metagenomic techniques to characterize entire viromes, have led to the identification of a plethora of viruses in many niches. Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses are the largest group prevalent in virome studies in mammals. Specifically, the ssDNA viral genomes are characterized by a high rate of nucleotide substitution, which confers a proclivity to adapt to new hosts and cross-species barriers. Pig-associated ssDNA viruses include torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV) in the Anelloviridae family, porcine parvoviruses (PPV), and porcine bocaviruses (PBoV) both in the family of Parvoviridae, and porcine circoviruses (PCV) in the Circoviridae family, some of which have been confirmed to be pathogenic to pigs. The risks of these viruses for the human recipient during xenotransplantation procedures are relatively unknown. Based on the scant knowledge available on the prevalence, predilection, and pathogenicity of pig-associated ssDNA viruses, careful screening and monitoring are required. In the case of positive identification, risk assessments and strategies to eliminate these viruses in xenotransplantation pig stock may be needed. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Background: Both hepatitis B and C viruses were transmitted through blood transfusion before implementation of donor screening. The existence of additional, yet unknown transfusion transmittable agents causing liver disease could have important public health implications. Methods: Analyses were based on the Scandinavian Donations and Transfusions (SCANDAT2) database. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of developing chronic liver disease in recipients of blood from donors who later developed any chronic liver disease compared to recipients who received blood transfusion from healthy donors. We also studied whether the risk of liver disease was increased in patients who received units from ‘high-risk’ donors, defined as donors who had a higher than expected occurrence of liver disease amongst their previous recipients. All analyses were stratified before and after 1992 to account for the effect of screening for hepatitis C virus. Results: A total of 1 482 922 transfused patients were included in the analyses. Analyses showed evidence of transfusion transmission of liver diseases before, but not after the implementation of hepatitis C virus screening in 1992, with HRs for any liver disease of 1.38 [95% confidence interval (CI), 1.30–1.46] and 0.99 (95% CI, 0.91–1.07), before and after 1992, respectively. Similarly, blood components from ‘high-risk’ donors conferred increased risks before, but not after 1992. Conclusions: Our data provide no evidence for transfusion transmission of agents causing liver disease after the implementation of screening for hepatitis B and C, and suggest that if such transmission does occur, it is rare. © 2018 The Association for the Publication of the Journal of Internal Medicine

AB  - Introduction: Zinc plays an important role in thymic function and immune homeostasis. We performed a prospective clinical trial using a high-dose zinc oral supplementation to improve the immune reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Patients and methods: We enrolled 18 patients undergoing autologous HSCT for multiple myeloma. Nine patients were randomized to receive only a standard antimicrobial prophylaxis; whereas, nine patients received in addition 150 mg/day of zinc from day +5 to day +100 after transplant. Results: CD4+ naïve lymphocytes and TRECs showed a significant increase from day +30 until day +100 only in the zinc-treated group. Moreover, the load of Torquetenovirus, a harmless virus that replicates in course of immunedepression, increased at day +100 only in the control group. No severe adverse events were reported during the zinc consumption. Conclusion: First data from the ZENITH trial suggest that high-dose zinc supplementation is safe and may enhance the thymic reconstitution after HSCT.

AB  - Objective To develop and verify a PCR assay for Torque teno sus virus type 1 (TTSuVl) and type 2 (TTSuV2) in the cells and trypsin for production of vaccine for human use as well as the final product of vaccine. Methods Partial DNA sequences of TTSuVl (JN688927) and TTSuV2 (AY823991) genomes were synthesized according to the two sequences in GenBank, and inserted into vector pUC57. The constructed recombinant plasmids were used as templates for TTSuVl gene fragment at a length of 316 bp and TTSuV2 gene fragment at a length of 252 bp by PCR. The PCR assay was verified for sensitivity and specificity, by which Vero, KMB17, MRC5, Hep2 and BT cells, two batches of 0. 1% trypsin, three batches of virus harvests of inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine made from Sabin strain (SIPV), one batch of final product of SIPV, one batch of final product of hepatitis A (live) vaccine, freeze-dried (fHAV), and one batch of final product of inactivated enterovirus type 71 vaccine (EV71) were tested. Results The minimum detection limits of developed PCR assay for TTSuVl and TTSuV2 were 10 and 0. 01 fg/μL respectively. Specific TTSuVl and TTSuV2 genes were amplified by the developed PCR assay. No TTSuVl and TTSuV2 DNAs were found in two batches of trypsin, Vero, KMB17, MRC5, Hep2 and BT cells as well as six batches of vaccines. Conclusion A PCR assay for TTSuV raw materials and cells for vaccine production as well as harvest and final product of vaccine was successfully developed, which showed high sensitivity and specificity, and might be used for the determination of TTSuV in vaccine production in Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Science and Peking Union Medical College. © 2018 Changchun Institute of Biological Products.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus is a small chronically persisting circular negative ssDNA virus reaching near 100% prevalence. It is reported to be a marker for immune function in immunocompromised patients. The possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission remains controversial but incidence rate of TTV DNA in children increased with age. TTV dynamics well studied for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as a predictor of post-transplant complications but there is no viral proliferation kinetics data for other patient groups or healthy individuals. The aim of this study was to determine TTV dynamics during the first year of life of healthy infants. Methods: Ninety eight clinically healthy breastfeeding infants (1-12 months of age) were analyzed by quantitative PCR for the whole blood TTV load with the test sensitivity of about 1000 viral copies per milliliter of blood (total number of samples including repeatedly tested infants was 109). Results: 67% of all analyzed samples were TTV-positive demonstrating significant positive correlation between age and TTV load (r = 0.81, p < 0.01). Conclusions: This is the first study to suggest that viral load increases during the first year of life reaching a plateau after 6 months with strong proliferation for the first 60 days. Our data well correlates with TTV dynamics in patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is a circular single-stranded DNA virus that may co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), especially in the high-risk community e.g. the transgender performing high-riskbehavior. TTV shows an increased viremia in HIV patients and maybe influence the HIV clinical progression. Blood samples collected from transgender performing high-riskbehavior in Surakarta were tested by serological and molecular assays to detect the presence of HIV infection. The blood samples with HIV positive status were then tested by a nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the presentation of TTV DNA. The amplified PCR products were molecularly cloned and subjected to sequence analysis. TTV DNA was detected in 40.0% HIV-positive samples. The molecular characterization revealed that the most prevalent was genogroup 3, followed by genogroup 2 and 1, respectively. TTV was detected in HIV-infected transgender performing high-riskbehavior in Surakarta with high infection rate. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The microbiome, a thriving and complex microbial community colonizing the human body, has a broad impact on human health. Colonization is a continuous process that starts very early in life and occurs thanks to shrewd strategies microbes have evolved to tackle a convoluted array of anatomical, physiological, and functional barriers of the human body. Cumulative evidence shows that viruses are part of the microbiome. This part, called virome, has a dynamic composition that reflects what we eat, how and where we live, what we do, our genetic background, and other unpredictable variables. Thus, the virome plays a chief role in shaping innate and adaptive host immune defenses. Imbalance of normal microbial flora is thought to trigger or exacerbate many acute and chronic disorders. A compelling example can be found in the respiratory apparatus, where early-life viral infections are major determinants for the development of allergic diseases, like asthma, and other non-transmissible diseases. In this review, we focus on the virome and, particularly, on Anelloviridae, a recently discovered virus family. Anelloviruses are major components of the virome, present in most, if not all, human beings, where they are acquired early in life and replicate persistently without causing apparent disease. We will discuss how modulation of innate and adaptive immune systems by Anelloviruses can influence the development of respiratory diseases in childhood and provide evidence for the use of Anelloviruses as useful and practical molecular markers to monitor inflammatory processes and immune system competence. © 2018 Freer, Maggi, Pifferi, Di Cicco, Peroni and Pistello.

One hundred and ten of 132 (83.3%) PCV3-positive samples were co-infected with Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1). Ninety-four of 132 (71.2%) PCV3-positive samples were co-infected with Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). Sixty-six of 132 (50.0%) of PCV3-positive samples were co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. There were no clinical signs of infection in pigs that were both PCV3-positive and PCV2-negative, in either multiparous sows or live-born infants. The high co-infection rate provides valuable information for the further study of the pathological correlation between PCV3 and TTSuVs. © 2017 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Background. Major hurdles for survival after lung transplantation are rejections and infectious complications. Adequate methods for monitoring immune suppression status are lacking. Here, we evaluated quantification of torque teno virus (TTV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as biomarkers for defining the net state of immunosuppression in lung-transplanted patients. Methods. This prospective single-center study included 98 patients followed for 2 years after transplantation. Bacterial infections, fungal infections, viral respiratory infections (VRTI), cytomegalovirus (CMV) viremia, and acute rejections, as well as TTV and EBV levels, were monitored. Results. The levels of torque teno virus DNA increased rapidly after transplantation, likely due to immunosuppressive treatment. A modest increase in levels of Epstein-Barr virus DNA was also observed after transplantation. There were no associations between either TTV or EBV and infectious events or acute rejection, respectively, during follow-up. When Tacrolimus was the main immunosuppressive treatment, TTV DNA levels were significantly elevated 6-24 months after transplantation as compared with Cyclosporine treatment. Conclusions. Although replication of TTV, but not EBV, appears to reflect the functionality of the immune system, depending on the type of immunosuppressive treatment, quantification of TTV or EBV as biomarkers has limited potential for defining the net state of immune suppression. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Aims: This study describes an immunoassay to detect anti-torque teno virus (TTV) antibodies using a peptide obtained from expression of the N22 region of TTV genotype 2. Methods: The N22 region (∼500 bp) of TTV genotype 2 was cloned in a pET-28a(+) vector and expressed in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium. Following metal affinity chromatography, a purified polypeptide was used as an antigen for the development of an immunoassay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in human sera. Results: Recombinant protein (∼25-kDa) was obtained after 24 h of incubation at 25°C in ZYM-5052 autoinduction medium. A blot assay developed using this polypeptide as an antigen and TTV-positive sera as the primary antibody produced a distinct spot on the nitrocellulose membrane. Serum samples from 36 of 42 patients with renal disease and 29 of 48 patients with liver diseases produced a positive signal using this immunoassay. Simultaneously, 18 of 48 healthy controls were also detected to be positive for anti-TTV antibodies. These results were found to be comparable with TTV detection using PCR, and the assay showed a high sensitivity and specificity (i.e., 97.44 and 91.67%, respectively). Moreover, this assay could detect TTV infection irrespectively of the genotype, including cases of mixed infection. Conclusion: The present immunoassay using the N22 expression product may be used as an alternative to PCR to detect TTV infection in large populations. © 2018 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Empirical studies have revealed that travel time variability (TTV) can significantly affect travelers’ behaviors and planners’ cost-benefit assessment of transportation projects. It is therefore important to systematically quantify the value of TTV (VTTV) and its impact. Recently, Fosgerau's valuation method makes this quantification possible by converting the value of travel time (VTT) and the VTTV into monetary unit. Travel time reliability ratio (TTRR), defined as a ratio of the VTTV to the VTT, is a key parameter in Fosgerau's valuation method. Calculating TTRR involves an integral of the inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the standardized travel time distribution (STTD), i.e., the mean lateness factor. Using a well-fitted STTD is a straightforward way to calculate TTRR. However, it will encounter the following challenges: (1) determination of a well-fitted STTD; (2) non-existence of an algebraic expression for the CDF and its inverse CDF; and (3) lack of a closed-form expression to efficiently calculate TTRR. To circumvent the above issues, this paper proposes a distribution-fitting-free analytical approach based on the Cornish-Fisher expansion as an alternative way to calculate TTRR without the need to fit the whole CDF. The validity domain is rigorously derived for guaranteeing the accuracy of the proposed method. Realistic travel time datasets that cover 17 links are used to systematically explore the feature and accuracy of the proposed method in estimating TTRR. The comparative results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently and effectively estimate TTRR. When travel time datasets satisfy the validity domain, the proposed method outperforms the distribution fitting method in estimating TTRR. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Background: The 2020 Sustainable Development goals call for 100% certified interruption or control of the three main forms of Chagas disease transmission in Latin America. However, how much will achieving these goals to varying degrees control Chagas disease; what is the potential impact of missing these goals and if they are achieved, what may be left? Methods: We developed a compartmental simulation model that represents the triatomine, human host, and non-human host populations and vector-borne, congenital, and transfusional T. cruzi transmission between them in the domestic and peridomestic settings to evaluate the impact of limiting transmission in a 2,000 person virtual village in Yucatan, Mexico. Results: Interruption of domestic vectorial transmission had the largest impact on T. cruzi transmission and prevalence in all populations. Most of the gains were achieved within the first few years. Controlling vectorial transmission resulted in a 46.1–83.0% relative reduction in the number of new acute Chagas cases for a 50–100% interruption in domestic vector-host contact. Only controlling congenital transmission led to a 2.4–8.1% (30–100% interruption) relative reduction in the total number of new acute cases and reducing only transfusional transmission led to a 0.1–0.3% (30–100% reduction). Stopping all three forms of transmission resulted in 0.5 total transmission events over five years (compared to 5.0 with no interruption); interrupting all forms by 30% resulted in 3.4 events over five years per 2,000 persons. Conclusions: While reducing domestic vectorial, congenital, and transfusional transmission can successfully reduce transmission to humans (up to 82% in one year), achieving the 2020 goals would still result in 0.5 new acute cases per 2,000 over five years. Even if the goals are missed, major gains can be achieved within the first few years. Interrupting transmission should be combined with other efforts such as a vaccine or improved access to care, especially for the population of already infected individuals. © 2018 Lee et al.

AB  - Between May 2015 and May 2017, 496 animals (473 murine rodents and 23 house shrews) were captured in six regions of China. A total of 22.8% (113/496) of throat swabs, 29.1% (142/488) of fecal samples and 23.8% (54/227) of serum samples tested positive for rodent torque teno virus 3 (RoTTV3). The positive rate in Rattus norvegicus was higher than the rate in Rattus tanezumi and Rattus losea. Of 23 house shrews, one throat swab and one serum sample were positive for RoTTV3. Ten murine rodents were simultaneously positive for RoTTV3 in throat swab, fecal and serum samples. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 12 near-full length genomes of RoTTVs sequences obtained in this study represented a novel RoTTV genotype (RoTTV3). In conclusion, high prevalence rates of RoTTV3 were found in three common murine rodents in China, and the RoTTV3 obtained in this study were classified as a novel genotype of RoTTV. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Several studies have reported that viral infections are related to lung cancer. We previously reported the involvement of Torque teno virus (TTV) in patients with lung cancer and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of TTV in lung cancer growth, and its influence on changes in TTV DNA titers due to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) in lung cancer patients are poorly understood. Methods: Serum TTV DNA titers were measured in serum samples obtained from patients with lung cancer. Forty-eight patients with primary lung cancer, including 8 patients with IPF, were enrolled. Serum TTV DNA titers were quantitated before and after chemotherapy. In addition, patients were classified into two groups according to the presence or absence of IPF, and clinical characteristics were compared between these two groups. Results: Among the 33 patients with partial response to treatment or stable disease in the lung cancer, the mean TTV DNA titer in 28 patients without IPF had significantly decreased after chemotherapy. In contrast, the mean TTV DNA titer in the 5 patients with IPF tended to increase after chemotherapy. In the 15 patients with progressive lung cancer, TTV DNA titers were significantly elevated in those with and without IPF. Conclusion: In lung cancer patients without IPF, changes in TTV titers may be correlated with tumor growth. However, in lung cancer patients with IPF, TTV titers were not consistently associated with chemotherapy responses. Therefore, IPF may have an influence on changes in TTV DNA titers. © 2018

AB  - Microbiological safety of reclaimed water is one of the most important issues in managing potential health risks related to wastewater recycling. Presence and removal of human adenovirus (HAdV), human polyomavirus (HPyV), human torque teno virus (HTtV) and somatic coliphage family Microviridae in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in sub-tropical Brisbane, Australia was investigated. All three WWTPs employ activated sludge process with added on Bardenpho process for nutrient removal. HPyV, HAdV, HTtV and Microviridae were consistently detected in the influent (105 to 106 Genomic copies (GC) L− 1) and secondary treated effluent (102 to 103GC L−1). The results of this study suggest that, under appropriate conditions, WWTPs with activated sludge process in sub-tropical climate could be an effective treatment barrier with &gt; 3 log10 removal of enteric virus. The geometric mean of pooled data for each virus from all sites showed the highest removal for HPyV (3.65 log10) and lowest for HAdV (2.79 log10) which was statistically significant (p = 0.00001). Whereas, the removal rate of HTtV and Microviridae was identical (2.81 log10). A poor correlation between the presence of enteric virus in influent or effluent with routinely monitored physicochemical parameters suggests limited use of physicochemical parameters as predictors of enteric virus presence. High prevalence of HAdV in influent and effluent combined with comparatively low removal suggest that it could be used as a model microorganism for determining enteric virus removal efficacy. Additional tertiary treatment may be required prior to effluent reuse for non-potable purposes or discharge into the recreational waters to prevent exposure of people to health hazards. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A metagenomic approach based on target independent next-generation sequencing has become a known method for the detection of both known and novel viruses in clinical samples. This study aimed to use the metagenomic sequencing approach to characterize the viral diversity in respiratory samples from patients with respiratory tract infections. We have investigated 86 respiratory samples received from various hospitals in Kuwait between 2015 and 2016 for the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections. A metagenomic approach using the next-generation sequencer to characterize viruses was used. According to the metagenomic analysis, an average of 145, 019 reads were identified, and 2% of these reads were of viral origin. Also, metagenomic analysis of the viral sequences revealed many known respiratory viruses, which were detected in 30.2% of the clinical samples. Also, sequences of non-respiratory viruses were detected in 14% of the clinical samples, while sequences of non-human viruses were detected in 55.8% of the clinical samples. The average genome coverage of the viruses was 12% with the highest genome coverage of 99.2% for respiratory syncytial virus, and the lowest was 1% for torque teno midi virus 2. Our results showed 47.7% agreement between multiplex Real-Time PCR and metagenomics sequencing in the detection of respiratory viruses in the clinical samples. Though there are some difficulties in using this method to clinical samples such as specimen quality, these observations are indicative of the promising utility of the metagenomic sequencing approach for the identification of respiratory viruses in patients with respiratory tract infections. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Many emerging infectious pathogens are well known for existing in healthy blood donors and could be transmitted via blood transfusion or plasma derivatives usage. Therefore, there is an urgent need to discover the pathogens in qualified blood donation to avoid potential threats to blood safety. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The objective of this study was to investigate the microbiome that existed in pooled plasma from different manufacturers in Chengdu and Guiyang. Random polymerase chain reaction, large-scale clone sequencing, and bioinformatics were used to investigate the metagenomics and microbiome structure of pooled plasma. Among detected microbiomes, potential pathogens were subsequently identified. RESULT: After host DNA cleaning, 551 clones were classified as bacteria; 88 clones were classified as viruses, and four clones were considered to be parasites, respectively. Thirteen kinds of bacteria and two kinds of parasites that might potentially threaten blood safety were identified along with six kinds of nonpathogenic viruses. The infection status of one identified pathogen Coxiella burnetii was evaluated in 1638 plasma samples. The reactive rate of immunoglobulin (Ig)G1 was 1.10% (18/1638), the reactive rate of IgG2 was 0.85% (14/1638), and the reactive rate of IgM was 0.98% (16/1638). CONCLUSION: Some pathogens that were already considered as threats to blood safety were discovered in those pooled plasma such as C. burnetii, Orientia tsutsugamushi, and Plasmodium sp. As a result, we should initiate some specific tests in the endemic area on plasma donors to enhance the blood safety in China. © 2017 AABB

AB  - Monitoring Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA load helps to estimate the risk of opportunistic infections in solid organ transplant recipients. We investigated whether the early kinetic pattern of plasma TTV DNA load after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) associates with subsequent CMV and EBV DNAemia. This study included 71 allo-HSCT patients. We found that the area under the curve (AUC) for log 10 TTV DNA loads quantified by days 20 and 30 after transplantation (TTV DNA load AUC 20-30), was significantly lower (P=0.036) in patients who subsequently developed CMV DNAemia requiring preemptive antiviral therapy (n=17) than in those who did not (n=8) or had no CMV DNAemia (n=19). Patients displaying TTV DNA load AUC 20-30 1/22.8 copies × days × mL '1 were more likely to have high-level CMV DNAemia. A trend towards a direct correlation between TTV DNA AUC 20-30 and CMV-specific interferon-3 CD8+ T-cell counts by day +30 was noted (P=0.095). However, this dynamic parameter was not useful for anticipating the occurrence of either CMV recurrences (n=12) or EBV DNAemia (n=34). In summary, it may be possible to identify a subset of allo-HSCT patients at a high risk of developing high-level CMV DNAemia by analyzing the kinetics of plasma TTV DNA load early after engraftment.

AB  - Torque teno viruses [TTVs] are negative sense, single-stranded, DNA viruses, which are distributed globally in several mammalian hosts such as humans, apes, sheep and swine in a species-specific manner. While the pathogenic potential of TTVs is under debate, recent experimental studies in gnotobiotic pigs indicate that swine TTVs, TTSuV1 in particular, can act as a primary or co-infecting pathogen. Hence, determining whether TTSuV1 can infect other mammals would eventually further our understanding of viral pathogenesis, especially in coinfections. In this study, we tested sera from horses, cattle, sheep, dogs and elk for the presence of TTSuV1 DNA using a panel of TTSuV1-specific primers, and assessed the extent of sero-conversion to TTSuV1 in the selected species. We found that TTSuV1 DNA was detected in 46.7% of equines, 70% of canine, 100% of bovine, 40% of ovine and 93.3% of elk samples. However, significant TTSuV1 specific antibody responses were detected only in the bovine, ovine and equine samples but not the canine or elk samples, indicating that these animals could support the replication of TTSuV1. This combined serological and molecular epidemiological profile of TTSuV1 infection in five different species indicates the host range of species-specific TTVs could be wider than initially believed. Further studies are required to understand the health risks to these animal species from TTSuV-1 infection. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Ticks are blood-feeding arachnids that are vectors of several important human and animal pathogens. Little is known about single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses that are associated with these ectoparasites. As part of a pilot study to identify ssDNA viruses present in ticks, female American dog ticks (Dermacentor variabilis) and blacklegged ticks (Ixodes scapularis) were collected in eastern Pennsylvania (USA), and the extracted viral DNA was analyzed using viral metagenomics approaches. Three genomoviruses were recovered from pooled samples of D. variabilis (n = 2) and I. scapularis (n = 1): two belonging to the genus Gemycircularvirus, sharing < 63% pairwise identity with other members within the genus; and the third belonging to the genus Gemykolovirus, sharing < 70% pairwise identity to other gemykoloviruses. Furthermore, a genome of an anellovirus belonging to the sharing 62–65% nucleotide identity with torque teno canis viruses (genus Thetatorquevirus) was also recovered from a D. variabilis pooled sample. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Background Acute asthma exacerbations and pneumonia are important causes of morbidity and mortality in children and may coexist in the same children, although symptom overlap may lead to difficulties in diagnosis. Microbial and viral diversity and differential abundance of either may play an important role in infection susceptibility and the development of acute and chronic respiratory diseases. Objectives To describe the virome and bacteriome present in the upper respiratory tract of hospitalized children with a clinical diagnosis of asthma and pneumonia during an acute exacerbation and an acute respiratory illness ARI episode respectively. Methods During the winter seasons of 2013–2014 and 2014–2015, 134 nasopharyngeal swabs samples of children >15 years of age with ARI hospitalized at a referral hospital for respiratory diseases were selected based on clinical diagnosis of asthma or pneumonia. The virome and bacteriome were characterized using Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and in-house bioinformatics analysis pipeline. Results The Asthma group was represented mainly by RV-C, BoV-1 and RSV-B and the pneumonia group by Bacteriophage EJ-1 and TTMV. TTV was found in both groups with a similar amount of reads. About bacterial composition Moraxella catarrhalis, Propionibacterium acnes and Acinetobacter were present in asthma and Veillonella parvula and Mycoplasma pneumoniae in pneumonia. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were mostly found with both asthma and pneumonia. Conclusions Our results show a complex viral and bacterial composition in asthma and pneumonia groups with a strong association of RV-C presence in asthmatic children. We observed Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae concurrently in both groups. © 2018 Romero-Espinoza et al.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small DNA-viruses, of the genus Alphatorquevirus, whose replication is linked to immune status. TTV load may be an indicator for efficacy of IS in lung transplant recipients (LTRs). In a prospective single-center-study 143 LTRs were followed up and tested by quantitative TTV-DNA PCR. Using multivariate Cox-regression contribution of TTV-load to the occurrence of severe infections, chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), acute cellular rejection (ACR), and death was assessed. During follow-up 28 (20%) patients developed infections with a rate of 7.7 per 100 patient-years (PY). The hazard-ratio (HR) associated with a one-log10 increase of TTV-load before the event was 5.05. CLAD occurred with a rate of 6.0%-PY. HR for a 1 log10 increase of the lowest TTV level before the event was 0.71 (CI: 0.54-0.93). TTV-load predicts clinical events and may be useful to optimize IS during the first years of follow-up of LTRs. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - The torque teno virus (TTV) has a heterogeneous genome and its role in hepatitis C (HCV) infection is still controversial, therefore the purpose of the present study was to determine if there is any association between Hepatitis C and TTV co-infection and to determine the phylogenetic relationship between existing types in the Pakistani population. A total of 500 individuals (250 HCV positive patients and 250 healthy controls) were selected. DNA was extracted from serum samples and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region of TTV was performed. Out of 500 samples 9 HCV positive index cases (3.6%) and 8 healthy samples (3.2%) were found to be positive for TTV. A comparison was made between TTV sequences reported from all over the world with the ones obtained in the present study by sequencing of TTV positive samples followed by phylogenetic analysis using maximum parsimony (MP) method. Our results indicated that the virus was undergoing divergent evolution as very high sequence diversity was found in the ORF1 gene. The study also shows that association between HCV and TTV was not found. Because the virus was found to be affecting both healthy individuals and HCV infected population with almost same frequency. Therefore a thorough screening of TTV virus at the population level is required in order to draw a comprehensive inference. © 2018, Malaysian Society for Parasitology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objectives: Demonstrate that DNA viremia is common in pediatric sepsis and quantitate its associations with host immune function and secondary infection risk. Design: Retrospective analysis of a prospective cohort study. Patients: Seventy-three children admitted with sepsis-induced organ failure. Interventions: None. Measurements and Main results: This study was performed as an ancillary investigation to a single-center prospective study of children with severe sepsis. Longitudinally collected, batched, frozen plasma was examined using real time-polymerase chain reaction for the presence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, herpes simplex virus, human herpes virus-6, torque teno virus, and adenovirus DNA. Innate immune function was also measured longitudinally via quantification of ex vivo lipopolysaccharide -induced tumor necrosis factor-α production capacity. Viral DNAemia with a virus other than torque teno virus was detected in 28 of 73 subjects (38%) and included cytomegalovirus 5%, Epstein-Barr virus 11%, herpes simplex virus 4%, human herpes virus-6 8%, and adenovirus 26%. In addition, torque teno virus was detected in 89%. Epstein-Barr virus DNAemia was associated with preexisting immune suppression (p = 0.007) Viral DNAemia was associated with preexisting immune suppression and high risk for the subsequent development of secondary infection (p < 0.05 for both). Subjects with viral DNAemia had lower innate immune function over time compared with those who were virus negative (p < 0.05). Conclusions: DNAemia from multiple viruses can be detected in septic children and is strongly associated with preexisting immune suppression and secondary infection risk. The role of DNA viruses in the perpetuation of impaired host defense in this setting should be the subject of prospective study. © 2017 by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the World Federation of Pediatric Intensive and Critical Care Societies.

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) has been proposed as a marker of immune function in patients receiving immunosuppression after solid organ transplantation. This study aimed to define TTV plasma dynamics and investigate clinical associations in patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). This was a single-center prospective longitudinal study involving 50 consecutive patients treated with HSCT between March 2015 and April 2016. TTV plasma DNA levels were measured with quantitative PCR at 12 consecutive time points during the first year after HSCT. Forty of the 50 patients (80%) had detectable TTV viremia before HSCT (median level, 5.37 log10 copies/mL; interquartile range [IQR], 3.51-6.44 log10 copies/mL). All patients subsequently developed TTV viremia during the follow-up period. Plasma viral loads evolved dynamically over time, with a peak of 8.32 log10 copies/mL (IQR, 7.33-9.35 log10 copies/mL) occurring at 79 days (IQR, 50-117 days) following HSCT and a stable plateau toward the end of the follow-up period. The type of malignancy, the use of antithymocyte globulin during conditioning, and the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease requiring systemic therapy had temporary effects on TTV dynamics. TTV levels showed a significant correlation with absolute lymphocyte counts following engraftment (r s = -.27; P &lt;.01) and with cytomegalovirus (CMV; r s =.39; P &lt;.01) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV; r s =.45; P =.02) viral loads during phases of viremia. Immune-related clinical events were not predicted by TTV levels. TTV viremia occurred universally and was sustained throughout the first year after HSCT. Several variables and events before and after HSCT were correlated with TTV levels and hint toward immune marker properties of TTV, but their complex interactions might perturb the capability of TTV to predict immune-related complications in this population. © 2017 The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation

AB  - Background: Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus. Renal transplant patients have a higher risk of TTV infection. Objective: To evaluate the prevalence of TTV and its correlation with post-renal transplantation complications in a population of Iranian patients. Methods: A cross-sectional study was performed on 120 renal transplant recipients. TTV infection in the peripheral blood samples was detected by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (semi-nested PCR). Then, the relationship between TTV and renal post-transplant complications was examined. Results: 34.2% renal transplant recipients were positive for TTV. There was a significant correlation between the presence of TTV and diabetes, acute transplant rejection, and urinary tract infection. We did not find any direct correlation between the presence of TTV infection and hypertension, hyperlipidemia, respiratory tract infection, and cytomegalovirus infection. Conclusion: We found an increased rate of TTV infection in renal transplant recipients associated with post-transplantation complications. TTV may be an important risk factor for some post-renal transplantation complications. © 2018, Iranian Society for Organ Transplantation.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno viruses, TTV) and other animals including swine (Torque teno sus viruses, TTSuV). Two genetically distinct TTSuV species have been identified from swine thus far (TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2), although their definitive association with disease remains debatable. In 2012, a novel TTSuV species was identified from commercial swine serum and classified in the genus Kappatorquevirus as TTSuVk2b. The other Kappatorquevirus species, TTSuVk2a, has been associated with post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) when coinfected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Therefore, in this study, we initially amplified a portion of TTSuVk2b ORF1 and, subsequently, assessed the molecular prevalence of the virus in pigs in the United States. A total of 127 serum and 115 tissue samples were obtained from pigs with PMWS or mulberry heart disease (MHD) in six states and tested by PCR for the presence of TTSuVk2b DNA. Approximately 27.6% of the serum and 21.7% of tissue samples tested positive for TTSuVk2b DNA, and the positive products were confirmed by sequencing. However, we did not detect a correlation between TTSuVk2b infection and PMWS or MHD. The near full-length genomic sequence of US TTSuVk2b was determined, and sequence analysis revealed that the US TTSuVk2b isolates were 95% identical to the TTSuVk2b isolate from Spain, with most of the variations clustering in ORF1. We conclude that the novel TTSuVk2b species is present in pigs in the United States and its potential association with a disease warrants further investigation. © 2016 Blackwell Verlag GmbH

AB  - Anelloviruses are single-strand circular DNA viruses and ubiquitous within the human population. Although there is no direct evidence, many studies have suggested the anelloviruses may be associated with a variety of diseases. In this study, a novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was detected in a child with unexplained encephalitis. The detected virus had a circular genome of 2943 nt in length and 3 open reading frames. It shared 45.4% – 35.9% nucleotide identities with known TTMV species and < 35% with the other species of anellovirus, which suggested it might belong to a new species within the genus Betatorquevirus. Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences of ORF1 showed that this virus represented a distinct branch within the diversity of anellovirus. Whether this novel anellovirus strain is associated with encephalitis requires further study.

AB  - We describe a novel species of torque teno mini virus called TTMV-204, which was isolated from the gingival epithelium of patients with periodontitis and characterized using viral metagenomics. The sequence of the full genome is 2824 nt in length. Phylogenetic analysis and genetic analyses show classic Betatorquevirus species organization with less than 40% amino acid similarity in ORF1. The prevalence of TTMV-204 in the periodontitis patient population was 18.75% (15/80), which was higher than in periodontally healthy individuals (10.00%, 10/80). However, the difference of the TTMV-204 prevalence between two groups was not statistically significant (p = 0.115). Further investigation is required to determine whether this new virus is associated with inflammation. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Background: Periodontitis and atherosclerosis represent a chronic inflammatory process. The incidence of periodontitis in cardiac patients with atherosclerosis is a well-established fact. The role of viruses in the etiopathogenesis of both has been proposed. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of Torque Teno virus (TTV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cytomegalovirus (CMV) in cardiac patients with atherosclerosis and coexisting chronic periodontitis (CP). Materials and Methods: Thirty patients (17 males and 13 females) with atherosclerotic plaques and coexisting periodontitis were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Viral DNA was extracted from the subgingival and atheromatous plaque. The presence of CMV, EBV, and TTV in the plaque samples was identified using polymerase chain reaction. The collected data were statistically analyzed for the prevalence of the viruses and Chi-squared test was performed to find out its association with atheroma and CP. Results: The prevalence of CMV, EBV, and TTV in atheromatous plaque was 63.3%, 56.7%, and 46.7%, respectively, as compared to rates of 80%, 63.3%, and 53.3% in subgingival plaque. Results also indicated no significant association of CMV, EBV, and TTV in both samples (P = 0.08, 0.346, and 0.261, respectively). Conclusions: There was no significant association of CMV, EBV, and TTV between subgingival and atheromatous plaque. The prevalence of CMV, EBV, and TTV was high in atheromatous plaque. TTV was isolated from more than 50% of participants in atheromatous plaque, which is a significant finding. © 2018 Indian Society of Periodontology | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - Background Pediatric acute liver failure (PALF) is a rare and severe syndrome that frequently requires liver transplantation. Viruses are one of the most frequent causes of this disease, however, pathogenic viruses are not determined in many patients. Recently next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been applied to comprehensively detect pathogens of infectious diseases of unknown etiology. Objectives To evaluate an NGS-based approach for detecting pathogenic viruses in patients with PALF or acute hepatitis of unknown etiology. Study design To detect virus-derived DNA and RNA sequences existing in sera/plasma from patients, both DNA and RNA sequencing were performed. First, we validated the ability of NGS to detect viral pathogens in clinical serum/plasma samples, and compared different commercial RNA library preparation methods Then, serum/plasma of fourteen patients with PALF or acute hepatitis of unknown etiology were evaluated using NGS. Results Among three RNA library preparation methods, Ovation RNA-Seq System V2 had the highest sensitivity to detect RNA viral sequences. Among fourteen patients, sequence reads of torque teno virus, adeno-associated virus, and stealth virus were found in the sera of one patient each, however, the pathophysiological role of these three viruses was not clarified. Significant virus reads were not detected in the remaining 11 patients. Conclusions This finding might be due to low virus titer in blood at the time of referral or a non-infectious cause might be more frequent. These results suggest an NGS-based approach has potential to detect viral pathogens in clinical samples and would contribute to clarification of the etiology of PALF. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Stem cells have been widely used in tendon tissue engineering. The lack of refined and controlled differentiation strategy hampers the tendon repair and regeneration. This study aimed to find new effective differentiation factors for stepwise tenogenic differentiation. By microarray screening, the transcript factor Fos was found to be expressed in significantly higher amounts in postnatal Achilles tendon tissue derived from 1 day as compared with 7-days-old rats. It was further confirmed that expression of Fos decreased with time in postnatal rat Achilles tendon, which was accompanied with the decreased expression of multiply tendon markers. The expression of Fos also declined during regular in vitro cell culture, which corresponded to the loss of tendon phenotype. In a cell-sheet and a three-dimensional cell culture model, the expression of Fos was upregulated as compared with in regular cell culture, together with the recovery of tendon phenotype. In addition, significant higher expression of tendon markers was found in Fos-overexpressed tendon stem/progenitor cells (TSPCs), and Fos knock-down gave opposite results. In situ rat tendon repair experiments found more normal tendon-like tissue formed and higher tendon markers expression at 4 weeks postimplantation of Fos-overexpressed TSPCs derived nonscaffold engineering tendon (cell-sheet), as compared with the control group. This study identifies Fos as a new marker and functional driver in the early stage teno-lineage differentiation of tendon, which paves the way for effective stepwise tendon differentiation and future tendon regeneration.

AB  - Background The role of occult hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in chronic hepatitis C patients is still uncertain. Aim The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and significance of OBI and TTV infection, and to examine the genetic diversity of these viruses, in chronic hepatitis C patients with and without HCC. Methods Sera from 151 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients (49 patients with HCC and 102 without HCC) negative for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) were tested for the presence of OBI and TTV infection by semi-nested and group-specific multiplex PCR assays, respectively. Nucleotide sequencing of HBV S region was further performed. Results OBI and TTV infection were detected in 5 (3.3%) and 68 (45%) patients, respectively. HBV isolates were classified into genotypes A (4/5, 80%) and D (1/5, 20%), and no HBsAg escape mutation was observed. TTV phylogenetic group 3 was the most prevalent among both HCC and non-HCC patients. OBI and TTV infection were significantly more frequent in patients with HCC than patients without HCC (p = 0.003, and p = 0.009, respectively). Moreover, TTV infection was associated with HCC (OR = 2.23, 95% CI = 1.04–4.80, p = 0.040), independently of liver cirrhosis. Conclusions A low prevalence of OBI was observed in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, and TTV infection was an independent factor associated with the occurrence of HCC. Whether TTV influences the progression of liver disease in chronic hepatitis C patients remains to be elucidated. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Objective: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous virus that is commonly associated with blood transfusion. The main aims of this study were to evaluate the incidence of TTV in polytransfused children with thalassemia and to determine for the first time the prevalent TTV genotypes in Egypt. Methods: TTV was detected in 2 groups by nested PCR: The first group comprised 200 children with thalassemia, and the second included age- A nd sex-matched healthy children with no history of blood transfusion. Results: TTV was detected in 60 and 57%, respectively, of the children with thalassemia and the healthy children. Among the TTV-positive children with thalassemia, 71.6% were HCV positive. No hepatitis B surface antigen was detected in the thalassemic children. Significant elevations of alanine transaminase and aspartate transaminase were found in TTV-positive patients with thalassemia compared to TTV-negative patients. Phylogenetic analysis of sequenced TTV isolates showed close relationships to genotypes 1 and 2. Conclusion: TTV is highly prevalent among children with thalassemia in Egypt, with a relatively high infection rate also detected among healthy children. © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is an established treatment option for several hematological diseases. However, the first year post-transplantation is often complicated by infections and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Improvements in immunological monitoring could reduce such post-transplant complications. Torque Teno virus (TTV), a chronically persisting DNA virus, is reported to be a marker for immune function in immunocompromised patients. In the present study, the TTV kinetics were analyzed to investigate the potential role of TTV viremia as immune-competence read-out after allo-HSCT. Twenty-three monocentric allo-HSCT recipients were retrospectively tested for TTV-DNA in whole blood at given day post-transplant. Dynamics of TTV viremia was analyzed with respect to episodes of non-TTV viral reactivations (CMV, EBV, and BKPyV), acute GVHD, and recovery of immune cells. Recipients affected by persisting viral infections and/or GVHD during the first 100 days after allo-HSCT showed a significantly higher median TTV load at day +30 than patients with a less complicated clinical course (p = 0.005). This was also associated with a total lymphocyte count <5.5E+08 cells/L in this high-risk group (p = 0.039). These findings suggest that TTV could represent an additional parameter to identify patients at higher risk for complications in the first 100 days following allo-HSCT. Prospective studies, including the monitoring of lymphocyte subsets, are required to define the potential use of TTV in immunological monitoring after allo-HSCT. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.

AB  - Microbial food-borne diseases are still frequently reported despite the implementation of microbial quality legislation to improve food safety. Among all the microbial agents, viruses are the most important causative agents of food-borne outbreaks. The development and application of a new generation of sequencing techniques to test for viral contaminants in fresh produce is an unexplored field that allows for the study of the viral populations that might be transmitted by the fecal-oral route through the consumption of contaminated food. To advance this promising field, parsley was planted and grown under controlled conditions and irrigated using contaminated river water. Viruses polluting the irrigation water and the parsley leaves were studied by using metagenomics. To address possible contamination due to sample manipulation, library preparation, and other sources, parsley plants irrigated with nutritive solution were used as a negative control. In parallel, viruses present in the river water used for plant irrigation were analyzed using the same methodology. It was possible to assign viral taxons from 2.4 to 74.88% of the total reads sequenced depending on the sample. Most of the viral reads detected in the river water were related to the plant viral families Tymoviridae (66.13%) and Virgaviridae (14.45%) and the phage viral families Myoviridae (5.70%), Siphoviridae (5.06%), and Microviridae (2.89%). Less than 1% of the viral reads were related to viral families that infect humans, including members of the Adenoviridae, Reoviridae, Picornaviridae and Astroviridae families. On the surface of the parsley plants, most of the viral reads that were detected were assigned to the Dicistroviridae family (41.52%). Sequences related to important viral pathogens, such as the hepatitis E virus, several picornaviruses from species A and B as well as human sapoviruses and GIV noroviruses were detected. The high diversity of viral sequences found in the parsley plants suggests that irrigation on fecally-tainted food may have a role in the transmission of a wide diversity of viral families. This finding reinforces the idea that the best way to avoid food-borne viral diseases is to introduce good field irrigation and production practices. New strains have been identified that are related to the Picornaviridae and distantly related to the Hepeviridae family. However, the detection of a viral genome alone does not necessarily indicate there is a risk of infection or disease development. Thus, further investigation is crucial for correlating the detection of viral metagenomes in samples with the risk of infection. There is also an urgent need to develop new methods to improve the sensitivity of current Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) techniques in the food safety area. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background Torque Teno virus (TTV) plasma DNA load directly correlate with the level of immunosuppresion in different clinical settings. It is uncertain whether this may be the case in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (allo-HSCT). Objectives We characterized the dynamics of TTV DNAemia in patients undergoing T-cell replete allo-SCT. Study design Retrospective single-center observational study including 72 allo-HSCT patients. Plasma TTV DNA loads were quantified before initiating the conditioning regimen and at different time-points after transplant by real-time PCR. White blood cells (WBC) and absolute lymphocyte counts (ALC) were measured by flow cytometry. Results A dramatic drop in plasma TTV DNA load was observed shortly after conditioning. The TTV DNA load increased steadily after engraftment reaching its peak at day +90 after transplant. The increase in TTV DNA load paralleled that of ALC, and was of greater magnitude in patients who developed severe (grades II–IV) acute graft vs. host disease. Conclusion Repopulation of lymphocytes early after allo-HSCT correlates with an increase of plasma TTV DNA load. Prospective studies are nevertheless needed to determine whether the kinetics of TTV DNAemia may allow inference of the degree of overall immunocompetence in these patients. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently discovered DNA virus that has been detected in many different hosts, including humans, livestock and poultry. To date, there is no report of pigeon TTV (PTTV) from anywhere in the world. To investigate the distribution of PTTV in pigeons from the eastern Chinese province of Jiangsu and characterize their genomes, we employed PCR to detect PTTV in 144 samples collected from 6 pigeon plants in Jiangsu province, amplify complete genomes from representative samples and analyze genetic characteristics using bioinformatics. The results demonstrated that 71.5% (103/144) of samples were PTTV positive. The rate of sequence homology among the six PTTV complete genomes obtained from Jiangsu province ranged from 99.7% to 100%. Phylogenetic analysis suggested that PTTV genomes had a high degree of genetic similarity and were similar to chicken anemia virus that also had poultry as a host. Although with the same host, PTTV shared distant relationship with PiCV in both complete genome, Rep and Cap genes. The results of this study provided evidence that PTTV could be detected in Chinese pigeons at a high level, the evolutionary process of complete genome, Rep and Cap genes of Anelloviridae family had obvious divergence. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The Torque teno canis virus (TTCaV) is a small virus with circular single-stranded DNA that has been reported to cause infections in dogs. The present study aimed to identify the presence of TTCaV in blood samples obtained from domestic dogs, and examine its diversity and evolution of the genomes. Five strains of TTCaV were detected, and the overall prevalence was found to be 7% (28/400). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the five genomes were closely clustered with the previously known Cf-TTV10 and LDL strains and formed a Thetatorque virus. Homology analysis of the whole genome showed a sequence identity of 94.6%–96.8% among the five genomes. The percent sequence similarity among the five complete genomes ranged from 95.3% to 97.4% and from 95.1% to 97% compared to the Cf-TTV10 and LDL strains respectively. The ORF1-encoded amino acid sequences showed 94.4%–97.2% identity among the five isolates. Our findings suggest that the TTCaV has a large genetic diversity and showed that TTCaV and canine parvovirus (CPV) co-infection exists in China. Further studies on the pathogenicity of TTCaV are required. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In August 2016, the Food and Drug Administration advised US blood centers to screen all whole blood and apheresis donations for Zika virus (ZIKV) with an individual-donor nucleic acid test (ID-NAT) or to use approved pathogen reduction technology (PRT). The cost of implementing this guidance nationally has not been assessed. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Scenarios were constructed to characterize approaches to ZIKV screening, including universal ID-NAT, risk-based seasonal allowance of minipool (MP) NAT by state, and universal MP-NAT. Data from the 2015 National Blood Collection and Utilization Survey (NBCUS) were used to characterize the number of donations nationally and by state. For each scenario, the estimated cost per donor ($3-$9 for MP-NAT, $7-$13 for ID-NAT) was multiplied by the estimated number of relevant donations from the NBCUS. Cost of PRT was calculated by multiplying the cost per unit ($50-$125) by the number of units approved for PRT. Prediction intervals for costs were generated using Monte Carlo simulation methods. RESULTS: Screening all donations in the 50 states and DC for ZIKV by ID-NAT would cost $137 million (95% confidence interval [CI], $109-$167) annually. Allowing seasonal MP-NAT in states with lower ZIKV risk could reduce NAT screening costs by 18% to 25%. Application of PRT to all platelet (PLT) and plasma units would cost $213 million (95% CI, $156-$304). CONCLUSION: Universal ID-NAT screening for ZIKV will cost US blood centers more than $100 million annually. The high cost of PRT for apheresis PLTs and plasma could be mitigated if, once validated, testing for transfusion transmissible pathogens could be eliminated. © 2017 AABB

AB  - Background: TTV has been detected in almost every human tissue type or body fluid reaching near 100% prevalence. Several studies report mother-to-child postnatal transmission of TTV in infancy but the risk of transplacental transmission of TTV is still unclear. Methods: The blood and plasma collected postpartum from 100 mother-child pairs were analyzed using TTV-specific qPCR. Samples were collected from the peripheral vein of the mother and the umbilical cord. Results: Eighty four percent of pregnant women were TTV positive (median titers: 8 × 104 copies/mL; range: 103 - 3 × 107). The TTV load in plasma was approximately 100 times lower than in whole blood. TTV was not detected in any of cord blood samples. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate the lack of transplacental transmission of TTV (or effective prenatal inhibition of viral proliferation). The presence of the virus in infants may be associated with mother-to-child transmission through breast feeding or other routes of transmission. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Primary graft dysfunction (PGD) is a principal cause of early morbidity and mortality after lung transplantation, but its pathogenic mechanisms are not fully clarified. To date, studies using standard clinical assays have not linked microbial factors to PGD. We previously used comprehensive metagenomic methods to characterize viruses in lung allografts >1 mo after transplant and found that levels of Anellovirus, mainly torque teno viruses (TTVs), were significantly higher than in nontransplanted healthy controls. We used quantitative polymerase chain reaction to analyze TTV and shotgun metagenomics to characterize full viral communities in acellular bronchoalveolar lavage from donor organs and postreperfusion allografts in PGD and non-PGD lung transplant recipient pairs. Unexpectedly, TTV DNA levels were elevated 100-fold in donor lungs compared with healthy adults (p = 0.0026). Although absolute TTV levels did not differ by PGD status, PGD cases showed a smaller increase in TTV levels from before to after transplant than did control recipients (p = 0.041). Metagenomic sequencing revealed mainly TTV and bacteriophages of respiratory tract bacteria, but no viral taxa distinguished PGD cases from controls. These findings suggest that conditions associated with brain death promote TTV replication and that greater immune activation or tissue injury associated with PGD may restrict TTV abundance in the lung. © 2016 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons

AB  - Lung transplant patients are a vulnerable group of immunosuppressed patients that are prone to frequent respiratory infections. We studied 60 episodes of respiratory symptoms in 71 lung transplant patients. Almost half of these episodes were of unknown infectious etiology despite extensive routine diagnostic testing. Methods We re-analyzed respiratory samples of all episodes with undetermined etiology in order to detect potential viral pathogens missed/not accounted for in routine diagnostics. Respiratory samples were enriched for viruses by filtration and nuclease digestion, whole nucleic acids extracted and randomly amplified before high throughput metagenomic virus sequencing. Viruses were identified by a bioinformatic pipeline and confirmed and quantified using specific real-time PCR. Results In completion of routine diagnostics, we identified and confirmed a viral etiology of infection by our metagenomic approach in four patients (three Rhinovirus A, one Rhinovirus B infection) despite initial negative results in specific multiplex PCR. Notably, the majority of samples were also positive for Torque teno virus (TTV) and Human Herpesvirus 7 (HHV-7). While TTV viral loads increased with immunosuppression in both throat swabs and blood samples, HHV-7 remained at low levels throughout the observation period and was restricted to the respiratory tract. Conclusion This study highlights the potential of metagenomic sequencing for virus diagnostics in cases with previously unknown etiology of infection and in complex diagnostic situations such as in immunocompromised hosts. © 2017 Lewandowska et al.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License, which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original author and source are credited.

AB  - The molecular epidemiology data of torque teno virus (TTV) in Indonesia is very rare. This study evaluated the prevalence of TTV in male commercial sex workers, as one of the high risk community for blood borne viruses pathogens in Surakarta, Indonesia. All blood samples collected from male commercial sex workers in Surakarta in 2009-2013 were tested by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The amplified PCR products were molecularly cloned and subjected to sequence analysis. TTV DNA was detected in 80.9% (72/89) samples. Furthermore, the molecular characterization revealed that the most prevalent was genogroup 3, followed by genogroup 2 and l, respectively. TTV was detected in male commercial sex workers in Surakarta with high infection rate. Further investigation about TTV circulation in Indonesian population is needed in order to provide additional information about the genetic variability and TTV epidemiology in Indonesia, especially in the high risk communities. © 2017 Author(s).

AB  - Background. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) remains poorly understood. Although infections are speculated to trigger the syndrome, a specific infectious agent and underlying pathophysiological mechanism remain elusive. In a previous study, we described similar clinical phenotypes in CFS patients and alternatively diagnosed chronic Lyme syndrome (ADCLS) patients'individuals diagnosed with Lyme disease by testing from private Lyme specialty laboratories but who test negative by reference 2-tiered serologic analysis. Methods. Here, we performed blinded RNA-seq analysis of whole blood collected from 25 adults diagnosed with CFS and 13 ADCLS patients, comparing these cases to 25 matched controls and 11 patients with well-controlled systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Samples were collected at patient enrollment and not during acute symptom flares. RNA-seq data were used to study host gene expression, B-cell/T-cell receptor profiles (BCR/TCR), and potential viral infections. Results. No differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were found to be significant when CFS or ADCLS cases were compared to controls. Forty-two DEGs were found when SLE cases were compared to controls, consistent with activation of interferon signaling pathways associated with SLE disease. BCR/TCR repertoire analysis did not show significant differences between CFS and controls or ADCLS and controls. Finally, viral sequences corresponding to anelloviruses, human pegivirus 1, herpesviruses, and papillomaviruses were detected in RNA-seq data, but proportions were similar (P = .73) across all genus-level taxonomic categories. Conclusions. Our observations do not support a theory of transcriptionally mediated immune cell dysregulation in CFS and ADCLS, at least outside of periods of acute symptom flares. © The Author 2017.

AB  - Background Antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) represents one of the cardinal causes of late allograft loss after kidney transplantation, and there is great need for noninvasive tools improving early diagnosis of this rejection type. One promising strategy might be the quantification of peripheral blood DNA levels of the highly prevalent and apathogenic Torque Teno virus (TTV), which might mirror the overall level of immunosuppression and thus help determine the risk of alloimmune response. Methods To assess the association between TTV load in the peripheral blood and AMR, 715 kidney transplant recipients (median, 6.3 years posttransplantation) were subjected to a systematical cross-sectional AMR screening and, in parallel, TTV quantification. Results Eighty-six of these recipients had donor-specific antibodies and underwent protocol biopsy, AMR-positive patients (n = 46) showed only 25% of the TTV levels measured in patients without AMR (P = 0.003). In a generalized linear model, higher TTV levels were associated with a decreased risk for AMR after adjustment for potential confounders (risk ratio 0.94 per TTV log level; 95% confidence interval 0.90-0.99; P = 0.02). Conclusions Future studies will have to clarify whether longitudinal assessment of TTV load might predict AMR risk and help guide the type and intensity of immunosuppression to prevent antibody-mediated graft injury. © 2016 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Genus Iotatorquevirus consists of 2 species, Torque teno sus virus 1a and Torque teno sus virus 1b, which are ubiquitous in swine populations, and are widely reported in association with porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD). To evaluate the relationship with PCVAD, 100 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples were used to detect both Iotatorquevirus species by nested PCR and sequencing. Sixty-eight PCVAD cases were selected as well as 32 porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) non-affected cases. Overall, 33 of the 100 cases were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a and 8 of 100 were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1b. Only 24 of 68 (35%) PCVAD cases were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a; 39% (9/23) of post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, and 33% (15/45) of PCV2-associated reproductive failure cases. Among PCV2 non-affected cases, 28% were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1a and 6% were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1b. Torque teno sus virus 1b was not detected in PCV2-associated reproductive failure cases. Regardless of the PCV2-status, a lower frequency of both Iotatorquevirus species was found than depicted in other reports and there was no statistical relationship with PCVAD (χ2 &lt; 0.01). Given the worldwide genomic variability of Iotatorquevirus species, it is feasible that species prevalent in Mexico share a lower nucleotide sequence identity, leading to different pathogenic potential. © 2017, Canadian Veterinary Medical Association.

AB  - Patients undergoing hemodialysis are at increased risk of infection with blood-borne viruses, including GB virus C (GBV-C) and torque teno virus (TTV). However, the prevalence and genotypic distribution of these viruses in the assessed patients undergoing hemodialysis remains unclear. The present study investigated these issues and the possibility of nosocomial transmission among patients undergoing hemodialysis in a unit in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. GBV-C RNA was detected in 92/161 patients (57.1%) by nested reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis of the 5'-untranslated region (UTR) classifed the GBV-C isolates into genotypes 6 (85%), 2 (8%), 4 (6%), and 3 (1%). TTV DNA was detected in all patients by the amplifcation of the 5'-UTR and open reading frame-1 (ORF1) by nested and semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis based on the ORF1 revealed that genotype 1 was dominant (84%), followed by genotypes 2 (10%) and 3 (6%). The greater prevalence of GBV-C genotype 6 in patients undergoing hemodialysis compared with the general population and the identical sequences observed in multiple isolates provided strong evidence of patient-to-patient transmission. The prevalence of TTV in hemodialysis patients was similar to that observed in the general population, and only one pair of TTV isolates was identical. These results indicated that nosocomial infection was not the main cause of the high prevalence of TTV in patients undergoing hemodialysis. In conclusion, GBV-C and TTV infections are common in patients undergoing hemodialysis in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, and transmission is likely to be nosocomial in the case of GBV-C infection.

AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a transfusion transmitted virus that seems to be involved in several complications such as acute respiratory diseases, liver diseases, AIDS, cancer, and autoimmune reactions. In the present study the frequency of TTV was investigated among ß- thalassemia (BT) and haemodialysis (HD) patients (high risk patients for TTV) in Mazandaran province, Iran. DNA was extracted from the serum of 82 BT and 100 HD patients, and nested PCR method was applied to detect TTV DNA. The aspartate transaminase(AST) and alanine transaminase (ALT) enzyme levels in BT patients were measured using photometric assay. The mean age of BT and HD patients as 23.4±5.4 and 48.8±8.2 years, respectively. 21% of HD and 26.8% of BT patients were infected with TTV, respectively. The frequency of TTV was not significantly different between two groups of patients and there was no significant correlation between sex and TTV infection. The mean AST and ALT levels in TTV positive BT patients was not significantly higher than TTV negative cases. The present study showed that TTV prevalence in BT patients with recurrent blood transfusion was not significantly higher than HD patients. The investigation of TTV prevalence in healthy individuals is recommended to identify if transfusion or dialysis is associated with higher TTV infection. Besides, although TTV infection did not change the AST and ALT enzymes in BT patients, the liver involvement may still exist in these patients.

AB  - The role of viral infections in the etiology of brain cancer remains uncertain. Prior studies mostly focused on transcriptome or viral DNA integrated in tumor cells. To investigate for the presence of viral particles, we performed metagenomics sequencing on viral capsid-protected nucleic acids from 12 primary and 8 metastatic human brain tumors. One brain tumor metastasized from a skin melanoma harbored two new human anellovirus species, Torque teno mini virus Emory1 (TTMV Emory1) and Emory2 (TTMV Emory2), while the remaining 19 samples did not reveal any exogenous viral sequences. Their genomes share 63-67% identity with other TTMVs, and phylogenetic clustering supports their classification within the Betatorquevirus genus. This is the first identification of betatorqueviruses in brain tumors. The viral DNA was in its expected non-integrated circular form, and it is unclear if the viruses contributed to tumor formation. Whether the viruses originated from blood, or the primary skin tumor could not be ascertained. Overall, our results demonstrate the usefulness of viral metagenomics to detect previously unknown exogenous virus in human brain tumors. They further suggest that active viral infections are rare events in brain tumors, but support a follow-up larger scale study to quantify their frequency in different brain tumor subtypes. © Fan Ng et al.

AB  - From the years 2008 to 2014, a total of 1,155 water samples were collected (spring to fall) from 24 surface water sampling sites located in a mixed-used but predominantly agricultural (i.e., dairy livestock production) river basin in eastern Ontario, Canada. Water was analyzed for viable F-specific DNA (F-DNA) and F-specific RNA (F-RNA) (genogroup I [GI] to GIV) coliphage and a suite of molecularly detected viruses (norovirus [GI to GIV], torque teno virus [TTV], rotavirus, kobuvirus, adenovirus, astrovirus, hepatitis A, and hepatitis E). F-DNA and F-RNA coliphage were detected in 33 and 28% of the samples at maximum concentrations of 2,000 and 16,300 PFU · 100 ml-1, respectively. Animal TTV, human TTV, kobuvirus, astrovirus, and norovirus GIII were the most prevalent viruses, found in 23, 20, 13, 12, and 11% of samples, respectively. Viable F-DNA coliphage was found to be a modest positive indicator of molecularly detected TTV. F-RNA coliphage, unlike F-DNA coliphage, was a modest positive predictor of norovirus and rotavirus. There were, however, a number of significant negative associations among F-specific coliphage and viruses. F-DNA coliphage densities of &gt; 142 PFU · 100 ml-1 delineated conditions when ~95% of water samples contained some type of virus. Kobuvirus was the virus most strongly related to detection of any other virus. Land use had some associations with virus/F-specific coliphage detection, but season and surface water flow were the variables that were most important for broadly delineating detection. Higher relative levels of detection of human viruses and human F-RNA coliphage were associated with higher relative degrees of upstream human land development in a catchment. © 2017 American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Background: Anelloviruses (TTV, TTMV, and TTMDV) have been associated with non A-G hepatitis. The goal of the current study was to estimate the prevalence of these anelloviruses in Qatar. Methods: A total of 607 blood samples (500 healthy donors, and 53 HBV-and 54 HCV-positive patients) representing different nationalities were tested for the presence of TTV, TTMV, and TTMDV DNA by nested PCR. Results: Prevalence rates for the three viruses were high in all studied groups, and exceeding 95% in the HBV group (for TTV and TTMDV). Infection with more than one type of viruses was common and significant in most of the positive patients (p < 0.05) and ranging from 55.4% for TTV/TTMV and TTMV/TTMDV co-infections in the healthy group, to 96.3% for TTV/TTMV co-infections in the HBV group. Further, and as with most previous studies, no significant association was found between anelloviruses infections and age, nationality, or gender (p > 0.05) albeit the detection of higher infection rates among females and Qatari subjects. Conclusion: This was the first published study to look at prevalence of Anellowviruses in the Middle East. High prevalence rates of the three viruses in all studied groups was noted. Further studies are needed to explore and compare the different genotypes of these viruses in the region. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small DNA viruses widespread among humans and pigs. The clinical significance of TTV infections in either humans or pigs is uncertain. In fact, TTV viremia is highly prevalent in patients with different pathologies, but it can also be frequently observed in healthy subjects. Virus infection in pigs is considered a putative cofactor in several diseases; despite being detected frequently in healthy animals, its role still remains unknown. The present study aimed to investigate the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) in 62 bile samples collected from pigs at slaughterhouse and in 36 fresh pork liver sausages bought at point of sale. Quantitative Real-Time PCR, confirmed that 19.4 and 58.3 % of bile and sausage samples tested positive for TTSuV, respectively. The mean viral load was established as 5.6 × 104 GE/µl for bile and 7.16 × 103 GE/g for sausages. TTSuV nucleotide sequence analysis confirmed a wide heterogeneity among the circulating TTSuV strains, which included both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Objectives: Because torque teno virus (TTV) has been implicated in tumorigenesis as a cocarcinogen, we studied TTV prevalence in saliva and biopsy samples from head and neck cancer (HNCC) patients, patients with premalignant lesions of oral cancer, and controls. We also wished to determine the TTV genotypes in HNCC patients. Methods: A seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifying the N22 region of the TTV genome, as well as direct sequencing of PCR fragments, was used. Results: TTV prevalence was higher in HNCC patients (saliva: 27/71, 38%; tumor biopsy: 22/74, 30%) than in controls (saliva: 8/56, 14%; oral mucosa: 1/19, 5%). TTV prevalence was also high in patients with premalignant lesions of oral carcinoma (saliva: 9/18, 50%; biopsy: 5/21, 24%). By phylogenetic analysis, TTV belonging mostly to genotypes 1 and 2 was found in HNCC patients. In most of the cases, identical TTV strains were present in the biopsy and salivary sample of the same HNCC patient. In addition, the same TTV strain was detected in 2 laryngeal carcinoma biopsies obtained from 2 independent patients. Conclusions: Our data are compatible with the idea that TTV might act as a cocarcinogen in certain cases of HNCC. Alternatively, HNCC may facilitate either TTV replication or TTV entry into the saliva. © 2016 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Simultaneous Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infections have been reported around the world, generally linked to severe infections. In the present study, 257 swine plasma samples from 31 swine herds located in Brazil, were PCR screened for PCV-2 and TTSuV-1/2 and correlated with clinical data. PCV-2 was detected in 25%, followed by 38.1% and 42.4% of TTSuV-1 and TTSuV-2, respectively. Co-infections of two or three viruses were found in 32.3% of samples. PCV-2 was more frequently detected in the growing (p = 0.030) and finishing phases (p = 0.0005) while TTSuV-2 in the nursery (p = 0.009). Only TTSuV-1 was statistically associated to clinical disease (multiple signs), in combination or not with PCV-2 or TTSuV-2 (p = 0.015). PCV-2/TTSuV co-infections were more frequently related to weight gain reduction in comparison to mono-infections (p = 0.049) and no-infections (p = 0.027), and also in animals with (p = 0.011) or without (p = 0.037) clinical signs, being the nursery the most affected phase (p = 0.025). Our results uphold the pathogenic potential of TTSuV in naturally infected pigs and the clinical/economical impact of this agent, especially in co-infections. Studies addressing the physiopathological mechanisms of simultaneous infections are needed. © 2016

AB  - Advances in DNA sequencing have increased our ability to generate large amounts of sequence data at lower costs. These developments have enabled microbial detection and characterization directly from clinical specimens, known as metagenomic sequencing. Viral metagenomic sequencing was performed on five nasal-And five fecal-swab pools collected from each of two primary and two secondary market slaughterhouses and a cull-swine buying station in the southeastern United States. Sequences were assembled de novo and analyzed by BLASTN to identify viruses present in the samples. Twenty seven different viruses were identified. Reads similar to a diverse family of single-stranded circular DNA viruses were identified in nearly every sample (47 of 50). Other viruses identified at all five sampling sites and in over half of the samples were bocavirus, torovirus, posavirus, torque teno virus, IAS virus, picobirnavirus, and teschovirus. Viruses identified in multiple sites in greater than 20% of the samples included enterovirus, parvovirus, influenza A virus, sapelovirus, and Senecavirus A. Other significant swine viruses detected less frequently include porcine circovirus type 2, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, and porcine deltacoronavirus. Together, these results suggest that metagenomic sequencing is a powerful tool for virus detection and characterization.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV), member of Anelloviridae family, is considered a worldwide distributed emergent virus and is currently classified into seven genogroups. Interestingly, the pathogenicity of TTV remains unclear. However, it has been constantly associated to hepatitis cases of unknown etiology (HUE) as well as extensively studied in concurrent infections with Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV-1). In South America, TTV epidemiological data is scant, involving some studies from Brazil, Venezuela, Colombia and Bolivia. The aim of this work was to investigate for the first time in Uruguay the presence of TTV by a nested-PCR system in 85 human serum samples infected with HBV and/or HCV and/or HIV-1 and in HUE cases. Overall, our results reported a TTV infection rate of 79% (67/85). Furthermore, the molecular characterization of Uruguayan strains revealed that one of them clustered in genogroup 1, while the remaining ones formed separate clusters closely related to genogroup 3, which should be confirmed by complete genome sequencing. Further investigation about TTV circulation in Uruguayan population is needed in order to provide additional information about the genetic variability and TTV epidemiology in South America. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - PURPOSE. To characterize the ocular surface microbiome of healthy volunteers using a combination of microbial culture and high-throughput DNA sequencing techniques. METHODS. Conjunctival swab samples from 107 healthy volunteers were analyzed by bacterial culture, 16S rDNA gene deep sequencing (n = 89), and biome representational in silico karyotyping (BRiSK; n = 80). Swab samples of the facial skin (n = 42), buccal mucosa (n = 50), and environmental controls (n = 27) were processed in parallel. 16S rDNA gene quantitative PCR was used to calculate the bacterial load in each site. Bacteria were characterized by site using principal coordinate analysis of metagenomics data. BRiSK data were analyzed for presence of fungi and viruses. RESULTS. Corynebacteria, Propionibacteria, and coagulase-negative Staphylococci were the predominant organisms identified by all three techniques. Quantitative 16S PCR demonstrated approximately 0.1 bacterial 16S rDNA/human actin copy on the ocular surface compared with greater than 10 16S rDNA/human actin copy for facial skin or the buccal mucosa. The conjunctival bacterial community structure is distinct compared with the facial skin (R = 0.474, analysis of similarities P = 0.0001), the buccal mucosa (R = 0.893, P = 0.0001), and environmental control samples (R = 0.536, P = 0.0001). 16S metagenomics revealed substantially more bacterial diversity on the ocular surface than other techniques, which appears to be artifactual. BRiSK revealed presence of torque teno virus (TTV) on the healthy ocular surface, which was confirmed by direct PCR to be present in 65% of all conjunctiva samples tested. CONCLUSIONS. Relative to adjacent skin or other mucosa, healthy ocular surface microbiome is paucibacterial. Its flora are distinct from adjacent skin. Torque teno virus is a frequent constituent of the ocular surface microbiome. (ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02298881.). © 2016, Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology Inc.

AB  - Recent studies have established that the human urine contains a complex microbiome, including a virome about which little is known. Following immunosuppression in kidney transplant patients, BK polyomavirus (BKV) has been shown to induce nephropathy (BKVN), decreasing graft survival. In this study we investigated the urine virome profile of BKV+ and BKVâ ' kidney transplant recipients. Virus-like particles were stained to confirm the presence of VLP in the urine samples. Metagenomic DNA was purified, and the virome profile was analyzed using metagenomic shotgun sequencing. While the BK virus was predominant in the BKV+ group, it was also found in the BKVâ ' group patients. Additional viruses were also detected in all patients, notably including JC virus (JCV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) and interestingly, we detected multiple subtypes of the BKV, JCV and TTV. Analysis of the BKV subtypes showed that nucleotide polymorphisms were detected in the VP1, VP2 and Large T Antigen proteins, suggesting potential functional effects for enhanced pathogenicity. Our results demonstrate a complex urinary virome in kidney transplant patients with multiple viruses with several distinct subtypes warranting further analysis of virus subtypes in immunosuppressed hosts. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Acute encephalitis/encephalopathy is a severe neurological syndrome that is occasionally associated with viral infection. Comprehensive virus detection assays are desirable because viral pathogens have not been identified in many cases. We evaluated the utility of next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detecting viruses in clinical samples of encephalitis/encephalopathy patients. We first determined the sensitivity and quantitative performance of NGS by comparing the NGS-determined number of sequences of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) in clinical serum samples with the HHV-6 load measured using real-time PCR. HHV-6 was measured as it occasionally causes neurologic disorders in children. The sensitivity of NGS for detection of HHV-6 sequences was equivalent to that of real-time PCR, and the number of HHV-6 reads was significantly correlated with HHV-6 load. Next, we investigated the ability of NGS to detect viral sequences in 18 pediatric patients with acute encephalitis/encephalopathy of unknown etiology. A large number of Coxsackievirus A9 and mumps viral sequences were detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of 2 and 1 patients, respectively. In addition, Torque teno virus and Pepper mild mottle viral sequences were detected in the sera of one patient each. These data indicate that NGS is useful for detection of causative viruses in patients with pediatric encephalitis/encephalopathy. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - While recent findings suggest that swine TTVs (TTSuVs) can act as primary or co-infecting pathogens, very little is known about viral immunity. To determine whether TTSuVs downregulate key host immune responses to facilitate their own survival, a swine macrophage cell line, 3D4/31, was used to over-express recombinant TTSuV1 viral particles or the ORF3 protein. Immune gene expression profiles were assessed by a quantitative PCR panel consisting of 22 immune genes, in cell samples collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-transfection. Despite the upregulation of IFN-β and TLR9, interferon stimulated innate genes and pro-inflammatory genes were not upregulated in virally infected cells. The adaptive immune genes, IL-4 and IL-13, were significantly downregulated at 6 h post-transfection.

AB  - Torque Teno viruses (TTVs) are small DNA viruses which are ubiquitous in nature. Recent reports indicate that swine torque teno viruses (TTSuVs) can act as primary pathogens or play a role in exacerbating co-infections. However, very little is known about the TTSuV host-viral interaction or how they so successfully establish chronic infections in the host. To determine whether the major viral proteins can modulate host immunity, recombinant TTSuV1 ORF1 and 2 proteins were expressed in a swine macrophage cell line (3D4/31). The differential expression of a panel of innate, adaptive, regulatory and inflammatory immune genes was studied by quantitative PCR; using cDNA samples collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 h post-transfection. The ORF1 protein induced an early anti-viral response. However, at 6 h post-transfection it also upregulated IL-10, PD-1 and SOCS-1, the suppressors of T cell mediated immunity. An ensuing diminishment of the early protective response was noted. The TTSuV1 ORF2 protein suppressed IFN-β and IL-13 responses but did not significantly influence anti-viral immunity otherwise. These findings indicate that the TTSuV1 ORF1 protein plays a significant but dual role in viral immunity. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Aim of this study was the retrospective investigation of viral (porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), torque teno sus virus type 1 and 2 (TTSuV1, TTSuV2)) and bacterial (Bordetella bronchiseptica (B. b.), Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. h.), and Pasteurella multocida (P. m.)) co-infections in 110 Pneumocystis spp. positive lung samples of Austrian pigs with pneumonia. Fifty-one % were positive for PCV2, 7% for PRRSV, 22% for TTSuV1, 48% for TTSuV2, 6% for B. b., 29% for M. h., and 21% for P. m. In 38.2% only viral, in 3.6% only bacterial and in 40.0% both, viral and bacterial pathogens were detected. In 29.1% of the cases a co-infection with 1 pathogen, in 28.2% with 2, in 17.3% with 3, and in 7.3% with 4 different infectious agents were observed. The exposure to Pneumocystis significantly decreased the risk of a co-infection with PRRSV in weaning piglets; all other odds ratios were not significant. Four categories of results were compared: I = P. spp. + only viral co-infectants, II = P. spp. + both viral and bacterial co-infectants, III = P. spp. + only bacterial co-infectants, and IV = P. spp. single infection. The evaluation of all samples and the age class of the weaning piglets resulted in a predomination of the categories I and II. In contrast, the suckling piglets showed more samples of category I and IV. In the group of fattening pigs, category II predominated. Suckling piglets can be infected with P. spp. early in life. With increasing age this single infections can be complicated by co-infections with other respiratory diseases. © 2016 Weissenbacher-Lang et al.

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) is the most abundant component of human virome. Virologists have long ignored this orphan and highly divergent virus, in part because TTV cannot be cultured and because it lacks serology reagents and animal models. Nevertheless, it is almost endemic worldwide and is insensitive to current antiviral drugs, so its monitoring is useful in various conditions. To date, TTV as a marker has proved useful in at least two circumstances: to identify anthropogenic pollution and to assess functional immune competence in immunosuppressed individuals. This review summarizes recent findings about TTV and discusses the main hurdles in translating them into clinical diagnostics. © 2016 European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases

AB  - Torquetenovirus (TTV) is a widespread anellovirus that establishes persistent infections in human showing an increased viremia in immunosuppressed patients. TTV possesses microRNA (miRNA)-coding sequences that might be involved in viral immune evasion. Here, the presence of TTV DNA and miRNAs expression was investigated in plasma samples of 77 diseased (20 infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 18 infected with hepatitis B (HBV) virus, 18 infected with hepatitis C (HCV) virus, 21 solid organ transplanted) patients, and 25 healthy controls. TTV prevalence was significantly different in healthy controls (60%, 15/25) versus diseased patients (80%, 62/77), showing the highest TTV loads in transplant recipients. Genetic TTV analysis showed the highest prevalence of group 1, followed by groups 3, 4 and 5, and a lack of isolates of group 2. The expression of at least one TTV miRNAs of group 1, 3 and 5 was found in exosomes of plasma of the great majority of individuals (96%, 98/102 subjects) showing the higher prevalence of miRNAs of TTV group 3 (90%, 92/102), followed by miRNAs of group 1 (66%, 67/102), and miRNA of group 5 (49%, 50/102). TTV miRNAs expression and TTV viremia were not always directly correlated, and significant differences appeared in production of some TTV miRNAs between healthy controls and diseased patients. The reported TTV miRNAs status in exosomes encourages further investigation to understand their potential role in the expansion of anelloviruses upon immunosuppression. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recently a novel DNA virus (Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been identified in Japan and shown to be associated with elevated aminotransferase s levels after transfusion. However the exact role of TTV in pathogenesis of liver disease is yet to be established. The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of TTV in thalassemic patients and its relationship with elevated alanine-aminotransfrase (ALT) and aspartateaminotransfrase (AST). This cross-sectional analysis study was conducted on 452 thallasemic patients. Serums were collected from all of the patients, first ALT and AST levels were determined. Then, after DNA extraction, TTV DNA was amplified and detected using semi-nested PCR, followed by gel electrophoresis. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected from each participant for statistical analysis. The findings showed that 160 of 452 (35.4%) samples had TTV DNA detected by PCR. From 160 TTV DNA positive, 98 (61.20%) were female and 62 (38.80%) of them were male (P=0.549). The mean ALT and AST values in TTV positive group were higher than in TTV negative group, and the difference was statistically significant (p<0.0001). The result showed that the prevalence of TTV in thalassemic patients in Jahrom is less than other studies in Iran and the mean ALT and AST values in TTV positive individuals were about 2 times more than in TTV negative individuals.

AB  - A new species of torque teno mini virus, named TTMV-222, was detected in gingival tissue from periodontitis patients using a viral metagenomics method. The 2803-nucleotide genome of TTMV-222 is closely related to TTMV1-CBD279, with 62.6% overall nucleotide similarity. Genetic analyses of the new virus genome revealed a classic genomic organization but a weak identity with known sequences. The prevalence of TTMV-222 in the periodontitis group (n = 150) was significantly higher than that in the healthy group (n = 150) (p = 0.032), suggesting that the new virus may be associated with inflammation in chronic periodontitis patients. However, this finding requires further investigation.

AB  - Torque Teno Viruses (TTVs) are ubiquitous viruses which are highly prevalent in several mammalian species. Human TTV's are epidemiologically associated with several human disease conditions such as respiratory illnesses, auto-immune disorders and hepatitis. Recently it was found that swine TTV's (TTSuVs) can act as primary pathogens. The common occurrence of TTVs as environmental contaminants and the increasing interest in the use of swine organs for xenotransplantation lend importance to the question of whether TTV's can cross-infect across species. In this study, we examined human and swine sera by swine or human TTV-specific PCRs, to determine whether swine TTVs (TTSuV) DNA can be detected in humans and vice versa. Surprisingly, both human and TTSuV DNA were present in a majority of the samples tested. Transfection of human PBMC's with TTSuV1 genomic DNA resulted in productive viral infection which was sustained for the three serial passages tested. Lymphoproliferative responses in infected human PBMCs were diminished when compared to the controls. Furthermore, mild to moderate antibody responses against the TTSuV1 ORF2 protein was detected in 16 of the 40 human sera by ELISA. Therefore, these study findings provide initial and fundamental evidence for possible cross-species transmission of TTVs.

AB  - Background and objectives: Ross River virus (RRV) is an enveloped, RNA alphavirus in the same antigenic group as chikungunya virus. Australia records an annual average of 5000 laboratory-confirmed RRV infections. While RRV is currently geographically restricted to the Western Pacific, the capacity of arboviruses for rapid expansion is well established. The first case of RRV transfusion-transmission was recently described prompting a comprehensive risk assessment. Materials and methods: To estimate the RRV residual risk, we applied laboratory-confirmed RRV notifications to two published models. This modelling generated point estimates for the risk of viraemia in the donor population, the risk of collecting a viraemic donation and the predicted number of infected components. Results: The EUFRAT model estimated the risk of infection in donors as one in 95 039 (one in 311 328 to one in 32 399) to one in 14 943 (one in 48 593 to one in 5094). The point estimate for collecting a RRV viraemic donation varied from one in 166 486 (one in 659 078 to one in 49 158) (annualized national risk) to one in 26 117 (one in 103 628 to one in 7729) (area of high transmission). The modelling predicted 8-11 RRV-infected labile blood components issued in Australia during a 1-year period. Conclusion: Considering the uncertainty in the modelled estimates, the unknown rate of RRV donor viraemia and the low severity of any recipient RRV infection, additional risk management for RRV in Australia will initially be restricted to strengthening the messaging to donors regarding prompt reporting of any postdonation illnesses. © 2016 International Society of Blood Transfusion.

AB  - Context: Data regarding the distribution of Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-E alleles and their association with blood-borne pathogen infections/co-infections are limited for many populations, including Indonesia. Aims: The aim of this study was to analyze the association between HLA-E allelic variants and infection with blood-borne pathogens such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), torque teno virus (TTV), GB virus C (GBV-C), and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) in Indonesian Javanese human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients. Settings and Design: A total of 320 anti-HIV-positive blood samples were analyzed for HBV, HCV, HDV, TTV, GBV-C, and T. gondii infection status and its association with HLA-E allelic variants. Materials and Methods: Nucleic acid was extracted from plasma samples and used for the molecular detection of HBV DNA, HCV RNA, HDV RNA, TTV DNA, and GBV-C RNA, whereas hepatitis B surface antigen, anti-HCV, immunoglobulin M and G (IgM and IgG) anti-T. gondii were detected through serological testing. The blood samples were genotyped for HLA-E loci using a sequence-specific primer-polymerase chain reaction. Statistical Analysis Used: Either the Chi-square or Fisher′s exact test was performed to analyze the frequency of HLA-E alleles and blood-borne pathogen infections in the population. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to measure the association between the antibodies found and the participants′ possible risk behaviors. A logistic regression analysis was used to assess the associations. Results: HLA-EFNx010101/0101 was associated with HCV/TTV co-infection (adjusted OR [aOR]: 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.156-10.734; P = 0.027) and IgM/IgG anti-Toxo positivity (aOR: 27.0; 95% CI: 3.626-200.472; P = 0.001). HLA-EFNx010103/0103 was associated with TTV co-infection (aOR: 2.7; 95% CI: 1.509-4.796; P = 0.001). Conclusions: HLA-E alleles in Indonesian Javanese HIV patients were found to be associated with HCV, TTV, and toxoplasma co-infections. © 2016 Journal of Global Infectious Diseases | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.

AB  - In addition to traditional risk factors such as smoking habits and alcohol consumption, certain microbes also play an important role in the generation of head and neck carcinomas. Infection with high-risk human papillomavirus types is strongly associated with the development of oropharyngeal carcinoma, and Epstein-Barr virus appears to be indispensable for the development of non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma of the nasopharynx. Other viruses including torque teno virus and hepatitis C virus may act as co-carcinogens, increasing the risk of malignant transformation. A shift in the composition of the oral microbiome was associated with the development of oral squamous cell carcinoma, although the causal or casual role of oral bacteria remains to be clarified. Conversion of ethanol to acetaldehyde, a mutagenic compound, by members of the oral microflora as well as by fungi including Candida albicans and others is a potential mechanism that may increase oral cancer risk. In addition, distinct Candida spp. also produce NBMA (N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine), a potent carcinogen. Inflammatory processes elicited by microbes may also facilitate tumorigenesis in the head and neck region. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus highly prevalent in the world. It has been detected in eastern Taiwan indigenes with a low prevalence of 11% by using N22 region of which known to underestimate TTV prevalence excessively. In order to clarify their realistic epidemiology, we re-analyzed TTV prevalence with UTR region. One hundred and forty serum samples from eastern Taiwanese indigenous population were collected and TTV DNA was detected in 133 (95%) samples. Direct sequencing revealed an extensive mix-infection of different TTV strains within the infected individual. Entire TTV open reading frame 1 was amplified and cloned from a TTV positive individual to distinguish mix-infected strains. Phylogenetic analysis showed eleven isolates were clustered into a monophyletic group that is distinct from all known groups. In addition, another our isolate was clustered with recently described Hebei-1 strain and formed an independent clade. Based on the distribution pattern of pairwise distances, both new clusters were placed at phylogenetic group level, designed as the 6th and 7th phylogenetic group. In present study, we showed a very high prevalence of TTV infection in eastern Taiwan indigenes and indentified new phylogenetic groups from the infected individual. Both intra- and inter-phylogenetic group mix-infections can be found from one healthy person. Our study has further broadened the field of human TTVs and proposed a robust criterion for classification of the major TTV phylogenetic groups. Copyright © 2016 Hsiao et al.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) has a non-enveloped, single-stranded, negative-sense circular DNA genome, and it is widely distributed in pigs. Open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of TTSuV1 can be transcribed into mRNA and then translated into protein; however, its promoter has not yet been identified. We used a dual-luciferase reporter system, involving pGL3-Basic and pRL-TK, to identify the promoter of TTSuV1 ORF1. Our results revealed that the sequence between nucleotides 196 and 525 promoted the transcription of the firefly luciferase gene. The core sequence of the promoter was between nucleotides 250 and 400. A comparison of the identified TTSuV1 ORF1 promoter with that from cytomegalovirus (CMV) suggested that the two promoters were similar in strength. Our findings provide new information regarding the molecular biology of TTSuV1 and have revealed a new promoter that can be used in plasmids for numerous applications. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1a/TTSuV1b) infection is present in pig herds worldwide. This study investigated the prevalence of TTSuV1a/TTSuV1b infections in domestic pigs from some slaughterhouses in Nigeria as well as coinfection with African swine fever virus (ASFV) and described the phylogeny in relation to global strains. One hundred and eighty-one (181) blood samples from four slaughterhouses were used for the study and viral nucleic acid detection was carried out by PCR. Comparative sequence analysis was carried out to infer phylogeny. The overall prevalence of TTSuV1a/b was 17.7%. Prevalence of individual genotypes was 10.5% and 7.2% for TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b, respectively. Coinfection of ASFV/TTSuV1a/b was 7.7% while that of TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b was 1.7%. ASFV alone was detected in 11.91% of the total samples. The Nigerian TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b shared a sequence identity of 91-100% and 95-100%, respectively, among each other. The ASFV sequences were 100% identical to members of genotype 1. This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV1a/b in domestic pigs in Nigeria and coinfection with ASFV. Although the prevalence of TTSuV1a/b in Nigeria was low, we recommend further studies to establish the trend and possible role in the pathogenesis of ASFV. © 2016 Pam D. Luka et al.

AB  - Anelloviridae family is comprised of small, non-enveloped viruses of various genome lengths, high sequence diversity, sharing the same genome organization. Infections and co-infections by different genotypes in humans are ubiquitous. Related viruses were described in number of mammalian hosts, but very limited data are available from the closest human relatives - great apes and non-human primates.Here we report the 100% prevalence determined by semi-nested PCR from fecal samples of 16 captive primate species. Only the Mandrillus sphinx, showed the prevalence only 8%. We describe three new species of gorillas[U+05F3] and four new species of chimpanzees[U+05F3] Betatorqueviruses and their co-infections in one individual. This study is also first report and analysis of nearly full length TTMV genomes infecting gorillas. Our attempts to sequence the complete genomes of anelloviruses from host feces invariably failed. Broader usage of blood /tissue material is necessary to understand the diversity and interspecies transmission of anelloviruses. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: SEN virus (SENV) is the latest virus proposed as a cause of unknown hepatitis cases. Among nine detected genotypes of the virus, genotypes D and H are more frequent in hepatitis cases of unknown origin. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes in the sera of healthy individuals and hepatitis B and C patients. Methods: Totally, 200 serum samples from healthy individuals as well as 50 hepatitis B and 50 hepatitis C patients were collected. Anti-HCV (hepatitis C virus), anti-human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen and anti-HBV (hepatitis B virus) core antigen were detected, and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were measured. Viral DNA was subjected to nested PCR. Fisher's exact and unpaired ANOVA tests were used for statistical analyses. Results: SENV was detected in 90%, 66%, and 46% of the healthy individuals HBV and HCV-positive individuals, respectively. The frequency of SENV and its two genotypes were significantly lower in hepatitis B and hepatitis C patients (P<0.01). Also, the frequency of SENV-H was higher than SENV-D in all studied groups. In SENV-positive HBV patients, the level of ALT and AST enzymes were significantly less than SENV-negative patients (P<0.05). It was the same for SENV-H-negative and -positive cases. Conclusions: The levels of liver enzymes were significantly lower in HBV patients co-infected with SENV compared to HBV patients (P<0.05), indicating a positive impact of the virus in liver pathology by decreasing liver damage and thus decreasing the liver enzymes. © 2016, Pasteur Institute of Iran.

AB  - Objective: The objective was to study the serological prevalence of post-transfusion transmitted infections such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and HIV among multi-transfused thalassemic individuals of the Eastern India and the socio and financial difficulties faced by them. Methods: The study was carried out from January 2012 until December 2014 involving 1711 thalassemic major individuals. Blood serum was collected from each patient to perform ELISA for the detection of HBV and HCV seroprevalence. HIV seropositivity along with their hematological and liver function parameters were obtained from the transfusion centers and the host institutions. Other socio-economic conditions were obtained by predesigned proforma of the questionnaire. Results: 67.9% males and 32.1% females were present in our study population of which 75% were from rural area. The mean hemoglobin was found to be lower, whereas mean ferritin, bilirubin, and liver enzymes were much higher than the normal range. Only a handful of 19.76% of the fathers of thalassemic individuals had secondary education. 263 families (15.37%) were familiar with the chances of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). The dominant TTI found within the population was HCV with 18.70% prevalence followed by HIV (3.74%) and HBV (3.33%). 82.93% of the affected families suffered poverty with a meager monthly income within Rs. 5000 fighting against high costs of transfusion and related treatments. Conclusion: Our study reflects the different socio-economic and psychological burdens faced by the thalassemia patients and their families. The high rate of TTIs highlights the need for stringent screening of blood or blood products before administration. © 2016, Asian Journal of Pharmaceutical and Clinical Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Thin silicon (Si) wafers with thickness of 100-140. μm were obtained by using a multi-wire slicing process with a SiC slurry. We investigated the process yields of wafer slicing as well as physical/electrical properties of the sliced wafers with various thicknesses. As the wafer thickness decreases, the process yield abruptly decreased due to wafer breakage during the slicing process, and conventional polishing the brick surface was not enough to gain a considerable process yield. However, elimination of defects on the brick surface by mirror polishing resulted in an 83.1% enhancement of yield even for wafers with a thickness of 100. μm. The number of wafers obtained was even higher than that of conventional 180. μm-thick wafers (479 vs. 415 wafers in this research). Investigation of the microstructure of brick surfaces revealed that surface defects on bricks were main parameter to determine the yield of slicing process. Surface defects containing the micro-cracks introduced residual stress, which decreased the slicing process yield especially for thinner wafers. From measurements of physical and electrical properties, it was revealed that the relative total thickness variations (TTVs) and bowings increased and the characteristic fracture strength of sliced wafer and conversion efficiencies decreased as the wafer thickness decreased. For the wafer with thickness of 100. μm, the relative TTV and bowing were 14.1% and 22.5. mm, respectively. The conversion efficiency of a solar cell using this wafer was 17.6%, while that of a conventional Si solar cell using a 180. μm-thick wafer was 18.4%. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Background: Torque Teno Midi Virus/Small Anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the Gammatorquevirus genus within the family Anelloviridae. It is detected in healthy, Hepatitis B Virus, Hepatitis C Virus and HIV infected individuals and also patients with acute respiratory disease in different countries, but its role in clinical diseases and its full geographical distribution is still unclear. Objectives: The current study aimed to detect the frequency of infection with TTMDV/SAV in the sera of healthy blood donors, hepatitis C infected and HIV positive individuals in Lorestan province, Iran; and also investigate the possible role of TTMDV/SAV virus in liver diseases. Materials and Methods: Fifty two, 36, 4, and 110 serum samples from HIV positive, patients with HIV/HCV and HIV/HCV/HBV co-infections, and healthy individuals were collected in Khorramabad city, respectively. Nested-polymerase chain reaction was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers to detect TTMDV/SAV DNA. Serum aminotransferases were measured. Results: In the HIV/HCV, HIV/HCV/HBV, HIV, and control cases, 29 (80.5%), 3 (75%), 43 (82.7%), and 16 (14.5%) were positive for DNA of TTMDV/SAV, respectively. In the HIV/HCV infected cases and HIV positive cases the level of Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were not significantly different in TTMDV/SAV infected and non-infected individuals (P > 0.05). Conclusions: Although significant differences (P < 0.01) were observed in the frequency of TTMDV/SAV between healthy controls and each of the HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected individuals, no significant difference was observed between HIV positive and HIV/HCV co-infected cases, which may be due to HIV associated immunodeficiency. This is the first time that TTMDV/SAV is reported in HIV infected individuals worldwide. Interpretation of the high frequency of the virus (82.7%) in HIV cases needs more detailed studies. © 2015, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.

The present study intended to evaluate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV based on its correlations with the histopathological changes, various common concurrently infected viral pathogens including porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), and porcine parvovirus (PPV), as well as changes in the distribution and population of host immunocytes such as B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages by using the superficial inguinal lymph nodes (siLNs) of wasting pigs. A tissue microarray consisting of 270 available siLNs collected from 262 clinically wasting and 8 healthy pigs, respectively, were used for the detection of TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PCV2, PRRSV, and PPV by either in situ hybridization (ISH) or immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and for the detection of various subsets of immunocytes by IHC staining with monoclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79a, and lysozyme. The slides were then subject to digital scanning followed by a semi-quantitative positive pixel evaluation for further statistical analysis. Although a high prevalence of TTSuV1 and/or TTSuV2 infection was noted in both wasting and healthy pigs, the wasting pigs had a significantly higher intensity in both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 ISH-positive signals than healthy ones did. In the wasting pigs, a significant positive correlation in the tissue viral load was noted between TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 and between TTSuV2 and PCV2, but not between TTSuV1 and PCV2. Conversely, a significant negative correlation in the tissue viral load was revealed between TTSuV2, but not TTSuV1, and PRRSV. The tissue viral load of TTSuV1 was significantly correlated with B cell hyperplasia, while the tissue viral load of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated with increased macrophage population. The ISH positivity of TTSuV2 was significantly correlated with lymphoid depletion and granulomatous inflammation, which are the characteristic histopathological findings in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected pigs. These findings suggest that both TTSuV species may have the potential involving the development of porcine circovirus-associated lymphoid lesions via alternating the host immune system. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a small virus belongs to Anelloviridea family. TTV is a disease orphan virus but it has often been associated with a variety of pathologies and co-infections. TTV was recently identified as an infectious agent that could potentially be involved in cases of acute enteritis. Objectives: To ascertain the presence of TTV in stools from diarrheic and not diarrheic people, and to investigate an association between infection, and patient age and gender. Study design: Stool samples from people exhibiting signs of enteritis (954) and from non-diarrheic individuals (76) were collected in the former Chinook Health Region (CHR) in Southwestern Alberta, Canada from May 2008 to April 2009. Viral genetic material was extracted, and detection and quantification of TTV were carried out by real-time PCR. The presence of other viral and bacterial enteric pathogens was also investigated. Results: More (P&lt;0.001) diarrheic people (38.8%) tested positive for TTV DNA than non-diarrheic individuals (18.4%). Furthermore, viral load was greater (P&lt;0.001) in stools from diarrheic (2.0×107copies/g) than non-diarrheic (2.0×103copies/g) people. TTV DNA was detected most often in diarrheic individuals that were 0-5 (57.3%) and greater than 81 (59.0%) years of age. Combined across age, the prevalence of TTV was higher among men than women (P=0.003). Co-infections with other enteric pathogens were observed. Conclusions: This study revealed a significant association between TTV prevalence and viral load, and enteritis. Also, TTV prevalence was significantly higher in the very young and elderly suggesting that immunological status is important. © 2015.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that was identified in patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of non-A-to-G type. Patients with chronic renal failure on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have a higher risk of viral infections, and the prevalence of TTV infection is common. The aim of our study was to detect TTV-DNA and its genotype in HD patients. A case-control study compromising of 63 patients on maintenance HD therapy at the Nephrology Center of Central Arar Hospital and 100 healthy individuals who were tested for TTVDNA and its genotype by semi nested-polymerase chain reaction with primers derived from the conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region followed by digestion with NdeI and PstI restriction enzyme. The results show that the prevalence of TTV in HD patients was high and statistically significant; 42.9% compared with 19% in the control group. History of blood transfusion was the only significant predictor, and we found that age of patients, duration of HD, hepatitis B and C infection, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase levels were not significant predictors of TT virus positivity in HD patients. TTV genotype 1 (G1) was found to be the most common genotype among both HD and healthy controls. The prevalence of TTV among HD patients was significantly higher than that in healthy individuals. History of blood transfusion was the only significant predictor of TTV positivity among them. Genotype 1 was the most predominant type among HD and healthy individuals. Further studies on TTV in peritoneal dialysis patients and transplant patients are needed.

AB  - Viral infections are important contributors to exacerbation of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; however, the role of viruses in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is less clear. This likely reflects that fact that IPF acute exacerbations are defined clinically as "noninfectious, " and little attention has been paid to the outcomes of patients with IPF with diagnosed infections. However, accumulating evidence suggests that infections (both bacterial and viral) may influence disease outcomes either as exacerbating agents or initiators of disease. Support for a viral role in disease initiation comes from studies demonstrating the presence of herpesviral DNA and epithelial cell stress in the lungs of asymptomatic relatives at risk for developing familial IPF. In addition, the number of studies that can associate viral (especially herpesviral) signatures in the lung with the development of IPF is steadily growing, and activated leukocyte signatures in patients with IPF provide further support for infectious processes driving IPF progression. Animal modeling has been used to better understand how a gammaherpesvirus infection can modulate the pathogenesis of lung fibrosis and has demonstrated that preceding infections appear to reprogram lung epithelial cells during latency to produce profibrotic factors, making the lung more susceptible to subsequent fibrotic insult, whereas exacerbations of existing fibrosis, or infections in susceptible hosts, involve active viral replication and are influenced by antiviral therapy. In addition, there is new evidence that bacterial burden in the lungs of patients with IPF may predict a poor prognosis. © 2015 by the American Thoracic Society.

AB  - Background: Abnormally high levels of T-cell activation can persist in HIV-infected subjects despite effective anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and has been associated with negative health outcomes. The nature of the antigenic drivers or other causes of this residual T-cell activation remain uncertain. Anelloviruses are universally acquired soon after birth, resulting in persistent viremia, and considered part of the commensal human virome. Reduced immunocompetence results in increased anellovirus levels. Objectives: To test whether increased levels of anelloviruses or other viruses in plasma are associated with higher levels of persistent T-cell activation during ART. Study design: Two amplification methods combined with next generation sequencing were used to detect all viruses and estimate relative anellovirus levels in plasma from 19 adults on effective ART who exhibited a wide range of T-cell activation levels. Results: Nucleic acids from HBV and HCV were detected in one patient each while pegivirus A (GBV-C) was found in three patients. Anellovirus DNA was detected in all patients with some individuals carrying up to eight different genotypes. Specific anellovirus genotypes or higher level of co-infections were not detected in subjects with higher levels of T-cell activation. No association was detected between relative plasma anellovirus DNA levels and the percentage of activated CD4 or CD8 T cells. Conclusions: Human anelloviruses were detected in all HIV suppressed subjects, exhibited a wide range of viremia levels, and were genetically highly diverse. The level of persistent T-cell activation was not correlated with the level of viremia or genotypes present indicating that anellovirus antigens are unlikely to be a dominant source of antigens driving chronic T-cell activation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV, family Anelloviridae) cause long lasting and persistent infection in pigs under subclinical scenarios, and are potentially linked to several economically important swine diseases. Currently, little is known about swine immune response against TTSuV infections. In this study, an ELISA assay was developed based on the ORF1-A recombinant protein of two known TTSuVs, namely TTSuV1 (genus Iotatorquevirus) and TTSuV2 (genus Kappatorquevirus). The assay was used to study the development of the humoral immune response against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in longitudinally sampled clinically healthy pigs and their dams. Anti ORF1-A IgG was found in serum of pigs and sows for both TTSuVs. From 15 sows, 15 (100%) and 13 (83%) had anti ORF1-A IgG against TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. Pig sero-prevalences at the first sampling (4 weeks of age) were 65% (24/37) and 5% (2/37) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, respectively. For TTSuV1, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at weeks 21 and 25, with 68% (25/37) sero-positive pigs. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) results at week 21 revealed that 26 out of 32 (81%) pigs were positive for TTSuV1. In the case of TTSuV2, the highest anti ORF1-A IgG prevalence was observed at week 21, with 84% (31/37) pigs being sero-positive. At the same week, 92% (34/37) of pigs were qPCR positive. In summary, anti ORF1-A IgGs were detected in both sows and piglets at different ages, indicating that these animals could mount a humoral immune response against both TTSuVs. However, the high percentage of viremic pigs in presence of anti ORF1-A IgG suggests that these antibodies are not able to remove TTSuVs from circulation. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Transfusion Transmitted Virus (TTV), also known as Torque Teno Virus is a new novel viral agent which appears to correlate with some acute and chronic hepatitis cases and may produce liver damage under specific circumstances. Aim of this study was to detect TT virus by real-time PCR, study its clinical implications and effects of its co-infection in HBV and HCV chronic liver diseases. Methods: The study population comprised 50 acute hepatitis, 50 chronic hepatitis patients and 100 voluntary blood donors. All samples were tested for serum bilirubin, AST, ALT and alkaline phosphatase levels and for all available viral markers for hepatitis. The detection of TT viral genome was carried out by real-time PCR using TTV sequences as reported by Takahashi et al with modifications on the basis of database of the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (GenBank accession no. AB008394). Result: Serum was positive for TTV in 72% of volunteer blood donors, 77.4% (24/31) of hepatitis A cases, 87.6% (36/41) of HBV-positive, 77% (10/13) of HCV-positive, and 92.8% (13/14) of non-B, non-C cases. Co-infection of TTV with other hepatitis viruses was detected in some patients. Conclusion: TTV is a frequent virus detected in patients with various types of viral hepatitis, in cases of hepatitis without obvious viral agent, and from the healthy population in India. Rate of TTV was found to be significantly higher (92.8%) for Non A-E hepatitis group. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Director General, Armed Forces Medical Services.

AB  - Background: Cirrhosis is one of the most severe liver complications, with multiple etiologies. The torque teno virus (TTV), also known as transfusion transmitted virus, which has a high incidence in the world population, is one of the possible increasing risk factors in patients with idiopathic fulminant hepatitis and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate solitary and co-infection with TTV, in patients with cryptogenic and determined cause of cirrhosis. Patients and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, 200 liver transplant patients were consecutively recruited between years 2007 and 2011. Patients were classified, based on recognition of the etiology of cirrhosis to determined (n = 81) and cryptogenic (n = 119) patient groups. The existence of TTV infection was analyzed, using a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction method. The presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infective markers, including HBV DNA, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb), and hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb), was evaluated using qualitative polymerase chain reaction and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay protocols, respectively. Results: The TTV infection was found in 37 of 200 (18.5%) and 53 of 200 (26.5%) plasma and tissue samples of studied liver transplanted patients, respectively. The TTV genomic DNA was found in 32 (26.9%) and 28 (23.5%) of 119 liver tissue and plasma samples of transplanted patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis, respectively. The genomic DNA of TTV was also diagnosed in 21 (25.9%) and nine (11.1%) of the 81 liver tissue and plasma samples of patients with determined cirrhosis, respectively. Significant associations were found between TTV infection with HBV molecular and immunologic infective markers, in liver transplanted patients, with determined and cryptogenic cirrhosis. Conclusions: The diagnosis of the high frequency of solitary TTV and co-infection with HBV, in both liver transplanted patients with cryptogenic and determined cirrhosis, emphasized on the importance of TTV infection in the development of cirrhosis, especially in the cases of cryptogenic ones, prompting for further studies the confirm this agent in the etiology of determined cirrhosis. © 2015, Kowsar Corp.

AB  - We determined the complete genome sequences of torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) detected in pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and in healthy pigs in Japan. Unexpectedly, we found coinfection of a PMWS-affected pig in Japan with one strain of TTSuV1, five strains of TTSuV2, and one strain of PCV2. Full-genome sequencing of each of these strains, followed by phylogenetic analysis, revealed broad genetic diversity in the TTSuV2 strains infecting the PMWS-affected pig. These results suggest that the geographical bias in the available genetic information about TTSuVs has a limited impact on the evaluation of their genetic diversity. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV) was the first human Anelloviridae detected in a Japanese patient with an unknown type of hepatitis in 1997. TTV is by far the first known single-stranded circular DNA virus infecting human. In spite of its widespread nature in human population, its pathogenesis is still unclear. In addition, information regarding TTV infection in Iranian population is limited. Therefore, we attempted to determine the prevalence and genotype of TTV in three groups: HIV/HBV patients, chronic hepatitis B patients, and healthy individuals. Methods: The presence of TTV DNA in sera was investigated using PCR. The primer sets encompassing two 5΄-UTR and N22 regions were used, and the positive products were collected for sequencing. Phylogenetic tree was generated based on N22 region and using the MEGA 7 software. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 452 patients with HIV/HBV and chronic hepatitis B, as well as in healthy control groups. The results from PCR indicated positive rates for these three groups, 48%, 54%, and 49.3% using 5΄-UTR primer and 15.1%, 12%, and 8% using N22 primer, respectively. Conclusion: Five genogroups were observed, which the second group was found to be the most frequent. The results of 5΄-UTR primer showed more prevalence of TTV DNA comparing to N22 primer in patients and healthy control. © 2015, Pasteur Institute of Iran. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the correlation between Torque teno sus virus 1b (TTSuV1b) infection and other viral infections or vaccine immunization in conventional pigs. Methods: With overexpressed and purified viral protein TTSuV1b as antigen, an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method for detecting TTSuV1b antibody was established, which demonstrated great specificity and reproducibility. Porcine serum samples (n = 212) were tested using ELISA. Meanwhile, the antibodies against Classical Swine Fever Virus (CSFV), Pseudorabies Virus (PRV), Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV), and Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2) were also examined using the commercial kits. Results: Statistical analysis indicated that the level of anti-TTSuV1b antibody was positively correlated with the level of anti-PCV2 antibody in a lesser extent; the level of antibodies against TTSuV1b or PCV2 were significantly lower in porcine serum with low level of TTSuV1b virus, implicating the potential consistency and synchronization in the mechanism of TTSuV1b and PCV2 infection. Whereas, antibodies against PRRSV or CSFV showed no statistical significance on comparison with anti-TTSuV1b antibody, implicating that in conventional pigs, the antibody level for PRRSV and CSFV were not significantly influenced by TTSuV1b infection. Conclusion: In conclusion, examination of anti-TTSuV1b antibody in porcine serum with the presently established ELISA method would serve as a supplementary approach for etiological investigation, and the combined statistical analysis of the antibodies against four other viruses might help to further understand the TTSuV1b infection as well as its pathogenicity. © 2015 Li et al.

AB  - This study investigated the disease status of Saskatchewan's feral wild boar population. Whole carcasses, tissue samples, and/or serum from 81 hunter-killed boars from Saskatchewan were submitted to the Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) between 2009 and 2014. Serological tests were negative for PRRS, H1N1, and H3N2 swine influenza, PCV-2, and TGE/PRCV in 22/22 boars and for Toxoplasma gondii and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae in 20/20 boars. Of 20 boars whose sera were tested 20 were positive for Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, with 7 positive for, among other strains, serotype 14; 16 were positive for Lawsonia intracellularis, 1 was positive and 6 were suspicious for Salmonella spp. Polymerase chain reaction tests were negative for PRRS and PCV2 in 58/58 boars and positive for Torque teno virus in 1/8 boars. Digestion assays were negative for Trichinella spp. in 22/22 boars. The high seroprevalence of A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 14 is noteworthy as this serotype has not been previously reported in North America.
Risques de maladie associés au sanglier en liberté en Saskatchewan. Cette étude a examiné l’état des maladies de la population de sangliers féraux de la Saskatchewan. Des carcasses entières, des échantillons de tissus et/ou du sérum provenant de 81 sangliers tués par des chasseurs de la Saskatchewan ont été soumis à la Canadian Wildlife Health Cooperative (CWHC) entre 2009 et 2014. Les tests sérologiques étaient négatifs pour SRRP, l’influenza porcine H1N1 et H3N2, CVP-2 et GET/CVRP chez 22/22 sangliers et pour Toxoplasma gondii et Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae chez 20/20 sangliers. Parmi les 20 sangliers dont le sérum a été analysé, 20 présentaient des résultats positifs pour Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, et sept étaient positifs pour le sérotype 14, entre autres souches; 16 étaient positifs pour Lawsonia intracellularis, un était positif et six étaient suspectés pour Salmonella spp. Des tests d’amplification en chaîne par la polymérase ont été négatifs pour SRRP et CVP2 chez 58/58 sangliers et positifs pour le virus torque teno chez 1/8 des sangliers. Des épreuves de digestion ont été négatives pour Trichinella spp. chez 22/22 sangliers. La séroprévalence élevée du sérotype A. pleuropneumoniae 14 mérite d’être signalée car ce sérotype n’a pas été signalé antérieurement en Amérique du Nord.(Traduit par Isabelle Vallières).

AB  - Infection with Torque teno viruses (TTVs) is not restricted to humans. Different domestic and wild animal species are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs worldwide. Due to the global spread of the infection, it is likely that essentially all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and that co-evolution of TTVs with their hosts probably occurred. Although TTVs are potentially related to many diseases, the evidence of the widespread infection in healthy human and nonhuman hosts raised doubts about their pathogenic potential. Nonetheless, their role as superimposed agents of other diseases or as triggers for impairment of immune surveillance is currently under debate. The possible contribution of animal TT viruses to interspecies transmission and their role as zoonotic agents are currently topics of discussion. © 2015 Manzin et al.

AB  - Porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4) is a DNA virus, and a member of the Parvoviridae family within the Bocavirus genera. It was detected recently in swine, but its epidemiology and pathology remain unclear. A TaqMan-based real-time PCR (qPCR) targeting a conserved region of the ORF3 gene of PPV4 was developed. The qPCR detection limit was 9.5×101 DNA copies/μL. There was no cross-reaction with porcine parvovirus, torque teno virus 1, torque teno virus 2, porcine circovirus type 1, porcine circovirus type 2, or with pseudorabies virus. Two hundred and seventy-two samples, including serum, semen, lungs, feces, ovarian follicular fluids, ovaries and uterus, were evaluated by qPCR and PPV4 was detected in 36 samples (13.2%). When compared with a conventional PCR (cPCR), the qPCR assay was 10 times more sensitive and the detection of PPV4 DNA in field samples was increased 2.5 times. Partial sequencing of PPV4 ORF3 gene, obtained from two pooled samples of uterus and ovaries, revealed a high nucleotide identity (98-99%) with a reference PPV4 sequence. The qPCR can be used as a fast and accurate assay for the detection and quantification of PPV4 in field samples and for epidemiological studies in swine herds. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Purpose: Compressed sensing is a technique used to accelerate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition without compromising image quality. While it has proven particularly useful in dynamic imaging procedures such as cardiac cine, very few authors have applied it to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The purpose of the present study was to check whether the prior image constrained compressed sensing (PICCS) algorithm, which is based on an available prior image, can improve the statistical maps in fMRI better than other strategies that also exploit temporal redundancy. Methods: PICCS was compared to spatiotemporal total variation (TTV) and k-t FASTER, since they have already demonstrated high performance and robustness in other MRI applications, such as cardiac cine MRI and resting state fMRI, respectively. The prior image for PICCS was the average of all undersampled data. Both PICCS and TTV were solved using the split Bregman formulation. K-t FASTER algorithm relies on matrix completion to reconstruct the undersampled k-spaces. The three algorithms were evaluated using two datasets with high and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)- BOLD contrast-acquired in a 7 T preclinical MRI scanner and retrospectively undersampled at various rates (i.e., acceleration factors). The authors evaluated their performance in terms of the sensitivity/specificity of BOLD detection through receiver operating characteristic curves and by visual inspection of the statistical maps. Results: With high SNR studies, PICCS performed similarly to the state-of-the-art algorithms TTV and k-t FASTER and provided consistent BOLD signal at the ROI. In scenarios with low SNR and high acceleration factors, PICCS still provided consistent maps and higher sensitivity/specificity than TTV, whereas k-t FASTER failed to provide significant maps. Conclusions: The authors performed a comparison between three reconstructions (PICCS, TTV, and k-t FASTER) that exploit temporal redundancy in fMRI. The prior-based algorithm, PICCS, preserved BOLD activation and sensitivity/specificity better than TTV and k-t FASTER in noisy scenarios. The PICCS algorithm can potentially reach an acceleration factor of ×8 and still provide BOLD contrast in the ROI with an area under the curve over 0.99. © 2015 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

AB  - Pathogen detection and the identification of fecal contamination sources are challenging in environmental waters. Factors including pathogen diversity and ubiquity of fecal indicator bacteria hamper risk assessment and remediation of contamination sources. A custom microarray targeting pathogens (viruses, bacteria, protozoa), microbial source tracking (MST) markers, and antibiotic resistance genes was tested against DNA obtained from whole genome amplification (WGA) of RNA and DNA from sewage and animal (avian, cattle, poultry, and swine) feces. Perfect and mismatch probes established the specificity of the microarray in sewage, and fluorescence decrease of positive probes over a 1:10 dilution series demonstrated semiquantitative measurement. Pathogens, including norovirus, Campylobacter fetus, Helicobacter pylori, Salmonella enterica, and Giardia lamblia were detected in sewage, as well as MST markers and resistance genes to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, and tetracycline. Sensitivity (percentage true positives) of MST results in sewage and animal waste samples (21-33%) was lower than specificity (83-90%, percentage of true negatives). Next generation DNA sequencing revealed two dominant bacterial families that were common to all sample types: Ruminococcaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Five dominant phyla and 15 dominant families comprised 97% and 74%, respectively, of sequences from all fecal sources. Phyla and families not represented on the microarray are possible candidates for inclusion in subsequent array designs. © 2015 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Co-evolution of viruses and their hosts has reached a fragile and dynamic equilibrium that allows viral persistence, replication and transmission. In response, infected hosts have developed strategies of defense that counteract the deleterious effects of viral infections. In particular, single-strand DNA editing by Apolipoprotein B Editing Catalytic subunits proteins 3 (APOBEC3s) is a well-conserved mechanism of mammalian innate immunity that mutates and inactivates viral genomes. In this review, we describe the mechanisms of APOBEC3 editing during viral replication, the viral strategies that prevent APOBEC3 activity and the consequences of APOBEC3 modulation on viral fitness and host genome integrity. Understanding the mechanisms involved reveals new prospects for therapeutic intervention. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Torque teno felis virus (FcTTV) was detected in the cat population in the Czech Republic. A total of 110 serum samples were tested by a nested PCR technique using specific primers, situated in the highly conserved untranslated region of the virus genome. The frequency of feline TT virus in the Czech Republic was found to be 33.63%. Sequencing of PCR product from several virus strains showed that all of them are closely related and belong to the same virus species. Whole genome sequencing of three strains was performed to compare overall genetic heterogeneity of feline TT viruses. One of these three strains showed more that 10% difference at the nucleotide level. Furthermore we didn't find any correlation between FcTTV infection and sex or health status of examined animals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study used next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies to characterize the gut virome at the onset of islet autoimmunity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a case-control study nested within the Finnish Diabetes Prediction and Prevention (DIPP) cohort. The stool virome in 19 case children, who turned islet autoantibody positive before the age of 2 years and later developed clinical type 1 diabetes, and 19 tightly matched control subjects was analyzed using NGS performed from stool samples collected 3, 6, and 9 months before the onset of islet autoimmunity. Human virus findings were verified using real-time PCR. RESULTS: One or more human viruses were present in 10.4% and bacteriophages were in 54% of the samples. The virome composition showed no association with islet autoimmunity. NGS was less sensitive and specific than real-time PCR. CONCLUSIONS: The present data suggest no dramatic changes in the gut virome shortly before the emergence of islet autoimmunity and emphasize the need of verification of mass sequencing results when viral exposure is assessed in association studies. © 2015 by the American Diabetes Association.

AB  - Objective: To establish an assay for the detection of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) strains and to analyze its preliminary application to biologics. Methods: Primers and probe were designed according to the conserved sequences. A fluorescent PCR assay for the detection of TTSuV strains was established. Several parameters including the specificity, linearity, accuracy, sensitivity and anti-interference of the established assay were verified. The fluorescent PCR assay was performed to detect the samples of porcine blood, cell substrate and rotavirus vaccine. The porcine blood samples positive for TTSuV strains were further genotyped. Results: The established fluorescent PCR assay was confirmed to have high specificity as no cross-reactions with parvovirus virus of various species, SV40 and porcine circovirus strains were detected. The linear range of the assay was 1×109-1×103 copies/μl for TTSuV1 genotype and 1×109-1×102 copies/ μl for TTSuV2 genotype with a R2 value more than 0.993. The sensitivity of the fluorescent PCR assay was 1×103 copies/μl for TTSuV1 genotype and 1×102 copies/μl for TTSuV2 genotype. The intra-and inter-CVs were both less than 7% in Ct values and less than 25% and 45% respectively in copies. No interference was found in the detection of TTSuV nucleic acids from cell samples.8 out of 20 porcine blood samples were positive for TTSuV strains, among which one sample was positive for TTSuV1 genotype, four samples were positive for TTSuV2 genotype and the rest were positive for both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genotypes.Compared with the reference strain, strains genotyped as TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were respectively shared 98%-99% and 98% homologies in sequences. All of the cell substrate and rotavirus vaccine samples detected by the fluorescent PCR assay were negative for TTSuV strains. Conclusion: The fluorescent PCR assay for the detection of TTSuV was established successfully, the application of which would further improve the safety of biologics.

AB  - Background: The human Torque Teno virus (TTV) causes persistent viremia in most immunocompetent individuals. Elevated TTV levels are observed after solid organ transplantation and are related to the extent of immunosuppression especially during the phase of maintenance immunosuppression. However, the extent to which the TTV increase in the early phase post-transplantation is associated with the patient' s immunosuppressive state is unclear. Objectives: In this study, we assessed the TTV increase dynamics in detail during the first three months after lung transplantation under a defined immunosuppressive regimen and in relation to the pre-transplant TTV level. Study Design: Forty-six lung transplant recipients (LTRs) were included in this prospective longitudinal study. All received alemtuzumab induction combined with tacrolimus and corticosteroids immunosuppressive therapy. Plasma TTV DNA was monitored before transplantation and regularly within the first three months post-transplantation (n = 320 samples; mean sampling interval: 12.2 days). Results: In 43/46 LTRs (93%), TTV DNA was detectable before transplantation (median 4.4 log<inf>10</inf>copies/mL; range: 2.0-6.4). All 46 LTRs showed a TTV increase post-transplantation, which followed a sigmoidal-shaped curve before the median peak level of 9.4 log<inf>10</inf> copies/mL (range: 7.6- 10.7) was reached at a median of day 67 (range: 41-92). The individual TTV DNA doubling times (range: 1.4-20.1 days) significantly correlated with the pre-transplant TTV levels calculated over 30 or 60 days post-transplantation (r = 0.61, 0.54, respectively; both P < 0.001), but did not correlate with the mean tacrolimus blood levels. Pre-transplant TTV levels were not associated with time and level of the patients' post-transplant TTV peak load. Conclusion: The TTV level may be used to mirror the state of immunosuppression only after the patients' initial peak TTV level is reached. © 2015 Görzer et al.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We studied the serological response between the special regions on the Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) ORF1 coded protein and the porcine sera from conventional pigs.
METHODS: Based on a Chinese TTSuV2 strain from Guangdong province, two overlapped virus proteins were expressed from Escherichia coli. Then, purified recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins were used as the antigens in the Western Blotting and ELISA assay.
RESULTS: The recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins were identified with the special tag monoclonal antibody. The results of the ELISA tests shown that there were significant relationships between two groups of dates from the recombinant TTSuV2 ORF1a and TTSuV2 ORF1ab proteins antigenic assay. The results of the following Western Blotting assay indicated that the TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies were contained in pig sera.
CONCLUSION: The truncated TTSuV2 ORF1a protein (positions 168 to 346 corresponding to TTSuV2 GDIMA1) contains important B cell epitopes which can stimulate immune system antibody secretion. The truncated TTSuV2 ORF1a protein could be effective in TTSuV2 immunodiagnosis.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of the Torque teno virus in healthy donors in the northern and northwestern regions of the state of Paraná, southern Brazil. Methods: The Torque teno virus was detected by a nested polymerase chain reaction using a set of oligoprimers for the N22 region. Results: The prevalence of the virus was 69% in 551 healthy blood donors in southern Brazil. There was no statistically significant difference between the presence of the virus and the variables gender, ethnicity and marital status. There was significant difference in the prevalence of the virus regarding the age of the donors (p-value. = 0.024) with a higher incidence (74.7%) in 18- to 24-year-old donors. Conclusion: A high prevalence of Torque teno virus was observed in the population studied. Further studies are needed to elucidate the routes of contamination and the clinical implications of the virus in the healthy population. © 2015 Associação Brasileira de Hematologia, Hemoterapia e Terapia Celular.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is increasingly considered a universal marker of global immune function. The virus is supposed to replicate in lymphocytes, but poor information is available about fluctuations of viraemia after administration of anti-lymphocyte agents. We studied TTV kinetics in a cohort of 70 kidney±pancreas recipients receiving one of two different anti-T-cell induction immunosuppressants. During the first 30 days after anti-T-cell antibody administration, we report kinetics of TTV viraemia compatible with replication in T lymphocytes, and highly dependent on the potency of the anti-T-cell drug administered. ©  2015 The Authors.

AB  - Objective: To define the molecular epidemiology of respiratory viral infections in adult patients. Methods: Nasal and throat swabs were collected from all adult patients with influenza-like illness (ILI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), or severe ARI (SARI) admitted to a tertiary hospital in Surakarta, Indonesia, between March 2010 and April 2011 and analyzed for 19 respiratory viruses and for torque teno virus (TTV) and human gyrovirus (HGyV). Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in 61.3% of the subjects, most of whom had ARI (90.8%, OR = 11.39), were hospitalized (96.9%, OR = 22.31), had asthma exacerbation (90.9%, OR = 8.67), and/or had pneumonia (80%, OR = 4.0). Human rhinovirus (HRV) A43 predominated. Influenza A H3N2, human metapneumovirus (HMPV) subtypes A1 and A2, the influenza B virus, human adenovirus B, and human coronavirus OC43 were also detected. All respiratory viruses were detected in the transition month between the rainy and dry seasons. No mixed respiratory virus infection was found. Coinfections of the influenza A H3N2 virus with TTV, HMPV with TTV, HRV with TTV, and human parainfluenza virus-3 with TTV were found in 4.7, 2.8, 19.8, and 0.9% of the samples, respectively. Conclusions: This study highlights the need to perform routine detection of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalized with ARI, asthma exacerbation, and/or pneumonia. © 2015 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Associations between Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) and the occurrence of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) have been reported with controversial results. Currently, no studies have been performed comparing simultaneously viral loads of TTSuVs and PCV2. To examine the role for TTSuVs in PMWS-affected animals, a SYBR Green-based quantitative PCR (qPCR) was designed to detect and quantify TTSuV1, TTSuV2 and PCV2 genomes in swine sera. TTSuV1 genome loads were significantly higher in healthy adults than in young and SPF animals (p < 0.05) suggesting that the prevalence of TTSuV1 infection increases with age and bears no association with PMWS. Regarding TTSuV2, no significant variation was detected in viral loads within any of the groups. As expected, PCV2 genome loads were higher in PMWS-affected swine than in healthy or SPF animals (p < 0.001). These findings provide clear evidence to indicate that neither TTSuV1 nor TTSuV2 viral loads have any correlation with the occurrence of PMWS. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Data regarding the influence of the APOBEC3B deletion on infectious diseases remain limited and shown discrepancies. Objectives: To characterize the APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism status and its association with prevalence of co-infection with blood-borne pathogens in Indonesian HIV-infected individuals. Materials and methods: A total of 597 HIV-positive blood samples were tested for the hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), Torque Teno virus (TTV), GB virus-C (GBV-C), and Toxoplasma gondii. Nucleic acid was extracted from plasma samples and used for the molecular detection of HIV RNA, HBV DNA, HCV RNA, TTV DNA, and GBV-C RNA, whereas HBsAg, anti-HCV, IgM and IgG anti-. T. gondii were detected through serological testing. The APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism was genotyped by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: The deletion genotype was associated with HCV viremia (. p<. 0.001) as well as elevated IgG anti-T. gondii (adjusted OR [aOR]. =. 3.4). The deletion genotype was also associated with decreased levels of HBsAg (aOR. =. 0.03), and anti-HCV (aOR. =. 0.1). D/D was frequently found in HIV-infected individuals with CD4. +. T cells. <. 14% (aOR. =. 5.8). The intact genotype was associated with a reduced likelihood of a CD4. +. T cell count. <. 200 cells/μL (aOR. =. 0.2) but a higher prevalence of TTV co-infection (aOR. =. 8.6). Conclusions: The APOBEC3B deletion polymorphism was found to be associated with HBV, HCV, TTV, and T. gondii co-infection in Indonesian HIV-infected individuals. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) has been associated with non A-G hepatitis. The goal of this study was to estimate the infection rates and genotypic characteristics of TTV in the State of Qatar. A total of 644 blood samples representing different nationalities: (i) Qatari (118) and (ii) non-Qatari (526) nationals (mostly from Arab and South Eeast Asia countries) were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by nested PCR. The majority (573) of the blood samples belonged to healthy blood donors, whereas 54 and 53 of the blood samples belonged to patients infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), respectively. The results obtained showed that the TTV infection rates in the healthy blood donors, and those infected with HBV or HCV patients were 81.4, 90.75 and 84.9%, respectively. Significant association between TTV viremia and age, or nationality was observed. Sequence analysis of PCR fragments amplified from the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of all (531) TTV positive samples showed that 65.5% (348/531) of the PCR fragment sequences were classified into main genogroup 3, followed by main genogroups 5 (24%), 2 (5.8%), and 1 (4.7%). Genogroup 4 was not detected among the our studied subjects. Phylogenetic and pairwise analyses using sequences from TTV viremic samples also showed an overall close similarity to the main genogroup 3. In conclusion, there was no significant difference in the rates of TTV detection among Qataris and non-Qataris and several genotypes, mainly genotype 3, were isolated. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Teno Torque virus, member of the family of Anelloviridae, has been associated with many autoimmune diseases such as idiopathic hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and multiple sclerosis. Its viral load tends to be higher in the bone marrow and in tissues with high turnover rate. We report here a case of an 11-month-old infant affected by acute myeloid leukemia who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, and after 6 months had autoimmune hepatitis and atopic dermatitis. Extremely high-cytokine IP-10 and eotaxin levels were found in her sera, and serological tests and RT-PCR for viruses showed positive results exclusively for Teno Torque virus. © 2014 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Objective Acute respiratory worsening is defined as the unexpected rapid deterioration of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and idiopathic acute respiratory worsening is known as an acute exacerbation of IPF. Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular single-stranded DNA virus whose pathological significance remains unclear. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and titer of TTV DNA in IPF patients with acute respiratory worsening. Methods The serum TTV DNA titer was measured using real-time PCR in nine IPF patients (two treated with steroids and immunosuppressants; seven treated without steroids or immunosuppressants) who developed acute worsening, including five patients with acute exacerbation. The serum TTV DNA titer was also measured in eight stable IPF cases and four IPF cases of lung cancer. In addition, in order to examine time course changes in the TTV DNA titer, the titer was measured more than once, with an interval of four weeks or longer, in eight patients. Results Among the nine IPF patients with acute worsening, the TTV DNA titer was above 1×106 copies/ mL in two subjects without acute exacerbation who had been continuously treated with steroids and immunosuppressants. Meanwhile, the mean TTV DNA titer was 2.4±2.6 (×104 copies/mL) in the five patients with acute exacerbation and 3.1±3.4 (×104 copies/mL) in the eight patients with stable IPF. Moreover, the TTV DNA titers were increased in all three IPF patients who started treatment with steroids and immunosuppressants. Conclusion Our results suggest that it is unlikely that TTV is directly involved in the onset of acute exacerbation of IPF and that the serum TTV DNA titer potentially reflects the immunosuppressive state of the host due to treatment. © 2015 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

AB  - Anelloviruses are a group of single-stranded circular DNA viruses infecting several vertebrate species. Four species have been found to infect swine, namely Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) 1a and 1b (TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b; genus Iotatorquevirus), TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b (genus Kappatorquevirus). TTSuV infection in pigs is distributed worldwide, and is characterized by a persistent viremia. However, the real impact, if any, on the pig health is still under debate. In the present study, the impact of pig immunization on TTSuVk2a loads was evaluated. For this, three-week old conventional pigs were primed with DNA vaccines encoding the ORF2 gene and the ORF1-A, ORF1-B, and ORF1-C splicing variants and boosted with purified ORF1-A and ORF2 Escherichia coli proteins, while another group served as unvaccinated control animals, and the viral load dynamics during natural infection was observed. Immunization led to delayed onset of TTSuVk2a infection and at the end of the study when the animals were 15 weeks of age, a number of animals in the immunized group had cleared the TTSuVk2a viremia, which was not the case in the control group. This study demonstrated for the first time that TTSuV viremia can be controlled by a combined DNA and protein immunization, especially apparent two weeks after the first DNA immunization before seroconversion was observed. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms behind this and its impact for pig producers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Bacterial indicator organisms are used globally to assess the microbiological safety of waters. However, waterborne viral outbreaks have occurred in drinking water systems despite negative bacterial results. Using viral markers may therefore provide more accurate health risk assessment data. In this study, fecal, wastewater, stormwater, surface water (fresh and salt), groundwater, and drinking water samples were analyzed for the presence or concentration of traditional indicators, innovative indicators and viral markers. Samples were obtained in the United States, Italy, and Australia and results compared to those reported for studies conducted in Asia and South America as well. Indicators included total coliforms, Escherichia coli, enterococci, Male-specific coliphages, somatic coliphages and microviradae. Viral markers included adenovirus, polyomavirus, and a potential new surrogate, Torque teno virus (TTV). TTV was more frequently found in wastewaters (38-100%) and waters influenced by waste discharges (25%) than in surface waters used as drinking water sources (5%). TTV was also specific to human rather than animal feces. While TTV numbers were strongly correlated to other viral markers in wastewaters, suggesting its utility as a fecal contamination marker, data limitations and TTV presence in treated drinking waters demonstrates that additional research is needed on this potential viral indicator. © IWA Publishing 2015.

AB  - Patients who undergo dialysis treatment or a renal transplant have a high risk of blood-borne viral infections, including the Torque teno virus (TTV). This study identified the presence of TTV and its genome groups in blood samples from 118 patients in dialysis and 50 renal-transplant recipients. The research was conducted in a hospital in the city of Maringá, state of Paraná. The viral DNA, obtained from whole blood, was identified by using two nested Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCR). The frequencies of TTV were 17% and 36% in dialysis patients using the methodology proposed by Nishizawa et al. (1997) and Devalle and Niel (2004), respectively, and 10% and 54% among renal-transplant patients. There was no statistically significant association between the frequency of the pathogen and the variables: gender, time in dialysis, time since transplant, blood transfusions, and the concomitant presence of hepatitis B, for either the dialysis patients or the renal-transplant recipients. Among dialysis patients and renal-transplant recipients, genogroup 5 was predominant (48% and 66% respectively), followed by genogroup 4 (37% and 48%) and genogroup 1 (23% and 25%). Genogroup 2 was present in both groups of patients. Some patients had several genogroups, but 46% of the dialysis patients and 51% of the renal-transplant recipients had only a single genogroup. This study showed a high prevalence of TTV in dialysis patients and renal-transplant recipients. © 2015, Sociedade Brasileira de Microbiologia.

AB  - Purpose To test the hypothesis that uncultured organisms may be present in cases of culture-negative endophthalmitis by use of deep DNA sequencing of vitreous biopsies. Design Single-center, consecutive, prospective, observational study. Participants Aqueous or vitreous biopsies from 21 consecutive patients presenting with presumed infectious endophthalmitis and 7 vitreous samples from patients undergoing surgery for noninfectious retinal disorders. Methods Traditional bacterial and fungal culture, 16S quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), and a representational deep-sequencing method (biome representational in silico karyotyping [BRiSK]) were applied in parallel to samples to identify DNA sequences corresponding to potential pathogens. Main Outcome Measures Presence of potential pathogen DNA in ocular samples. Results Zero of 7 control eyes undergoing routine vitreous surgery yielded positive results for bacteria or virus by culture or 16S polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A total of 14 of the 21 samples (66.7%) from eyes harboring suspected infectious endophthalmitis were culture-positive, the most common being Staphylococcal and Streptococcal species. There was good agreement among culture, 16S bacterial PCR, and BRiSK methodologies for culture-positive cases (Fleiss' kappa of 0.621). 16S PCR did not yield a recognizable pathogen sequence in any culture-negative sample, whereas BRiSK suggested the presence of Streptococcus in 1 culture-negative sample. With the use of BRiSK, 57.1% of culture-positive and 100% of culture-negative samples demonstrated the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) sequences, compared with none in the controls (P = 0.0005, Fisher exact test). The presence of TTV viral DNA was confirmed in 7 cases by qPCR. No other known viruses or potential pathogens were identified in these samples. Conclusions Culture, 16S qPCR, and BRiSK provide complementary information in presumed infectious endophthalmitis. The majority of culture-negative endophthalmitis samples did not contain significant levels of bacterial DNA. "Culture negativity" does not seem to be due to failure of growth of fastidious bacteria. The small DNA virus TTV was unexpectedly found in all culture-negative samples and some culture-positive samples. This study cannot distinguish whether TTV is a direct intraocular pathogen, an adjuvant for inflammation, a general marker of inflammation, or a commensal virus but provides a testable hypothesis for a pathogenic mechanism in culture-negative endophthalmitis. © 2015 American Academy of Ophthalmology.

AB  - Although the infection of different animals and non-human primates with other members of Anelloviridae have already been reported there is no report about infection of animals with Torque teno midi virus/Small anellovirs (TTMDV/SAV). The aim of this study was to detect the virus in domestic village chickens. Blood samples were collected from 79 domestic village chickens in Isfahan. Blood samples of five adult laying hens and one cockerel were collected in three consecutive weeks (days 1, 8 and 14) as experimental chickens. Ten eggs were randomly collected from the eggs laid during days 12 to 17 and thin and thick egg whites and yolk samples were collected aseptically. After DNA extraction Nested-PCR was performed using SMAs/SMAr primers. In PCR, 431 bp and 441 bp products were detected. The detected bands were extracted and sequenced. Totally 26 out of 79 (32.9%) of the blood samples were positive for the virus. The frequency of the infection of the different parts of the eggs tested was 76%. For the first time TTMDV/SAV was detected in domestic village chickens which also vertically transmitted to eggs.

AB  - Recently, studies have suggested an association between the Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) and the Porcine circovirus-2 (PCV2) in PCV2-associated disease cases. The aim of this study was to verify TTSuVs loads in pig faeces from PCV2-positive animals with and without diarrhea from PCVAD-affected and PCV2-unvaccinated herds. A total of 80 faecal samples were collected individually from nursery and grow-finish pigs with (n = 40) or without (n = 40) diarrhea. The samples were tested for PCV2 and TTSuVs by using DNA binding dye SYBR Green quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Torque teno sus virus k2 (TTSuVk2) load in the faeces was significantly higher in the nursery pigs with diarrhea, and these pigs also exhibited significantly higher PCV2 (P < 0.01) faecal matter loads compared to the non-diarrheic animals from the same age group. Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) viral loads were the same regardless of age group and disease condition. There were no correlations between PCV2 and TTSuV1 or TTSuVk2 and TTSuV1 viral loads; however, a weak correlation (r = 0.23, P = 0.03) was found between TTSuVk2 and PCV2 viral loads. In conclusion, TTSuVk2 viral loads were significantly higher in the diarrheic faeces from the nursery pigs. Additionally, the higher loads of PCV2 and TTSuVk2 in the nursery-diarrheic animals revealed that diarrhea might have an important role in the spread of both viruses in herds. © 2015, University of Veterinary and Pharmaceutical Sciences.

AB  - Although several studies suggest a virus or (endogenous) retrovirus involvement at the time of onset of schizophrenia, the unequivocal identification of one or more infectious agents, by means of an undirected catch-all technique, has never been conducted. In this study VIDISCA, a virus discovery method, was used in combination with Roche-454 high-throughput sequencing as a tool to determine the possible presence of viruses (known or unknown) in blood of first-onset drugs-naïve schizophrenic patients with prominent negative symptoms. Two viruses (the Anellovirus Torque Teno virus and GB virus C) were detected. Both viruses are commonly found in healthy individuals and no clear link with disease was ever established. Viruses from the family Anelloviridae were also identified in the control population (4.8%). Besides, one patient sample was positive for human endogenous retroviruses type K (HML-2) RNA but no specific predominant strain was detected, instead 119 different variants were found. In conclusion, these findings indicate no evidence for viral or endogenous retroviral involvement in sera at the time of onset of schizophrenia. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background: The pathogenic association of Transfusion Transmitted Virus or Torque teno Virus (TT Virus) single and mixed infections with leukemia was under evaluation in these years but confront with controversies. This hypothesis is based on the higher prevalence of TT Virus infection in patients with leukemia compared with controls. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of TT Virus, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Hepatitis B Virus (HBV), and Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infections in patients with leukemia and healthy controls. Patients and Methods: In this cross sectional study, 95 patients with leukemia and 100 healthy controls who were admitted to the Namazi Hospital affiliated to the Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, were enrolled between years 2012 and 2013. Blood samples treated with EDTA were collected from each patient with leukemia and controls. The existence of TT Virus infection was analyzed using the semi-nested PCR method. The immunological prevalence of HBV and HCV infections were evaluated using HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab ELISA based protocols, respectively. Active CMV infection was also evaluated using an immunofluorescence method. Also risk factors of leukemia and viral infections were statistically analyzed in patients with leukemia. Results: The TT Virus infection was significantly found in 40 of 95 (42.1%) and 12 of 100 (12%) patients with leukemia and controls, respectively. The HBs-Ag and HCV-Ab were detected in 27 of 95 (28.4%) and 18 of 69 (26.1%) patients with leukemia but were not found in the controls. Active CMV infection was also found in 11 of 69 (16%) patients and none of the controls. Significant co-infection of TT Virus was found with HBV (15 of 40; 37.5%), HCV (14 of 40; 35%) and CMV (7 of 40; 17.5%) in patients with leukemia. Conclusions: Confirmation of the significantly higher frequency of TT Virus, HBV, HCV and CMV single infection and their co-infection in patients with leukemia compared with healthy controls, emphasizes the determinative role of TT Virus pathogenesis in clinical outcomes observed in patients with leukemia, which requires extensive evaluation by further studies. © 2015, Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Human torque teno viruses (TTVs) are new, emerging infectious agents, recently assigned to the family Anelloviridae. The first representative of the genus, torque teno virus (TTV), was discovered in 1997, followed by torque teno mini virus (TTMV) in 2000, and torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) in 2007. These viruses are characterized by an extremely high prevalence, with relatively uniform distribution worldwide and a high level of genomic heterogeneity, as well as an apparent pan-tropism at the host level. Although these viruses have a very high prevalence in the general population across the globe, neither their interaction with their hosts nor their direct involvement in the etiology of specific diseases are fully understood. Since their discovery, human anelloviruses, and especially TTV, have been suggested to be associated with various diseases, such as hepatitis, respiratory diseases, cancer, hematological and autoimmune disorders, with few arguments for their direct involvement. Recent studies have started to reveal interactions between TTVs and the host’s immune system, leading to new hypotheses for potential pathological mechanisms of these viruses. In this review article, we discuss the most important aspects and current status of human TTVs in order to guide future studies. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Few studies have examined the lung virome in health and disease. Outcomes of lung transplantation are known to be influenced by several recognized respiratory viruses, but global understanding of the virome of the transplanted lung is incomplete. To define the DNA virome within the respiratory tract following lung transplantation we carried out metagenomic analysis of allograft bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), and compared with healthy and HIV+ subjects. Viral concentrates were purified from BAL and analyzed by shotgun DNA sequencing. All of the BAL samples contained reads mapping to anelloviruses, with high proportions in lung transplant samples. Anellovirus populations in transplant recipients were complex, with multiple concurrent variants. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction quantification revealed that anellovirus sequences were 56-fold more abundant in BAL from lung transplant recipients compared with healthy controls or HIV+ subjects (p<0.0001). Anellovirus sequences were also more abundant in upper respiratory tract specimens from lung transplant recipients than controls (p=0.006). Comparison to metagenomic data on bacterial populations showed that high anellovirus loads correlated with dysbiotic bacterial communities in allograft BAL (p=0.008). Thus the respiratory tracts of lung transplant recipients contain high levels and complex populations of anelloviruses, warranting studies of anellovirus lung infection and transplant outcome. The authors analyze viral sequences in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from lung transplant recipients using shotgun metagenomics and quantitative PCR, revealing high levels and complex populations of anelloviruses within the lung allografts. © Copyright 2014 The American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons.

AB  - Background In Japanese Red Cross (JRC) blood centers, blood collected from donors with serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels of more than 60 U/L are disqualified even if serologically negative for transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs). To assess potential risks of TTIs in plasma with elevated serum ALT levels in the current donor screening program of the JRC, we conducted a metagenomic analysis (MGA) of virome profiles in the plasma of blood donors with or without elevated serum ALT levels. Study Design and Methods Based on serum ALT levels, donors were classified into three groups: "high," more than 79 U/L; "middle," 61 to 79 U/L; and "low," less than 61 U/L. We individually analyzed 100 plasma samples from each group by MGA, employing shotgun sequencing. Viral sequences detected using MGA were partly confirmed using real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results Donors with high and middle ALT levels were significantly younger than those with low ALT levels, and more than 90% were males. Herpesviridae, Anelloviridae, Picornaviridae, and Flaviviridae sequences were identified in plasma samples, and their distribution and frequency were not significantly different among the three groups. Conclusion The serum ALT test may be unsuitable for monitoring for additional risks of TTIs in blood donors who were negative for typical TTIs using serologic and nucleic acid tests. Although MGA is less sensitive than PCR, it remains the best technology to detect known viruses in these donors. © 2015 AABB.

AB  - Background: Torquetenovirus (TTV) represents a commensal human virus producing life-long viremia in approximately 80% of healthy individuals of all ages. A potential pathogenic role for TTV has been suggested in immunocompromised patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology sustained by strong proinflammatory cytokines. Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the sera immunological profile linked to TTV infection in bone marrow transplant (BMT) children with liver injury. Study design: TTV infection was assessed in sera from 27 BMT patients with altered hepatic parameters and histological features, by the use of quantitative real-time PCR, along with TTV genogroups and coinfection with HEV. The qualitative and quantitative nature of soluble inflammatory factors was evaluated studying a large set of cytokines using the Bioplex platform. As controls, sera from 22 healthy children negative for serological and molecular hepatitis markers including TTV and HEV, and for autoimmune diseases, were selected. Results and conclusions: TTV was detected in 81.4% of BMT patients with a viral load ranging from 105 to 109 copies/mL. All samples were HEV-RNA negative. A pattern of cytokines, IFN-γ, TNF-α, FGF-basic (p&lt;0.01) and MCP-3 (p&lt;0.001) was found significantly highly expressed in TTV-positive patients compared to TTV-negative and controls. Of note, MCP-3 chemokine showed the highest sera concentration independently of the amount of TTV load and the status of immune system deregulation (p&lt;0.001). In this pilot study for the first time, a positive association was found between TTV and increased level of MCP-3 suggesting a indirect role of TTV in liver injury. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: Livestock animals have been the assumed source of several human epidemics in recent years, for example, influenza H1N1, rotavirus G8/G9, and MERS-CoV. Surveillance of novel viruses in animals is essential to evaluate the risk to human and animal health and to determine any economic impact, for example, failure to thrive. There is a paucity of data regarding detection and characterisation of gastroenteritis viruses, particularly novel viruses, in porcines in Ireland. Recently, a number of small novel porcine DNAviruses have emerged globally, for example, torque teno sus virus, porcine bocavirus, and parvoviruses 2 & 4, and little is known about the biology and potential pathogenicity of these viruses. Bocaparvovirus is a genetically distinct group of viruses which has been recently detected in humans and animals. Methods: In this study, the presence of gastroenteritis viruses (rotavirus A, porcine circovirus, adenovirus, and porcine bocavirus) was investigated in a selection of archived faecal samples from asymptomatic piglets from a commercial farm in Ireland. A total of 104 specimens were pooled and screened using conventional molecular techniques (PCR and RT-PCR), a subset of specimens (n=44) were then examined individually. Viral diversity was then investigated using statistical and phylogenetic techniques. Results: Initial screening showed a high prevalence of PBoV in this farm, with the formation of three distinct groups in phylogenetic analysis. Other viruses were also investigated in this study with the first report of PCV, PAdV and lineage I G5 RVA in Ireland. Some specimens contained >1 virus, with statistical analysis indicating a strong correlation for mixed infections of PBoV and PAdV on this farm. Conclusion: Investigating the diversity of circulating enteric viruses on Irish porcine farms is important to improve the prophylactic tools available and to facilitate the early detection of changes in circulating viruses. © 2015 Lynda Gunn et al.

AB  - Background & objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and syphilis infections pose a great threat to blood safety. This study was undertaken to investigate the seroprevalence of serologic markers for transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) among blood donors at a hospital based blood centre in north India over a period of nine years. Methods: the results of serologic markers for TTIs (HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HIV and syphilis) of all blood donations (both voluntary and replacement) at our hospital from January 2005 to December 2013 were screened. Additional analysis was conducted to examine the prevalence trends associated with each of the positive marker. Results: The data of 180,477 donors [173,019 (95.86%) males and 7,458 (4.13%) females] were analyzed. Replacement donations [174,939 (96.93%)] represented the majority whereas, only 5,538 (3.06%) donations were from the voluntary donors. The risk of blood being reactive was three times higher in male donors when compared with the female donors. The risk of blood being reactive for one or more infectious markers was 2.1 times higher in replacement donors when compared with the voluntary donors. Seropositivity of HIV, HBsAg, HBcAb, syphilis showed a significant decreasing trend (p<0.05) while there was an increasing trend in HCV infection which was insignificant. Interpretation & conclusions: This study reflects that the risk of TTIs has been decreased over time with respect to HIV, HBV and syphilis, but the trends for HCV remains almost the same in blood donors. Blood transfusion remains a risk factor for the spread of blood-borne infections. Therefore, improvements are needed to strengthen both safety and availability of blood. © 2015, Indian Council of Medical Research. All rights reserved.

AB  - Necessity of local data for carrying out screening among children with increase in a thyroid gland. It was determined the volume of a thyroid gland by ultrasonography among school children of the Aktobe area, Kazakhstan. During the period from May to December, 2013 it was conducted the transversal research on the school children, living in oil-and-gas and pollution-free regions of Aktobe area, Kazakhstan. In total 815 schools of 7-11 year-old-children, answered of criteria of the research, were included in the research. The anthropometry was measured before ultrasonography, and then the doctor of the functional diagnostics took measurement of thyroid volume by means of the portable ultrasonic device, according to the protocols recommended of WHO (World Health Organization). Ioduria was checked at 10% of the school children chosen in a random way. Prevalence of a goitre in our sampling with use of the 97% of volume, recommended of WHO / ICCIDD (2007) made 24,7±1,50%. Distribution of a goitre in areas is made: 44,6 42,8% in the oil-and-gas area (20,4% at girls and 24,18% at boys) and 8,3% (5,6% at girls and 2,7% at boys) in the pollution-free area. The mean values of the total thyroid volume (TTV), measured by means of ultrasonography, are made in oil-and-gas areas 4,43±1,66 ml, in - 2,9±1,24 ml ( p < 0.0001 p < 0.0001). The difference in TTV between boys of the compared areas was statistically significant ( p < 0.0001): 4,62±1,75 ml against 2,78±0,93 ml; between girls of oil-and-gas and safe areas - 4,23±1,53 ml against 3,05±1,52 ml accordingly ( p < 0.0001). The size of a thyroid gland of school children in Aktobe area of the Western Kazakhstan is higher, than reference values, about which was reported from WHO. These data can be used for definition of the local reference during of carrying out of screening among children with increase in the thyroid gland. High prevalence of the goitre in oil-and-gas areas against the background an adequate iodine provision according to a ioduria testify that in the region possibility of formation of an endemia at the expense of the raised content of xenobiotics in a surrounding medium is not excluded, in this case products of petroleum refining and gas, and is required further studying.

AB  - Porcine bocavirus is a recently discovered virus that infects pigs and is classified within the Bocavirus genus (family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae). The viral genome constitutes linear single-stranded DNA and has three open reading frames that encode four proteins: NS1, NP1, VP1, and VP2. There have been more than seven genotypes discovered to date. These genotypes have been classified into three groups based on VP1 sequence. Porcine bocavirus is much more prevalent in piglets that are co-infected with other pathogens than in healthy piglets. The virus can be detected using PCR, loop-mediated isothermal amplification, cell cultures, indirect immunofluorescence, and other molecular virology techniques. Porcine bocavirus has been detected in various samples, including stool, serum, lymph nodes, and tonsils. Because this virus was discovered only five years ago, there are still many unanswered questions that require further research. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge and primary research achievements regarding porcine bocavirus. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - We describe here the metagenomics-derived viral sequences detected in beef, pork, and chicken purchased from stores in San Francisco. In beef we detected four previously reported viruses (two parvoviruses belonging to different genera, an anellovirus, and one circovirus-like virus) and one novel bovine polyomavirus species (BPyV2-SF) whose closest relatives infect primates. Detection of porcine hokovirus in beef indicated that this parvovirus can infect both ungulate species. In pork we detected four known parvoviruses from three genera, an anellovirus, and pig circovirus 2. Chicken meat contained numerous gyrovirus sequences including those of chicken anemia virus and of a novel gyrovirus species (GyV7-SF). Our results provide an initial characterization of some of the viruses commonly found in US store-bought meats which included a diverse group of parvoviruses and viral families with small circular DNA genomes. Whether any of these viruses can infect humans will require testing human sera for specific antibodies. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been identified as transfusion-transmitted virus in humans, initially. Although TTV viremia is extremely common in the general population worldwide, there is no direct causal evidence linking TTV infection to specific clinical manifestations. Our hypothesis was that TTV might play a role in Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by inducing inflammatory mechanisms previously identified. The study was conducted on 57 COPD patients and 39 healthy control groups. COPD patient groups included: the patients (n:20) with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation, the patients (n:19) who received only medical treatment, and the invited patients (n:18) for outpatient control. Serum samples were collected from patients and voluntary blood donors. TTV DNA quantification was carried out with a real time PCR by the hybridization probe system and viral load was interpreted through the crossing point value. TTV DNA was detected in the majority of both patients and healthy control groups. The prevalence was 94.4% (17/18) in patients for outpatient control, 94.7% (18/19) in patients who received only medical treatment, 100% (20/20) in patients with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation and 84.6% (33/39) in healthy controls. This difference was not statistically significant. However, CP values was statistically different in all the patient groups from the control group. TTV DNA prevalence was higher in patients than healthy individuals. More interesting thing, viral load was highest in the patients with exacerbation needed noninvasive ventilation. As a result, TTV may be associated with COPD and the severity of it. © 2014, E-Century Publishing Corporation. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is an etiological agent of porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs). Post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) as the most important PCVD is considered a multifactorial disease. It was demonstrated that not only PCV2 but several viruses are associated with PMWS. Studies of viral co-infections in PMWS pigs led often to controversial results. The aim of this work was to determine the presence of emerging (PRRSV), re-emerging (PTV) and newly-emerging (TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PBoV1) viruses in samples of dead pigs suffering from PMWS. The impact of vaccination against PCV2 and the influence of age on the occurrence of single and multiple viral infections in pigs were also investigated.Results: Viruses were detected by PCR, RT-PCR and real-time PCR in the pooled tissue samples (lymph nodes, liver and spleen) of pigs with PMWS (n = 56) which were divided into three groups: suckling piglets, post-weaning pigs and fattening pigs. In addition, lymph node samples were collected from apparently healthy fattening pigs (n = 59). The effect of vaccination against PCV2 with Ingelvac CircoFlex vaccine was also investigated. Between non-vaccinated pigs, the highest prevalence of individual viruses and multiple viral infections were found in diseased post-weaning and fattening animals with PMWS. Severe clinical disease was observed in swine co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV. The prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was high in all groups of pigs and did not appear to have a significant effect on the syndrome. Simultaneous infection with TTSuV1 and PBoV1 was frequently confirmed in pigs with PMWS. No healthy pig was found to be infected with PRRSV, PTV or PBoV1. Vaccination against PCV2 did not influence the prevalence of TTSuVs, but significantly protected pigs against multiple viral infections.Conclusions: Post-weaning PMWS pigs were more often co-infected with viral pathogens than suckling or fattening pigs. Co-infection with PRRSV enforces clinical signs of PMWS, the influence of other viral co-infections is not clear. Vaccination against PCV2 significantly reduced viral co-infections in pigs. © 2014 Vlasakova et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), Torque teno virus (TTV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Surakarta, Indonesia, and the risk factors and sexual behavior associated with these infections. A cross sectional study was performed from October 2009 to October 2011 among 143 MSM by face-to-face interviews to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects were tested for ,HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2 and toxoplasma infection using serology and for TTV using molecular detection. The seropositive rates for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, anti-HTLV-1/2, IgM anti-T. gondii, IgG anti-T, gondii and TTV DNA were 9.1%, 9.8%, 28.0%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 30.8%, and 26.6%, respectively. Risk factors associated with HIV infection were a history of injecting drug use (IDU) [adjusted OR (aOR) 6.0; 95% CI: 1.10-33.01] and a receptive role in sexual activity (aOR 8.1; 95% CI: 1.30-50.04). Using saliva as a sex lubricant (aOR 0.1; 95% CI: 1.84-12.30) was the only factor associated with HCV infection. Having a tattoo (aOR 3.2; 95% CI: 1.28-7.98) and practicing both anal and vaginal sex without a condom (aOR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.06-4.92) were associated with toxoplasma infection. A history of IDU (aOR 32; 95% CI: 5.93-177.93) was associated with TTV infection. The subjects examined in this study were found to be infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2, TTV, and T. gondii. These infections were associated with high-risk behavior.

AB  - Porcine torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) has been suggested as a co-factor for the development of porcine circovirus-associated diseases. However, the pathogenic role of TTSuV is still inconclusive, and the target cell and tissue tropism of this virus are also ambiguous. In the present study, a multi-strained pooled probe-based in situ hybridization was established to detect the nucleic acids of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in the tissue. The strategy of using polymerase chain reaction-derived digoxigenin-labeled multi-strained pooled probe, instead of single-strained probe or oligonucleotide, was to overcome the fact of high sequence diversity among TTSuV strains and simultaneous infection with distinct strains of TTSuV in the same animal. The cell tropism and tissue distribution were evaluated by grading system with tissues from major organs. Lymphoid tissues, including superficial inguinal, mesenteric, and hilar lymph nodes, tonsil, intestinal lamina propria of mucosa and Peyer's patches, and sometimes spleen, generally contained higher levels of positive signals and are considered as the target sites for TTSuV. Morphologically, the distribution of TTSuV-positive signals had a strong correlation with the T lymphocyte zone. T lymphocytes are, thus, speculated as the major target cells for TTSuV. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To investigate the detection rate and distribution of torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) positive/negative pigs, 2384 pathological tissues samples collected from 6 provinces of Eastern China from 2010 to 2013 were amplified using previously published PRRSV and TTSuV1 primers. The presence and viral load of TTSuV1 were investigated in a wide range of samples from 5 PRRSV positive/negative 4-week-old pigs by real-time TaqMan PCR. TTSuV1 was detected in 65.3% of 1115 PRRSV-positive samples, and 47.2% of 1269 negative samples. Viral DNA was most commonly detected in the immune organs, including spleen, lung, pancreas, and mesenteric and inguinal lymph nodes, followed by serum, liver, kidney, trachea, anal swabs, nasal swabs and sex glands of PRRSV-positive or negative pigs. TTSuV1 DNA loads in PRRSV-positive pigs increased from 2 to 5 times in almost all the corresponding parts compared with PRRSV-negative pigs. Statistical analysis showed that PRRSV may have a synergistic effect with TTSuV1, and promote the replication and proliferation of TTSuV1. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death worldwide. An expanding body of evidence supports the role of human microbiome in the establishment of CVDs and, this has gained much attention recently. This work was aimed to study the circulating human microbiome in CVD patients and healthy subjects. The levels of circulating cell free DNA (circDNA) was higher in CVD patients (n = 80) than in healthy controls (n = 40). More specifically, the relative levels of circulating bacterial DNA and the ratio of 16S rRNA/β-globin gene copy numbers were higher in the circulation of CVD patients than healthy individuals. In addition, we found a higher circulating microbial diversity in CVD patients (n = 3) in comparison to healthy individuals (n = 3) by deep shotgun sequencing. At the phylum level, we observed a dominance of Actinobacteria in CVD patients, followed by Proteobacteria, in contrast to that in healthy controls, where Proteobacteria was predominantly enriched, followed by Actinobacteria. The circulating virome in CVD patients was enriched with bacteriophages with a preponderance of Propionibacterium phages, followed by Pseudomonas phages and Rhizobium phages in contrast to that in healthy individuals, where a relatively greater abundance of eukaryotic viruses dominated by Lymphocystis virus (LCV) and Torque Teno viruses (TTV) was observed. Thus, the release of bacterial and viral DNA elements in the circulation could play a major role leading to elevated circDNA levels in CVD patients. The increased circDNA levels could be either the cause or consequence of CVD incidence, which needs to be explored further. © 2014 Dinakaran et al.

AB  - A current controversy is whether patients with sepsis progress to an immunosuppressed state. We hypothesized that reactivation of latent viruses occurred with prolonged sepsis thereby providing evidence of clinically-relevant immunosuppression and potentially providing a means to serially-monitor patients' immune status. Secondly, if viral loads are markedly elevated, they may contribute to morbidity and mortality. This study determined if reactivation of herpesviruses, polyomaviruses, and the anellovirus TTV occurred in sepsis and correlated with severity. Serial whole blood and plasma samples from 560 critically-ill septic, 161 critically-ill non-septic, and 164 healthy age-matched patients were analyzed by quantitative-polymerase-chain-reaction for cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr (EBV), herpes-simplex (HSV), human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6), and TTV. Polyomaviruses BK and JC were quantitated in urine. Detectable virus was analyzed with respect to secondary fungal and opportunistic bacterial infections, ICU duration, severity of illness, and survival. Patients with protracted sepsis had markedly increased frequency of detectable virus. Cumulative viral DNA detection rates in blood were: CMV (24.2%), EBV (53.2%), HSV (14.1%), HHV-6 (10.4%), and TTV (77.5%). 42.7% of septic patients had presence of two or more viruses. The 50% detection rate for herpesviruses was 5-8 days after sepsis onset. A small subgroup of septic patients had markedly elevated viral loads (&gt;104-106 DNA copies/ml blood) for CMV, EBV, and HSV. Excluding TTV, DNAemia was uncommon in critically-ill non-septic patients and in age-matched healthy controls. Compared to septic patients without DNAemia, septic patients with viremia had increased fungal and opportunistic bacterial infections. Patients with detectable CMV in plasma had higher 90-day mortality compared to CMV-negative patients; p&lt;0.05. Reactivation of latent viruses is common with prolonged sepsis, with frequencies similar to those occurring in transplant patients on immunosuppressive therapy and consistent with development of an immunosuppressive state. Whether reactivated latent viruses contribute to morbidity and mortality in sepsis remains unknown. © 2014 Walton et al.

AB  - Background: Torque Teno Virus (TTV) is a DNA virus with high rate of prevalence globally. Since its discovery in 1997, several studies have questioned the role of this virus in causing disease. However, it still remains an enigma. Although methods are available for detection of TTV infection, there is still a need for simple, rapid and reliable method for screening of this virus in human population. Present investigation describes the cloning and expression of N22 region of TTV-genome and the use of expressed peptide in development of immunoassay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in serum. Since TTV genotype-1 is more common in India, the serum positive for genotype-1 was used as source of N22 for expression purpose. Methods. Full length N22 region of ORF1 from TTV genotype-1 was amplified and cloned in pGEM®-T Easy vector. After cloning, the amplicon was transformed and expressed as a fusion protein containing hexa-histidine tag in pET-28a(+) vector using BL21 E. coli cells as host. Expression was conducted both in LB medium as well as ZYP-5052 auto-induction medium. The expressed peptide was purified using metal-chelate affinity chromatography and used as antigen in developing a blot immunoassay. Results: Analysis of translated product by SDS-PAGE and western blotting demonstrated the presence of 25 kDa polypeptide produced after expression. Solubility studies showed the polypeptide to be associated with insoluble fraction. The use of this peptide as antigen in blot assay produced prominent spot on membrane treated with sera from TTV-infected patients. Analysis of sera from 75 patients with liver and renal diseases demonstrated a successful implication of N22 polypeptide based immunoassay in screening sera for anti-TTV antibodies. Comparison of the immunoassay developed using expressed N22 peptide with established PCR method for TTV-DNA detection showed good coherence between TTV-DNA and presence of anti-TTV antibodies in the sera analysed. Conclusions: This concludes that TTV N22 region may be expressed and safely used as antigen for blot assay to detect anti-TTV antibodies in sera. © 2014 Mankotia and Irshad; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are widespread in humans, swine as well as in several other animal species. In market ready swine, the reported prevalence ranges between 11% and 100%. Through a national retail sampling plan from the Canadian Integrated Program for Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance (CIPARS) program, 283 and 599 liver and pork chop samples, respectively, were collected over a 12-month period from commercial establishments in 5 selected geographical regions of Canada to assess the presence of Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) in these products.TTSuVs were detected in 97.9% of pork chops with viral loads ranging between 1×104 and 9.9×105 genomic copies (gc)/g and 98.6% of liver samples with viral loads ranging from 1×105 to 9.9×106 gc/g.A selection of 20 positive samples (10 pork chop and 10 liver) from the 5 geographical regions were further tested for the production, of a 305. bp fragment for TTSuV1 and a 253. bp fragment for TTSuV2 in the non-coding region. TTSuV1 was present in all 10 liver and 10 pork chops samples while TTSuV2 was detected in 10 liver and 9 pork chop samples. Two different TTSuV1 sequences were simultaneously detected from 5 of 20 samples and 2 different TTSuV2 sequences were detected from 6 of 19 samples. The omnipresence of TTSuVs in commercial pork samples may allow its use as a viral indicator to monitor the effectiveness of cleaning and disinfecting process in slaughtering, cutting, slicing and packaging facilities. © 2014.

AB  - Pericarditis is a common human disease defined by inflammation of the pericardium. Currently, 40% to 85% of pericarditis cases have no identified etiology. Most of these cases are thought to be caused by an infection of undetected, unsuspected or unknown viruses. In this work, we used a culture- and sequence-independent approach to investigate the viral DNA communities present in human pericardial fluids. Seven viral metagenomes were generated from the pericardial fluid of patients affected by pericarditis of unknown etiology and one metagenome was generated from the pericardial fluid of a sudden infant death case. As a positive control we generated one metagenome from the pericardial fluid of a patient affected by pericarditis caused by herpesvirus type 3. Furthermore, we used as negative controls a total of 6 pericardial fluids from 6 different individuals affected by pericarditis of non-infectious origin: 5 of them were sequenced as a unique pool and the remaining one was sequenced separately. The results showed a significant presence of torque teno viruses especially in one patient, while herpesviruses and papillomaviruses were present in the positive control. Co-infections by different genotypes of the same viral type (torque teno viruses) or different viruses (herpesviruses and papillomaviruses) were observed. Sequences related to bacteriophages infecting Staphylococcus, Enterobacteria, Streptococcus, Burkholderia and Pseudomonas were also detected in three patients. This study detected torque teno viruses and papillomaviruses, for the first time, in human pericardial fluids. © 2014 Fancello et al.

AB  - The underlying trigger for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has remained elusive, and multiple interacting environmental and genetic factors likely contribute to the onset and perpetuation of the disease. Among environmental influences, infectious agents have been suggested to play a pivotal role in driving autoimmunity pathogenesis via structural or functional molecular mimicry, the expression of proteins that induce cross-reactive responses against self-antigens, and the aberrant activation or apoptosis of different immune system cells in the context of a peculiar genetic background. The increased viral load and changing subsets of lytic or latent viral proteins observed in selected populations with SLE have indicated that common viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus, retroviruses and transfusion-transmitted viruses, might be triggers for this disease. Alternatively, some infectious agents might exert a protective effect from autoimmunity. Existing achievements have not been fully investigated and clarified. Thus, the aim of this review is to analyze the medical literature within the last 15. years regarding the role of infectious agents in the pathogenesis of SLE. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background. Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous infectious agent. Transplant recipients are at risk of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection and could be vulnerable to TTV-associated adverse effects. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of immunosuppression and HEV infection on TTV replication and liver injury in pediatric patients after orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT).Methods. Pediatric recipients of liver transplants were classified into the following 2 groups: (1) those with normal serum aminotransferases levels and (2) those with persistently increased serum aminotransferases levels and histological features of chronic hepatitis of unknown etiology. The TTV load was assessed in 342 serum samples by use of TaqMan real-time polymerase chain reaction, along with TTV genogroups and coinfection with HEV.Results. TTV DNA was detected in 96% of tested serum samples. Viral load was significantly lower in patients with features of chronic hepatitis, of whom 78% had liver fibrosis scores of ≥2. Viral load decreased during posttransplantation follow-up. Viral load and genogroups were influenced by immunosuppression. Lower viral load was observed in patients coinfected with HEV.Conclusions. TTV infection is widespread, and its replication is closely related to immune status and viral coinfection. High TTV viremia is not associated with hepatitis after OLT, but, conversely, liver inflammatory activity impairs TTV replication. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a large group of vertebrate-infecting small viruses with circular single-stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. In swine, two genetically distinct species, Torque teno sus virus 1a (TTSuV1a) and 1b (TTSuV1b) are currently grouped into the genus Iotatorquevirus. More recently, a novel Torque teno sus virus species, named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), has been included with Torque teno sus virus k2a (TTSuVk2a) into the genus Kappatorquevirus. In the present study, TTSuV1 (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b prevalence was evaluated in 721 serum samples of healthy pigs from Sardinian farms, insular Italy. This is the largest study to date on the presence of TTSuV in healthy pigs in Italy. The global prevalence of infection was 83.2% (600/721), being 62.3% (449/721), 60.6% (437/ 721), and 11.5% (83/721) the prevalence of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b, respectively. The rate of co-infection with two and/or three species was also calculated, and data show that co-infections were significantly more frequent than infections with single species, and that TTSuV1+TTSuVk2a double infection was the prevalent combination (35.4%). Quantitative results obtained using species-specific real time-qPCR evidenced the highest mean levels of viremia in the TTSuV1 subgroup, and the lowest in the TTSuVk2b subgroup. Interestingly, multiple infections with distinct TTSuV species seemed to significantly affect the DNA load and specifically, data highlighted that double infection with TTSuVk2a increased the viral titers of TTSuV1, likewise the co-infection with TTSuVk2b increased the titers of TTSuVk2a. © 2014 Blois et al.

AB  - Background: Recently, some new viruses have been identified for their association with hepatitis which Torque Teno Mini Virus being among them. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of Torque Teno Mini Virus in healthy individuals and hepatitis B and C patients in Isfahan, Iran. Materials and Methods: One hundred serum samples of healthy individuals from Isfahan Blood Transfusion Organization were collected. A total of 25 human serum samples from hepatitis B and 25 samples from hepatitis C infected patients were also collected from Mahdieh diagnostic laboratory in Isfahan, Iran. Viral DNA was extracted and Torque Teno Mini Virus DNA was detected using a nested PCR with primer sets designed for a conserved region of the Torque Teno Mini Virus genome. PCR and Reverse transcriptase PCR were used for detection of HBV and HCV respectively. Results: Torque Teno Mini Virus -DNA was detected in 17% of healthy individuals. It also was detected in 20% and 48% of serum samples from hepatitis B and C infected individuals, respectively. The frequency of Torque Teno Mini Virus was significantly higher in hepatitis C patients versus healthy individuals (P < 0.05). Also, the frequency of TTMV in hepatitis C patients was significantly higher than hepatitis B patients (P < 0.05). Conclusions: The difference in Torque Teno Mini Virus frequency between the hepatitis C and healthy group was significant (P< 0.05). The etiology of the higher infection rate in hepatitis C individuals needs to be determined.

AB  - A fluorescent microbead-based immunoassay (FMIA) for simultaneous detection of IgG antibodies against Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1), TTSuV2, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus type 1 (PRRSV-1) and PRRSV-2 was developed. Serum samples were obtained over time from 20 pigs. Twelve of 20 were exposed to TTSuV2 on day 0, 20/20 were vaccinated with a PRRSV-2 vaccine on day 35, and 20/20 were exposed to PRRSV-2 on day 63. Anti-TTSuV antibodies were detected in 30% of the pigs on day 0, and 90% by day 35. All PRRSV-2 vaccinated pigs had detectable anti-PRRSV-2 IgG 21 days after vaccination. Field samples from 17 farms were also tested. The seroprevalence of both PRRSV and TTSuV increased with age. Comparison of the PRRSV-2 FMIA to an ELISA revealed good correlation in young pigs but a high rate of false positives in older pigs. Cross-reaction between PRRSV types was a problem. © 2014.

AB  - Up to now, there has been no report of co-infection of torque teno virus (TTV) with other enteric viruses playing a role in the pathogenesis of viral acute gastroenteritis (AGE). We investigated the proportion, epidemiological and clinical features of concurrent infections of adenovirus (ADV), norovirus (NV) and TTV in stools of 155 patients with AGE attending Wei-Gong Memorial Hospital, Miaoli City, Taiwan. The presence of the three viruses were determined using PCR-based assays. Some 55% of the patients were infected with at least 1 enteric virus, among whom 18% were co-infected, NV and TTV being the most common (62%). Rate of co-infectious in AGE patients is correlated statistically significantly (p < 0.05) with age, fever and drinking of spring water. Furthermore, AGE children with co-infection have a higher hospitalization rate (69%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of ADV, NV and TTV triple co-infection in children (2) with AGE. This study also revealed that TTV co-infection promoted the pathogenicity of other infectious agents. © SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) has been found to be prevalent world-wide in healthy populations and in patients with various diseases, but its etiological role has not yet been determined. Using high-throughput unbiased sequencing to screen for viruses in the serum of a patient with persistent high fever who died of suspected viral infection and prolonged weakness, we identified the complete genome sequence of a TTV (isolate Hebei-1). The genome of TTV-Hebei-1 is 3649 bp in length, encoding four putative open reading frames, and it has a G+C content of 49%. Genomic comparison and a BLASTN search revealed that the assembled genome of TTV-Hebei-1 represented a novel isolate, with a genome sequence that was highly heterologous to the sequences of other reported TTV strains. A phylogenetic tree constructed using the complete genome sequence showed that TTV-Hebei-1 and an uncharacterized Taiwanese strain, TW53A37, constitute a new TTV genotype. The patient was strongly suspected of carrying a viral infection and died eventually without any other possible causes being apparent. No virus other than the novel TTV was identified in his serum sample. Although a direct causal link between the novel TTV genotype infection and the patient's disease could not be confirmed, the findings suggest that surveillance of this novel TTV genotype is necessary and that its role in disease deserves to be explored. © 2014 Wuhan Institute of Virology, CAS and Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Introduction: Torque teno virus (TTV) and SEN virus are circular single-stranded DNA viruses that cause blood-borne infections. The SEN virus (SEN-V) was originally detected in the serum of an injection drug user infected with human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV). Recently TTV was discovered as a potential causative agent of non-A-E hepatitis. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of the SEN-V-D/H and TTV in HIV patients and healthy blood donors in Iran. Methods: One hundred and fi fty HIV patients with a mean age of 50.46 ± 18.46 years and 150 healthy blood donors with a mean age of 48.16 ± 13.73 years were included in this study. TTV and SEN-V were detected by the PCR and were quantitatively assayed by competitive PCR (nested and semi-nested PCR). Restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) were used to determine the heterogeneity of TTV. Results: TTV and SEN-V were detected 96 (64%) and 84 (56%) of 150 HIV patients respectively. These rates were 34% (n=51) and 37.33% (n=56) in healthy blood donors (signifi cant, p<0.05). PCR detected SEN-V/TTV DNA from 32 of the healthy blood donors (21.33%), while 65 (43.33%) of HIV patients were positive for SEN-V/TTV DNA. Of 150 HIV patients, 32.66% and 23.33% were positive for SEN-V-H and SEN-V-D, respectively and 18.66% (n=28) were co-infected with SEN-V-D/H. Conclusions: The prevalence of SEN-VD/H and TTV is higher in HIV patients than in healthy blood donors in Southern Iran. Our results suggest that TTV and SEN-V might play a role in the development of liver disease in patients with immunodefi ciency diseases.

AB  - Until now, data on the epidemiological (including ages and seasonality) features of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in acute gastroenteritis (AGE) in Taiwan are limited. The aim of this study investigated TTV Infections in children and adults with gastroenteritis in Taiwan. One hundred fifty five AGE stool samples were collected from August 2011 to July 2012 and detected TTV using polymerase chain reaction method. TTV was isolated in 80 (51.6%) of 155 stool specimens. TTV was isolated from all age groups. Statistical analysis showed that the TTV infectious rate of AGE patients was statistically significant (P < 0.05) in summer, fall and winter season respectively. Data from this study showing the existence of TTV in fecal samples indicated that the high rates of prevalence of TTV among AGE patients might be due to a possible fecal-oral route of transmission of TTV.

AB  - Indicator organisms are used to assess pathogen risk in waters, however, indicators often do not correlate with pathogens. Direct pathogen monitoring (e.g., human adenoviruses) may provide data on actual risk from one pathogen but may not be indicative of overall risk. A potential alternative indicator is Torque teno virus (TTV), which may co-locate with pathogenic enteric viruses but has not been associated with any disease. The objective of this research was to determine the value of TTV as a potential indicator of human fecal contamination and viral pathogen risk in the United States. Occurrence of TTV in animal feces, wastewaters, and drinking waters was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction with primers in the highly conserved untranscribed region to detect TTV human genotypes. These data were compared to data on standard indicators and human adenovirus presence. TTV was detected in 4.0% of animal feces, 41.7% of wastewater samples, and 13.9% of drinking water samples. These relatively low positive rates in waters may reflect the relatively low prevalence of serum TTV positivity in the United States. Adenoviruses were detected in a larger percentage (83.3%) of wastewaters (indicative of human fecal contamination) than TTV, and analysis of nonhuman animal feces showed the human adenovirus assay to have a higher degree of specificity. This study adds to the understanding of the global occurrence of TTV. Based on a lack of correlation with fecal indicators and varying prevalence rates in humans, TTV does not appear to be a suitable indicator of fecal contamination. © 2014 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.

AB  - Background Nosocomial outbreaks of viral etiology are costly and can have a major impact on patient care. Many viruses are known to persist in the inanimate environment and may pose a risk to patients and health care workers. We investigate the frequency of environmental contamination with common health care-associated viruses and explore the use of torque-teno virus as a marker of environmental contamination. Methods Environmental screening for a variety of clinically relevant viruses was carried out over 3 months in a UK pediatric hospital using air sampling and surface swabbing. Swabs were tested for the presence of virus nucleic acid by quantitative polymerase chain reactions. Results Viral nucleic acid was found on surfaces and in the air throughout the screening period, with adenovirus DNA being the most frequent. Door handles were frequently contaminated. Torque-teno virus was also found at numerous sites. Conclusion Evidence of environmental contamination with viral pathogens is present in health care environments and may be indicative of an infectious virus being present. Screening for viruses should be included in infection control strategies. Torque-teno virus may provide a better marker of contamination and reduce time and cost of screening for individual viruses. © 2014 by The Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America.

AB  - TT virus is a newly described agent infecting humans. Initially isolated from a patient (initials T. T.) with unexplained hepatitis, the virus has since been found in both healthy and diseased individuals. The objective of our study was to apply effective TTV PCR detection system in order to analyse and prove its presence in blood samples among patients with: hepatitis, brain tumour, respiratory diseases, unknown pathology cases, renal transplantation and volunteer blood donors in Bulgaria. The most sensitive of the PCR assays was utilised to demonstrate the prevalence of TT viruses to be at least 61.87% in volunteer blood donors, 62.74% in patients with respiratory diseases, 65.21% in hepatitis cases, 62.96% in unknown pathology cases, 66.66% in patients with brain tumour and 64.28% in patients with renal transplantation. This is the first report demonstrating the TT viruses in Bulgaria.

AB  - Background The airborne spreading of enteric viruses can occur through the aerosol and droplets produced by toilet flushing. These can contaminate the surrounding environment, but few data exist to estimate the risk of exposure and infection. For this reason environmental monitoring of air and selected surfaces was carried out in 2 toilets of an office building and in 3 toilets of a hospital before and after cleaning operations. Methods To reveal the presence of norovirus, enterovirus, rhinovirus, human rotavirus, and Torque teno virus and to quantify human adenovirus and bacteria counts, molecular and cultural methods were used. Results On the whole, viruses were detected on 78% of surfaces and in 81% of aerosol. Among the researched viruses, only human adenovirus and Torque teno virus were found in both surface and air samples. In several cases the same adenovirus strain was concurrently found in all matrices. Bacterial counts were unrelated to viral presence and cleaning did not seem to substantially reduce contamination. Conclusions The data collected in our study confirm that toilets are an important source of viral contamination, mainly in health care settings, where disinfection can have a crucial role in preventing virus spread. © 2014 Published by Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Understanding immunosenescence and changes in antimicrobial immune response with age is of high importance. The association of immunosenescence with gender and persistent infection with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a matter of intensive research. We determined whether replication of another persistent and highly prevalent virus, Torque teno virus (TTV), is related to age, gender, and HCMV IgG serostatus of the host. TTV DNA load in plasma was assessed by real-time PCR in 313 healthy persons: 20–30 years old (young, n = 104), 50–60 years old (middle-aged, n = 101), or >80 years old (elderly, n = 108). TTV DNA loads were further associated with age-groups, gender, and HCMV IgG serostatus. TTV load was significantly higher in the elderly compared to the young group (p < 0.001; Tukey’s honest significant difference (HSD)), and the higher TTV DNA levels over age were found to be gender-specific (p = 0.002; ANOVA), with young women showing the lowest TTV load compared to young men (p = 0.009, t test) and compared to the other female age-groups (middle-aged p = 0.005; elderly p < 0.001; Tukey’s HSD). TTV load of HCMV IgG-seropositive persons was significantly higher than that of the HCMV IgG seronegative in the young (p = 0.005; t test) and middle-aged (p = 0.016; t test) groups. These results indicate that the host’s immune control of TTV replication decreases with age and is gender-specific. Persistent HCMV infection is significantly related to higher TTV DNA loads, especially at a younger age. Therefore, the influence of gender and HCMV on immunosenescence earlier in life should be further explored. © 2014, American Aging Association.

AB  - To investigate the diversity of viral flora, we used metagenomics to study the viral communities in a pooled faecal sample of 27 diarrhoeic piglets from intensive commercial farms in China. The 15 distinct mammalian viruses identified in the pooled diarrhoeic sample were, in order of abundance of nucleic acid sequence, Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), sapovirus, porcine bocavirus- 4 (PBoV-4), sapelovirus, torovirus, coronavirus, PBoV-2, stool-associated single-stranded DNA virus (poSCV), astrovirus (AstV), kobuvirus, posavirus-1, porcine enterovirus-9 (PEV-9), porcine circovirus-like (po-circo-like) virus, picobirnavirus (PBV) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV-2). The prevalence rate of each virus was verified from diarrhoeic and healthy piglets by PCR assay. A mean of 5.5 different viruses were shed in diarrhoeic piglets, and one piglet was in fact coinfected with 11 different viruses. By contrast, healthy piglets shed a mean of 3.2 different viruses. Compared with samples from healthy piglets, the co-infection of PEDV and PBoV had a high prevalence rate in diarrhoea samples, suggesting a correlation with the appearance of diarrhoea in piglets. Furthermore, we report here for the first time the presence of several recently described viruses in China, and the identification of novel genotypes. Therefore, our investigation results provide an unbiased survey of viral communities and prevalence in faecal samples of piglets.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) presence was investigated in peripheral blood of 117 brazilian women by nested polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was observed in 18.6% of healthy donors and in 24.32% Human Papillomavirus (HPV) patients. TTV presence was also investigated in the HPV positive group for comparison between the cervical cancer and noncancerous patients. TTV DNA prevalence was significantly higher among the HPV positive patients with cervical cancer (57.14%) than in HPV noncancerous patients (16.67%). Thus, the presence of TTV infection could be a risk factor for cancer development in the patients presenting HPV-TTV coinfection. Further studies are required to clarify the TTV influence in HPV pathogenesis.

AB  - Anelloviruses are a family of small circular ssDNA viruses with a vast genetic diversity. Human infections with the prototype anellovirus, torque teno virus (TTV), are ubiquitous and related viruses have been described in a number of other mammalian hosts. Despite over 15 years of investigation, there is still little known about the pathogenesis and possible disease associations of anellovirus infections, arising in part due to the lack of a robust cell culture system for viral replication or tractable small-animal model. We report the identification of diverse anelloviruses in several species of wild rodents. The viruses are highly prevalent in wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) and field voles (Microtus agrestis), detectable at a low frequency in bank voles (Myodes glareolus), but absent from house mice (Mus musculus). The viruses identified have a genomic organization consistent with other anelloviruses, but form two clear phylogenetic groups that are as distinct from each other as from defined genera.

AB  - There is disagreement on the optimal timing of HAART initiation based on absolute CD4+ T-cell count (CD4+ count). We investigated if naïve patients with CD4+ T-cell percentage (%CD4+) <29% or CD4+/CD8+ ratio <1 display signs of immune deterioration notwithstanding CD4+ count ≥500 cells/μl. We found that these patients show B-cell aberrations and an impaired control of Torque Teno Virus replication. By contrast, patients with CD4+≥500/μl, %CD4+≥29% and CD4+/CD8+≥1 displayed features of healthy subjects. Results obtained suggest that a combination of these parameters could be an adequate surrogate marker of immunological competence. This will be helpful in deciding when to start HAART.

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute to the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Viral infections have been reported to be associated with the disease. A number of exogenous viruses have been linked to the pathogenesis of SLE, of which Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has the most evidence of an aetiological candidate. In addition, human endogenous retroviruses (HERV), HRES-1, ERV-3, HERV-E 4-1, HERV-K10 and HERV-K18 have also been implicated in SLE. HERVs are incorporated into human DNA, and thus can be inherited. HERVs may trigger an autoimmune reaction through molecular mimicry, since homology of amino acid sequences between HERV proteins and SLE autoantigens has been demonstrated. These viruses can also be influenced by oestrogen, DNA hypomethylation, and ultraviolet light (UVB) exposure which have been shown to enhance HERV activation or expression. Viral infection, or other environmental factors, could induce defective apoptosis, resulting in loss of immune tolerance. Further studies in SLE and other autoimmune diseases are needed to elucidate the contribution of both exogenous and endogenous viruses in the development of autoimmunity. If key peptide sequences could be identified as molecular mimics between viruses and autoantigens, then this might offer the possibility of the development of blocking peptides or antibodies as therapeutic agents in SLE and other autoimmune conditions. © The Author(s) 2014 Reprints and permissions: sagepub.co.uk/journalsPermissions.nav.

AB  - The objectives of this study were to investigate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis D virus (HDV), human T-lymphotropic virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV-1/2), Torque teno virus (TTV) and Toxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) infection among men who have sex with men (MSM) in Surakarta, Indonesia, and the risk factors and sexual behavior associated with these infections. A cross sectional study was performed from October 2009 to October 2011 among 143 MSM by face-to-face interviews to complete an interviewer-administered questionnaire. Subjects were tested for HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2 and toxoplasma infection using serology and for TTV using molecular detection. The seropositive rates for anti-HIV, HBsAg, anti-HCV, anti-HDV, anti-HTLV-1/2, IgM anti-T. gondii, IgG anti-T. gondii and TTV DNA were 9.1%, 9.8%, 28.0%, 0.7%, 0.7%, 1.4%, 30.8%, and 26.6%, respectively. Risk factors associated with HIV infection were a history of injecting drug use (IDU) [adjusted OR (aOR) 6.0; 95% CI: 1.10-33.01] and have been pierced (aOR 8.1; 95% CI: 1.30-50.04). Having a tattoo (aOR 3.2; 95% CI: 1.28-7.98) and practicing sex without a condom (aOR 2.3; 95% CI: 1.06-4.92) were associated with toxoplasma infection. A history of IDU (aOR 32; 95% CI: 5.93-177.93) was associated with TTV infection. The subjects examined in this study were found to be infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HTLV-1/2, TTV, and T. gondii. These infections were associated with high-risk behavior. © SEAMEO TROPMED Network. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Infectious agents are considered to be crucial environmental factor in the etiopathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Infections may serve as initial trigger to the development of autoimmunity and carry an overall greater risk of morbidity and mortality than the general population. Initial presentation of SLE can mimic infections, and in turn infections can mimic disease flares in established SLE. Infections due to predisposition by commonly used immunosuppressive therapies are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In this review, viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections that contribute to the etiology of SLE, potentially mimic or precipitate flares, create diagnostic dilemmas, complicate treatment, or protect against disease, are discussed. Infection risks of current immunosuppressive therapies used in the treatment of SLE are outlined. Strategies to prevent infection, including vaccines, prophylactic antibiotic therapies, toll-like receptor antagonism, and antioxidant treatment that may decrease disease burden and improve quality of life in lupus patients will be discussed.

AB  - Background: Blood transfusion service (BTS) is an integral part of health care system which primarily aims at providing adequate and safe blood. Transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) pose constant threat to safety of recipients of blood. Therefore all donated blood should be screened against these infections. Aims &objectives: This retrospective study was carried out to know seroprevalence of different Transfusion transmitted infections in healthy blood donors of Western U.P.to prevent transmission of diseases. Material and method: Blood units collected from healthy non remunerated, replacement and voluntary donors within blood bank premises of Sharda hospital, Greater Noida, over a period of 6 years(2007-2012) were screened against NACO recommended TTI- HIV, HBsAg, HCV, Syphilis and Malaria parasite. Results: Total donations were 9592. Out of which 330 donors were sero reactive and 18 showed co infections (dual infection). Seropositivity for HBsAg was present in 168 donors (1.75%), HCV - 116(1.208%), RPR for syphilis 52 (0.54%) and HIV - 12 cases (0.12%). Majority of single and co infections were in 21-40 yrs age group.Co infection was present in 18 cases. RPR done for syphilis was a common positive marker in all 18 cases of co infection. Other infections were HBsAg -11 cases (61.1%), HCV - 6 cases (33.3%) and HIV - one case (5.55%). Conclusion: Blood bank should follow more stringent donor selection criteria and promote voluntary donation. Public awareness regarding mode of spread of TTI and judicious use of blood will reduce the threat of transfusion transmitted infections. © 2014, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

AB  - Blood transfusion centers are under considerable pressure to produce platelet concentrates with high quality and safety due to the short shelf life of 3-5 days as well as possible bacterial and viral contaminations. For a variety of reasons, many Europeans have changed their methods of component production from whole blood using the North American standard platelet-rich plasma method to the buffy coat method of platelet production. Many advantages and some limitations during conversion from platelet-rich plasma method to buffy coat method have been observed. It seems that decisions to switch from platelet-rich plasma method to buffy coat method with whole blood component production should be considered; the benefits from increased platelet yield, improved platelet quality, increased plasma recovery, reduced blood transfusion adverse reactions and lower pathogen transmission rates compared to the platelet-rich plasma method outweigh any transient difference in red cell parameters or inconsiderable reduction of factor VIII activity. The purpose of this review is to discuss the quality, safety and economic aspects of blood components production during conversion from platelet-rich plasma to buffy coat method in preparing blood components which may benefit developing countries. © 2014, Iranian Pediatric Hematology and Oncology Society.

AB  - A field trial was initiated to investigate the post-treatment effects of soil allelochemical residue (SAR) of nemafric-BL and nemarioc-AL phytonematicides on soil health, growth of sweet sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) and population densities of Meloidogyne species. SAR conditions were created in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) trials, with treatments comprising untreated control, nemafric-BL 3%, nemafric-BL 6%, nemarioc-AL 3% and nemarioc-AL 6%, which were applied at empirically established intervals for a 56-day crop cycle. Soil preparation was followed by a 30-day fallow to allow for microbial decomposition of root remnants. Sweet sorghum seeds were sown on spots where tomato plants grew and soil samples were collected for determining the soil health status at two-leaf stage. At 80 days after sowing, SAR effects improved soil health and contributed 8% in total treatment variation (TTV) of chlorophyll and sugar contents each in sweet sorghum, with nemarioc-AL 3 and 6% phytonematicides stimulating improvement of the two variables. Nemafric-BL SAR effects had no effect on growth of sweet sorghum. In contrast, SAR effects contributed 76 and 39% in TTV of nematode population densities in root and soil, respectively. SAR effects of nemafric-BL and nemarioc-AL inhibited nematode numbers by 67-97% and 64-80%, respectively. In conclusion, SAR effects on soil health, plant growth and nematode population densities were desirable, suggesting that the two products were each still active in the soil. © 2014 © 2014 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus type 1 (TTSuV1) ORF1 is considered to encode the viral capsid (Cap) protein, which is crucial for the induction of TTSuV1-specific antibodies and protective immunity in the host. Eight monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against the Cap protein were generated and biologically characterized. The immunoreactivity of the Cap protein expressed in transfected 293T cells for these mAbs was determined with an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. The antigen epitopes of the Cap protein were mapped using these mAbs and truncated Cap proteins expressed in Escherichia coli. Fine epitope mapping was then performed with a panel of synthesized polypeptides. All the mAbs reacted with the Cap protein C fragment expressed in E. coli. One antigenic epitope of the Cap protein, which reacted with seven mAbs, had the polypeptide sequence 536HPKYAGQGGGYTT548, whereas another epitope recognized by the 1E9 mAb had the polypeptide sequence 549EIGHQGITAASLR561. It is interesting that the two new epitopes are adjacent, but mutually independent. This study should facilitate further investigation of the antigenic differences and enable the differential diagnosis of the virus. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The expression profiles of nonstructural proteins (NSPs) in Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) have not yet been characterized. Here, we determined the coding sequences of the TTSuV2 NSPs ORF2, ORF2/2, and ORF2/2/3 by overlapping polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subsequent expression in bacterial and mammalian cells. We generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), 2E5 and 6F8, from mice immunized with mixed Escherichia coli expressing His-tagged ORF2 and ORF2/2. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and western blot analysis revealed that, 2E5 mAbs bound to the consensus sequences of ORF2, ORF2/2, and ORF2/2/3, while 6F8 recognized the common sequences of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3. Immunofluorescence assay (IFA) revealed that ORF2 was localized in the cytoplasm, ORF2/2, in the nucleus but not the nucleolus, and ORF2/2/3, in the peri-nuclear region. To identify the expression profiles of TTSuV NSPs, a circular TTSuV2_ZJ (GenBank: KF660540) genomic DNA clone was constructed and transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells. Splicing mRNAs and the expression and localization of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3 were identified by RT-PCR, western blot analysis, and IFA, respectively. However, ORF2 was not detected either at the RNA or protein level. Our study is the first to provide experimental evidence of the existence of ORF2/2 and ORF2/2/3 at the protein level. Moreover, the mAbs have potential applications in future research on TTSuV2 viral protein function and diagnosis of related diseases. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are icosahedral, single-stranded circular DNA viruses infecting several vertebrate species. Currently, these viruses are considered non-pathogenic although they are suggested to be co-factors in several diseases. Recently single-stranded circular DNA viruses have been found in human faeces. Considering the consumption of pork meat products and the ubiquitous nature of swine TTV (Torque tenosus virus, TTSuV), the human population is frequently exposed to these viruses. To determine if TTSuVs could be delivered through food, human faecal samples were analysed for their presence. Indeed, the results of this study show that up to 25% of faecal samples were positive for known TTSuVs by PCR and sequencing. Additionally, all commercially available pork products purchased in Spanish supermarkets contained DNA of TTSuV. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is highly prevalent in the general population worldwide. The relationship that TTV establishes with the central nervous system (CNS) of infected hosts is not clear but it is suspected that TTV infection of the CNS lead to increased local expression of inflammatory mediators that may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis (MS). The prevalence and load of TTV in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 207 MS patients and 93 age- and sex-matched healthy controls by qPCR designed on the untranslated region were analyzed. TTV DNA was not detected in CSF, TTV prevalence in serum was similar in MS patients (76.8%) compared to healthy controls (76.3%). Sub analyses performed in MS patients stratified on the basis of clinical phenotypes indicated that TTV viremia was significantly lower in individuals with relapsing remitting compared to chronic progressive disease. Notably, viremia was increased in primary progressive, compared to secondary progressive MS patients, and in relapsing remitting MS patients during quiescent compared to relapsing phases of disease. Since TTV interacts with toll-like receptor (TLR) stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines, TLR9 expression were examined, showing that it was augmented on monocytes of chronic progressive MS patients, in whom higher TTV viremia was present, but this did not correlate with a distinct pattern of cytokine production. Overall these findings suggest that, although TTV infects the same proportion of MS patients and healthy controls, the levels of replication of the virus differ among patients, being correlated with the clinical phenotype of disease.

AB  - TTsuV1 can cause persistent infection and unidentified clinical signs in pigs. In this study, a survey of TTsuV1 prevalence was conducted in slaughter pigs from Henan, Liaoning, and Shandong provinces in China. A total of 180 swine lymphoid tissues were assayed by PCR with primers targeting the conserved 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR). The results showed that a 17.8 % positive rate, and different genotypes were detected. TTSuV1 presented higher viral load and prevalence in inguinal lymph node than in submandibular lymph node samples. All TTsuV1 isolates have 84-100 % nucleotide sequence homology in the 5′-UTR region and can be grouped into three subgenotypes (TTsuV1a-1, TTsuV1a-2, and TTsuV1b). Notably, the novel genetic subtype TTsuV1b was first reported in slaughter pigs. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Water quality through the presence of pathogenic enteric microorganisms may affect human health. Coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and coliphages are normally used as indicators of water quality. However, the presence of above-mentioned indicators do not always suggest the presence of human enteric viruses. It is important to study human enteric viruses in water. Human enteric viruses can tolerate fluctuating environmental conditions and survive in the environment for long periods of time becoming causal agents of diarrhoeal diseases. Therefore, the potential of human pathogenic viruses as significant indicators of water quality is emerging. Human Adenoviruses and other viruses have been proposed as suitable indices for the effective identification of such organisms of human origin contaminating water systems. This article reports on the recent developments in the management of water quality specifically focusing on human enteric viruses as indicators. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - It is well known that workers involved in the management of solid waste are at risk of exposure to bioaerosol, which is generally studied in relation to bacteria, fungi, and endotoxins. However, to date, there have been no reports on the incidence of work-related infectious diseases. To determine if occupational exposure to viruses occurs upon exposure to waste-related activities, monitoring was carried out in a landfill, a waste recycling plant, an incineration plant, and a waste collection vehicles. Air and surfaces were sampled and analyzed for torque teno virus (TTV), human adenovirus (HAdV), norovirus, rotavirus, and enterovirus using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- based techniques. Positivity was confirmed by sequencing and quantification with real-time PCR; infectivity was also tested for culturable viruses. Samples were analyzed in parallel for mean total bacterial and fungi counts in both the summer and winter. In total, 30% (12/40) of air and 13.5% (5/37) of surface samples collected in plants were positive for HAdV and TTV. Among the eight HAdV-positive samples, six (75%), revealed in landfill and recycling plant air and in incinerator and waste vehicles surfaces, were able to replicate in cell culture and were subsequently confirmed as infective. The frequency of detection of virus-positive samples was similar in both seasons, but with evident differences in the type of virus detected: TTV and HAdV were more frequently detected in the summer and winter, respectively. The area of highest viral contamination was the paper selection landfill. Fungi and bacterial contamination did not correlate with viral presence or concentration. In conclusion, we evidence that working with solid and liquid waste can lead to infectious viruses, included in Group 2 of the European Directive 90/679/CEE pathogens list; thus, further investigation on the sources and routes of contamination is needed in order to assess the occupational risk. © The Author 2013.

AB  - Two species of the DNA virus Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), TTSuV1 and TTSuV2, have become widely distributed in pig-farming countries in recent years. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of synonymous codon usage bias in 41 available TTSuV2 coding sequences (CDS), and compared the codon usage patterns of TTSuV2 and TTSuV1. TTSuV codon usage patterns were found to be phylogenetically conserved. Values for the effective number of codons (ENC) indicated that the overall extent of codon usage bias in both TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 was not significant, the most frequently occurring codons had an A or C at the third codon position. Correspondence analysis (COA) was performed and TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 sequences were located in different quadrants of the first two major axes. A plot of the ENC revealed that compositional constraint was the major factor determining the codon usage bias for TTSuV2. In addition, hierarchical cluster analysis of 41 TTSuV2 isolates based on relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) values suggested that there was no association between geographic distribution and codon bias of TTSuV2 sequences. Finally, the comparison of RSCU for TTSuV2, TTSuV1 and the corresponding host sequence indicated that the codon usage pattern of TTSuV2 was similar to that of TTSuV1. However the similarity was low for each virus and its host. These conclusions provide important insight into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV2, as well as better understangding of the molecular evolution of TTSuV2 genomes. © 2013 Zhang et al.

AB  - Background: Although human torque teno viruses (TTVs) were first discovered in 1997, still many associated aspects are not clarified yet. The viruses reveal a remarkable heterogeneity and it is possible that some genotypes are more pathogenic than others. The identification of all genotypes is essential to confirm previous pathogenicity data, and an unbiased search for novel viruses is needed to identify TTVs that might be related to disease. Method. The virus discovery technique VIDISCA-454 was used to screen serum of 55 HIV-1 positive injecting drug users, from the Amsterdam Cohort Studies, in search for novel blood-blood transmittable viruses which are undetectable via normal diagnostics or panvirus-primer PCRs. Results: A novel torque teno mini virus (TTMV) was identified in two patients and the sequence of the full genomes were determined. The virus is significantly different from the known TTMVs (< 40% amino acid identity in ORF1), yet it contains conserved characteristics that are also present in other TTMVs. The virus is chronically present in both patients, and these patients both suffered from a pneumococcal pneumonia during follow up and had extremely low B-cells counts. Conclusion: We describe a novel TTMV which we tentatively named TTMV-13. Further research is needed to address the epidemiology and pathogenicity of this novel virus. © 2013 Jazaeri Farsani et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a member of the recently created family Anelloviridae. Two distinct species of TTSuVs, 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) have been reported so far in domestic pigs and wild boars. Although TTSuVs have not been clearly linked to any specific disease of pigs, a relation between TTSuV infections and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) has been suggested. To examine further this possibility, the present study was conducted in search for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomes in tissues of PMWS and non-PMWS-affected animals. PMWS diagnosis was established by clinical signs, characteristic macroscopic and histopathologic lesions and the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 DNA. Samples of five different tissues (lungs, kidneys, livers, spleens, and lymph nodes) from PMWS-affected and non-PMWS-affected pigs were examined with two specific PCR assays developed to amplify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genome segments. TTSuV1 DNA was detected in tissues of non-diseased animals to significantly higher levels than in tissues of PMWS-affected pigs (p ≤ 0.001). Regarding TTSuV2, viral genomes were detected in nearly all samples from both PMWS-affected (94.7 %) and non-affected pigs (100 %), with no significant differences in the frequencies of detection of TTSuV2 genomes in both groups. No significant differences were detected on the distribution of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in the different tissues examined (p = 0.970). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The human virome is the viral component of the microbiome. Its composition, and interindividual and temporal variability are not precisely known. Its impact on human health has received less attention than that of the bacterial microbiome, but is likely to be equally important, both in homeostasis and disease. Here we review the recent advances in this field and the questions that arise in the context of our rapidly increasing knowledge regarding the composition and function of the human virome. With the ever-extending use of next-generation sequencing (NGS) on a variety of clinical samples, rapid progress on the composition of the human virome and its impact upon human health are to be expected in the coming years. © 2013.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, and invariably fatal, condition that is believed to arise in genetically susceptible individuals as a consequence of an aberrant wound-healing response following repetitive alveolar injury. The exact triggers, which initiate the fibrotic process, remain unknown. Infectious agents, including both viruses and bacteria, have the capacity to cause alveolarepithelial cell injury and apoptosis. Relatively few studies have examined the role of infection in IPF. Those that have, point to viruses playing a key role as cofactors in the initiation and progression of IPF. There is also some evidence to suggest that viral infection may be responsible for a proportion of acute exacerbations of IPF. The role played by bacteria in the pathogenesis of IPF is less clear cut. Studies from other respiratory diseases suggest that alterations in the lung microbiome are associated with disease and that these changes influence disease behaviour. Emerging molecular microbiological techniques are making the study of microbial communities in the lung easier. It is hoped that by combining such techniques with the careful longitudinal phenotyping of patients with IPF, it will be possible to elucidate the role played by bacteria and viruses in the pathogenesis of the disease. If infection plays a causal role in IPF then it is possible that therapeutic strategies, utilising currently available antiviral or antibiotic drugs, may be effective in modifying the course of this devastating condition. © ERS 2013.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive and ultimately fatal disease, with a highly variable course in individual patients. Episodes of rapid deterioration are not uncommon, often following a period of stability. In cases of uncertain etiology, with typical clinical and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) features, the term 'acute exacerbation of IPF' (AE-IPF) has been coined to describe a combination of diffuse alveolar damage and preexisting usual interstitial pneumonia. In 2007, a consensus definition and diagnostic criteria were proposed. Although the presence of overt infection is currently an exclusion criterion, it appears likely that occult infection, reflux and thoracic surgical procedures are all trigger factors for AE-IPF. The development of new, usually bilateral infiltrates (ground-glass attenuation with variable admixed consolidation) is a defining HRCT feature. The outcome is poor with a short-term mortality in excess of 50% despite therapy. A number of pathophysiologic pathways are activated, with immunologic dysregulation, epithelial damage and circulating fibrocytes all believed to play a pathogenetic role. Acute exacerbations are less prevalent in other fibrotic lung diseases than in IPF and may have a better outcome, with the exception of acute exacerbations of rheumatoid lung. In AE-IPF, the exclusion of alternative causes of rapid deterioration, including heart failure and infection, is the main goal of investigation. Empirical high-dose corticosteroid steroid therapy is generally used in AE-IPF, without proven benefit. © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infection is present in pig herds worldwide. It has been demonstrated that TTSuV might increase the severity of other important viral diseases with economic and public health impacts. At present, there is no information on the age distribution of pigs infected with TTSuV in Brazilian herds. This study evaluated the frequency of TTSuV infection in pigs at different stages of production. Fecal samples (n=190)from pigs at 1 to 24 weeks of age and from breeders at 6 farrow-to-weaning (up to 8 weeksof age) and 9 grower-to-finish (9 weeks of age onwards) farms in the western region of Paraná state, Brazil, were evaluated by PCR. Fragments of the 5' UTRs of TTSuV1 and/or TTSuVk2 DNAs were identified in 126 (66.3%) of the fecal samples. Significant differences were found with the percentages of positive samples for TTSuV1, TTSuVk2, and mixed infections by both genera between and within the different pig production stages. Fecal samples from the grower-to-finish farms had TTSuV detection rates (90.1%; 64/71) that were significantly (p<0.05) higher than those from the farrow-to-weaning farms (52.1%; 62/119). TTSuV detection was significantly (p<0.05) more frequent in finisher pigs than in the animals from the other stages. The UTR nucleotide sequences in this study presented higher similarities to strains from Norway (96%, TTSuV1), and Argentina and China (97.1%, TTSuVk2). These results suggest that TTSuV infection has spread to pigs of all production stages and that the viral infection rate increases with the age of the animals. In the western region of Paraná state, Brazil, TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2-induced infections were more frequently observed in suckling piglets and finisher pigs, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis pointed out the possibility of different strains of TTSuV1 and TTSuVk2 circulating in pig herds of Brazil.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV1-2), members of the newly established family Anelloviridae are considered non-pathogenic emerging viral agents of Suidae species. However, the genetic diversity, phylogeny and evolutionary processes responsible for the emergence and spread of TTSuVs in wild boars remain poorly understood. Here we implemented phylogenetic and evolutionary analyses to address key questions on the genetic diversity, evolutionary scenario and spatio-temporal dynamics of emerging TTSuVs in wild boars of the Western region (Transylvania) of Romania. High levels of genetic diversity of wild boar origin TTSuV1-2 have been found as well as a new TTSuV1 genotype and several new subtypes. Phylogenies suggest that several wild boar viral strains in both TTSuV species are likely to have emerged from a well-defined ancestor approximately 40 (TTSuV1) and 18 (TTSuV2) years ago and showed independent evolutionary trajectories. Bayesian phylogeography showed an intense flow of viral strains throughout the Transylvanian counties possibly related to wild host migrations, facilitating the rapid spread of TTSuVs. The intra-genotype and inter- and intrahost level recombination, intense spatio-temporal viral flow and the positively selected sites found in the ORF2 genes should be considered important driving forces shaping TTSuVs evolution. The first reported rates of nucleotide substitution for porcine anelloviruses, estimated to be 5.29-5.51×10-4subs site-1year-1, are in line with those measured previously for mammalian ssDNA viruses and RNA viruses. These high evolutionary rates of TTSuVs, independent of recombination, are reflections of adaptive evolution, an important factor in the emergence of novel viral variants which may explain their ability to emerge in Suidae hosts. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - To date, there have been only few studies that investigated integration of anal Human Papillomavirus (HPV). Most of them were conducted on HIV-infected individuals and mainly analyzed samples from high-grade lesions and invasive cancer. We aimed to investigate HPV physical status in HIV-negative men who have sex with men (MSM) with a detectable anal HPV infection, irrespective of the presence of lesions. We also sought to explore the presence of other circular DNA viruses in the anal region. Study participants were attendees of an STI screening program, which were also screened for anal HPV infection and cytological abnormalities. HPV physical status was assessed using multiply-primed RCA. HPV16-positive samples were also analyzed using E2/E6 multiplex PCR, qRT-PCR and APOT assay. RCA and virus-specific PCR were employed to investigate the presence of other DNA viruses. Anal HPV infection was detected in 76.9% of the 230 MSM enrolled. The anal cytological reports were: 129 NILM, 37 ASC-US and 28 L-SIL (36 samples were inadequate for interpretation). HPV physical status was evaluated in the 109 anal specimens that harbored one or two different HPV genotypes. Integration was observed only in one HPV16-positive sample (0.9%), in which integrate-derived viral transcripts of type B were detected. Integration occurred in chromosome 14 q. In 22 of the 53 (41.5%) mucosal HPV-negative samples, RCA restriction results would seem to indicate the presence of circular DNA viruses. Indeed, cutaneous HPV (4 samples), MCPyV (5 samples) and TTV (4 samples) were detected. In conclusion, anal HPV integration was rarely evidenced in HIV-uninfected MSM with no or mild anal cytological abnormalities, although the integration rate may have been underestimated because of the limitations of the employed assays. Other DNA viruses were detected in the anal samples of these individuals, although the significance of this occurrence needs to be assessed. © 2013 Donà et al.

AB  - Although torque teno viruses are frequently detected in humans and animals the pathogenicity and virulence of these viruses are currently unknown, and little information on the dynamics of infection is available. In this study, 24. pigs were monitored from 2. weeks of age to slaughter to determine the natural infection dynamics of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species 1 (TTSuV1) and species 2 (TTSuV2). Plasma and fecal material were collected at 2, 8 and 18. weeks of age and between 22 and 29. weeks of age, while organs and tissues were collected at slaughter. Both viruses were found to disseminate very quickly within the herd. At 8weeks, TTSuV2 and TTSuV1 were observed at rates of 88% and 58%, respectively, and peak excretion occurred at 18weeks. Furthermore, TTSuV DNA was detected in the plasma of between 96% and 100% of the animals, and viremia was maintained at a viral load between 5×104 and 5×106copies/mL until slaughter. All tested organs and tissues contained TTSuVs in amounts ranging from 103 to 108copies/g; the highest concentration of viruses was found in the liver. This study did not demonstrate any association with disease, despite the high prevalence of TTSuVs. © 2013.

AB  - An unexplained increase in the incidence of parapneumonic empyema (PPE) in pneumonia cases has been reported in recent years. The present study investigated the genetic and biological specifications of new isolates of torque teno mini virus (TTMV) detected in pleural effusion samples from children hospitalised for severe pneumonia with PPE. A pathogen discovery protocol was applied in undiagnosed pleural effusion samples and led to the identification of three new isolates of TTMV (TTMV-LY). Isolated TTMV-LY genomes were transfected into A549 and human embryonic kidney 293T cells and viral replication was assessed by quantitative realtime PCR and full-length genome amplification. A549 cells were further infected with released TTMV-LY virions and the induced-innate immune response was measured by multiplex immunoassays. Genetic analyses of the three TTMV-LY genomes revealed a classic genomic organisation but a weak identity (,64%) with known sequences. We demonstrated the in vitro replication of TTMV-LY in alveolar epithelial cells and the effective release of infectious viral particles. We also showed a selective production of inflammatory mediators in response to TTMV infection. This study reports the description of replicative TTMV-LY isolated from parapneumonic effusions of children hospitalised with PPE, suggesting a potential role of the virus in the pathogenesis of pneumonia.

AB  - Viral pathogen discovery is of critical importance to clinical microbiology, infectious diseases, and public health. Genomic approaches for pathogen discovery, including consensus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), microarrays, and unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS), have the capacity to comprehensively identify novel microbes present in clinical samples. Although numerous challenges remain to be addressed, including the bioinformatics analysis and interpretation of large datasets, these technologies have been successful in rapidly identifying emerging outbreak threats, screening vaccines and other biological products for microbial contamination, and discovering novel viruses associated with both acute and chronic illnesses. Downstream studies such as genome assembly, epidemiologic screening, and a culture system or animal model of infection are necessary to establish an association of a candidate pathogen with disease. © 2013 The Author.

AB  - Globalization and industrialization have dramatically altered the vulnerability of human and animal populations to emerging and reemerging infectious diseases while shifting both the scale and pace of disease outbreaks. Fortunately, the advent of high-throughput DNA sequencing platforms has also increased the speed with which such pathogens can be detected and characterized as part of an outbreak response effort. It is now possible to sequence the genome of a pathogen rapidly, inexpensively, and with high sensitivity, transforming the fields of diagnostics, surveillance, forensic analysis, and pathogenesis. Here, we review advances in methods for microbial discovery and characterization, as well as strategies for testing the clinical and public health significance of microbe-disease associations. Finally, we discuss how genetic data can inform our understanding of the general process of pathogen emergence. Copyright © 2013 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved.

AB  - Human health has a significant importance and it is directly affected by a number of factors like different diseases including microbial and viral infections. Up till now we have paid attention to the disease causing viruses and pathogens and less has been investigated about the usefulness of normal viral flora. One such orphan virus is Torque Teno Virus (TTV). The virus is present in healthy as well as diseased population, indicating its high prevalence. The virus is ubiquitous to human body as it is present in almost all tissues and organs and this is the property that can be utilized for targeted drug delivery. Another potentially useful property of this virus is TTV derived Apoptosis Inducing protein that can be a hope for the affectees. © 2013 Bostan N, et al.

AB  - Members of the family Anelloviridae are emerging circular DNA viruses infecting many species of vertebrates including pigs. To date, members of two distinct genera, Iotatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus 1a and torque teno sus virus 1b (TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), and Kappatorquevirus, including torque teno sus virus k2a and torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b), have been identified in domestic pigs and wild boars. The goal of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and genetic diversity of these viruses based on 5' non-coding genes in Chinese swine herds experiencing clinical symptoms. One hundred eighty-five clinical samples from 11 different regions, collected during 2008-2009, were analyzed using a PCR method, and the results revealed a high TTSuV-positive rate of 78.9 % (146/185) in pigs. Moreover, we detected co-infection with multiple TTSuV strains in the same pig. Nucleotide sequencing results revealed greater genetic diversity within the genus Kappatorquevirus than within the genus Iotatorquevirus. In addition, TTSuVk2b, a novel virus discovered in New Zealand in 2012, was also identified in this study. In summary, the present work helps us obtain more knowledge about the epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTSuVs. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - Objectives: Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) is classified as the Betatorquevirus genus of Anelloviridae. Little is known about the prevalence of TTMV in humans. Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer affecting women. This study aimed to estimate the TTMV infection frequency in cervicitis cases and cervical tumors including intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma, and the possible role of this virus in the etiology of them in an Isfahan population. Methods: 79 cervicitis cases and 42 tumors were collected from histopathological files of Al-Zahra Hospital in Isfahan, Iran. DNA was extracted and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: Totally 62% of the tested samples were positive for TTMV. It was positive in 52.4% of adenocarcinoma, 68.4% of CIN and 100% SCC cases. In cervicitis, 48% of the cases were positive. In the phylogenetic construct two of the cervical tumor isolates and two of the cervicitis isolates were placed in the same cluster with already reported isolates from Japan (EF538880 and AB041962). Also, three of the cervical tumors isolated (JQ734980, JQ734981 and JQ734982) were placed in another cluster. Conclusion: The presence of the virus in cervical tissues suggests possible sexual transmission of the virus. Copyright © 2013 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review will explore two new aspects of the involvement of viruses in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis. The first aspect is the complex interactions between viruses. The second aspect is the proposal of a mechanism by which autoreactive T cells are able to escape thymic selection and potentially recognize self and a pathogen. RECENT FINDINGS: With regard to viruses, recent work has demonstrated that one virus may enhance the replication of another virus, potentially leading to an increase in inflammation and disease progression. Also, interactions between human endogenous retroviruses, which likely do not replicate, and certain herpes viruses, may also play a role in disease pathogenesis. Mechanistically, T cells expressing dual T-cell receptors would be able to recognize self and a foreign antigen specifically. Therefore, human endogenous retroviruses potentially play a role in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis, and both interactions between multiple viruses and autoreactive CD8 T cells with dual T-cell receptors may play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. SUMMARY: The complex interactions between multiple viral infections, either within the central nervous system or in the periphery, and the host immune response to viral infection may be such that a variety of viral specificities result in the activation of T cells that recognize self and induce multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is unlikely that any one microbe will be determined to be the causative agent of multiple sclerosis as reflected by the number of potential triggering mechanisms of the disease. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health / Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV) during blood screening has helped to prevent transfusion-transmitted HBV infection (TT-HBV) in Japan. Nevertheless, 4 to 13 TT-HBV infections arise annually. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The Japanese Red Cross (JRC) analyzed repository samples of donated blood for TT-HBV that was suspected through hemovigilance. Blood donations implicated in TT-HBV infections were categorized as either window period (WP) or occult HBV infection (OBI) related. In addition, we analyzed blood from 4742 donors with low antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs) titers using individual-donation NAT (ID-NAT) to investigate the relationship between anti-HBc titer and proportion of viremic donors. RESULTS: Introduction of a more sensitive NAT method for screening minipools of 20 donations increased the OBI detection rate from 3.9 to 15.2 per million, while also the confirmed OBI transmission rate increased from 0.67 to 1.49 per million. By contrast the WP transmission rate decreased from 0.92 to 0.46 per million. Testing repository samples of donations missed by minipools of 20 donations NAT showed that 75 and 85% of TT-HBV that arose from WP and OBI donations, respectively, would have been interdicted by ID-NAT. The ID-NAT trial revealed that 1.94% of donations with low anti-HBc and anti-HBs titers were viremic and that anti-HBc titers and the frequency of viremia did not correlate. CONCLUSIONS: The JRC has elected to achieve maximal safety by discarding all units with low anti-HBc and anti-HBs titers that account for 1.3% of the total donations. © 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - Background: Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are non-enveloped viruses and have single-stranded, negative sense circular DNA genomes and are widely distributed in pigs. But till now, the prevalence of TTSuVs with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) in pig herds of China is not very clear; and the genetic variation among different TTSuVs isolate is very large and need to divide the subgroups. In this study, the co-infection with TTSuVs and porcine circovrius (PCV) in the pig population of China was investigated and the subgroups of all TTSuVs genomes in Genbank were divided. Results: Results showed that the rate of co-infection with TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 reached 75% in PCV2-positive samples. Also Two TTSuV1 and four TTSuV2 isolates genome sequences were obtained, and the similarity of all TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 genomic sequences in GenBank were compared. Phylogenetic trees indicated that both the TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 sequences could be divided into four genotypes. Interestingly, the sub-genotypes TTSuV1d, TTSuV2c and TTSuV2d exist only in the pig population of China. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that co-infection with TTSuVs and PCVs is very common in the pig population of China, in which the viruses maybe contribute to clinical diseases cooperatively. In addition, three new subgroups of TTSuVs emerged in China for the first time and a high level of variation among different isolates of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was indicated by their genetic diversity. © 2013 Liu et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Abstract. Background: Quantification of titers of ubiquitous viruses such as Torque teno virus (TTV) that do not cause clinical symptoms might be helpful in assessing the immune status of an individual. We hereby describe the validation of a SYBR Green-based TTV quantification method for plasma samples. Methods. Plasmids with TTV specific inserts were used for preparing standards and absolute quantification of TTV was performed using SYBR Green methodology. The method was assessed for its accuracy and precision (intra and inter-day) on four non-consecutive days. TTV was also quantified from plasma samples of 20 healthy volunteers and from 30 hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. Results: The assay was specific and showed satisfactory efficiency (82.2%, R§ssup§2§esup§=0.99) with the limit of quantification defined as 100 copies per reaction. The assay had good precision (inter and intra-day coefficient of variation in cycle threshold (C§ssub§T§esub§) < 4%) and accuracy (100 ± 10%) in the range of 100 to 10§ssup§10§esup§ copies/reaction. We found TTV loads ranging from 2.5 - 4.07 log copies/mL of plasma with C§ssub§T§esub§ (mean ± SD) of 33.8 ± 1.77 in healthy individuals and 2.06 - 8.49 log copies/mL of plasma with C§ssub§T§esub§ (mean ± SD) of 24.3 ± 1.04 in HSCT recipients. Conclusion: SYBR Green-based q-PCR assay combines simplicity with satisfactory sensitivity and may be suitable for monitoring the immune status of transplant recipients, where TTV loads over time may serve as a marker for immune reconstitution in human plasma samples. © 2013 Tyagi et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The aim of this work is to identify antigenic regions within the ORF1 protein of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno virus sus 2 (TTSuV2) that could be used as antigens to detect virus-specific antibodies following infection in pigs. Protein sequences of TTSuV ORF1 genes were analysed to predict linear antigenic epitopes. Synthesized peptides were analysed for serological reactivity with swine sera. Such an antigenic region was identified at the C terminus of the ORF1 protein of both viruses and showed serological reactivity with 78% (TTSuV1) and 88% (TTSuV2) of swine sera. An ELISA with an immunodominant peptide as antigen was used to examine the sera of piglets, aged 4-20 weeks, and adults. Results indicated that TTSuV1- and TTSuV2-specific antibodies were detectable at 4 weeks. Antibody titres increased from week 10 and peaked at week 20. A relatively high antibody titre persisted to adulthood. © 2013 SGM.

AB  - In the present study, Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) were detected in tissue and blood samples obtained from domestic pigs in central China, and complete genomes of TTSuVs were characterized. A total of three tissue samples (3/20, 15 %) from post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome-affected pigs and 30 blood samples (30/40, 75 %) from healthy pigs were positive for Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and/or 2 (TTSuV2). Two TTSuV strains (TTV1Hn54 and TTV2Hn93) comprising 2,794 and 2,875 nucleotides, respectively, each had four open reading frames (ORFs) and the untranslated region with TATA box and GC-rich region. Genomic sequence of TTV2Hn93 strain was unique in length compared with other TTSuV2 genomic sequences. Interestingly, three rolling-circle replication (RCR) motif-IIIs (YXXK) which were located at amino acid (aa) position 166-169, 328-331, and 379-382, respectively, were found in the ORF1 of TTV1Hn54. Two RCR motif-IIIs (YXXK) at the aa position 105-108 and 480-483 respectively, were also identified in the ORF1 of TTV2Hn93. Phylogenetic tree based on complete genomes showed that TTV1Hn54 strain was designated into type TTSuV1b and had a slight high sequence identity of 91 % with the Canada strain (JQ120664). TTV2Hn93 strain was classified into subtype TTSuV2d and shared the highest identity (97 %) with the Spain strain (GU570207). © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - The aims of this study were to evaluate torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) infection in healthy slaughter-age pigs and to compare the similarities of the untranslated region (UTR) nucleotide (nt) sequences obtained from different biological samples of the same animals. Fifty-eight pigs were evaluated by PCR assay for the presence of TTSuV in paired samples of liver and serum (Group 1, n = 27) and lung and serum (Group 2, n = 31). All the pigs were positive for TTSuV infection in the organs sampled and 94.8 % (n = 55) presented with viraemia. The nt sequence similarities between the Groups 1 and 2 varied from 91.7 % to 96.6 % (TTSuV1) and 91 % to 95 % (TTSuV2). In Group 1, the nt sequence similarities were 93 % (TTSuV1) and 95.4 % (TTSuV2). In Group 2, the nt sequence similarities were 95 % (TTSuV1) and 91 % (TTSuV2). These results revealed the simultaneous infection with distinct strains of TTSuV1 and 2 in healthy pigs at slaughter age. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Background There are little data on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevalence, incidence, or residual risks for transfusion-transmitted HIV infection among Chinese blood donors. Study Design and Methods Donations from five Chinese blood centers in 2008 to 2010 were screened using two rounds of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for anti-HIV-1/2. A reactive result in either or both rounds led to Western blot confirmatory testing. HIV prevalence among first-time donors and incidence among repeat donors were examined. Weighted multivariable logistic regression analysis examined correlates of HIV confirmatory status among first-time donors. Residual risks were evaluated based on incidence among repeat donors. Results Among 821,320 donations, 40% came from repeat donors. A total of 1837 (0.34%) first-time and 577 (0.17%) repeat donations screened reactive, among which 1310 and 419 were tested by Western blot. A total of 233 (17.7%) first-time and 44 (10.5%) repeat donations were confirmed positive. Prevalence was 66 infections per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI], 59-74) first-time donors. Incidence was 9 of 100,000 (95% CI, 7-12) person-years among repeat donors. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicates that first-time donors 26 to 45 years old were 1.6 to 1.8 times likely to be HIV positive than those 25 years and younger. Donors with some college or above education were less likely to be HIV positive than those with middle school education, odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 0.35 to 0.60. Minorities were 1.5 times likely to be HIV positive than Han majority donors (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.1). HIV residual risk was 5.4 (95% CI, 1.2-12.5) infections per million whole blood donations. Conclusion Despite the declining HIV epidemic in China, estimated residual risks for transfusion-transmitted HIV infection are still high. © 2012 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - Background: Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), infecting domestic swine and wild boar, is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. which has been classified into the genera Iotatorquevirus (TTSuV1) and Kappatorquevirus (TTSuV2) of the family Anelloviridae. A molecular study was conducted to detect evidence of a phylogenic relationship between these two porcine TTSuV genogroups from the sera of 244 infected pigs located in 21 subordinate prefectures and/or cities of Sichuan. Results: Both genogroups of TTSuV were detected in pig sera collected from all 21 regions examined. Of the 244 samples, virus from either genogroup was detected in 203 (83.2%), while 44 animals (18.0%) were co-infected with viruses of both genogroups. Moreover, TTSuV2 (186/244, 76.2%) was more prevalent than TTSuV1 (61/244, 25%). There was statistically significant difference between the prevalence of genogroups 1 infection alone (9.4%, 23/244) and 2 alone (64.8%, 158/244), and between the prevalence of genogroups 2 (76.2%, 186/244) and both genogroups co-infection (18.0%, 44/244). The untranslated region of the swine TTSuV genome was found to be an adequate molecular marker of the virus for detection and surveillance. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both genogroups 1 and 2 could be further divided into two subtypes, subtype a and b. TTSuV1 subtype b and the two TTSuV2 subtypes are more prevalent in Sichuan Province. Conclusions: Our study presents detailed geographical evidence of TTSuV infection in China. © 2013 Mei et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Pathogens are possible risk factors for chronic degenerative diseases of the nervous system. This paper summarizes the evidence of infectious agents' relationship with neurodegenerative diseases and current knowledge about the role of pathogens in the modulation of immunological mechanism in the most common degenerative diseases: Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease and multiple sclerosis. Infections with Chlamydia pneumoniae, Herpes simplex virus type 1, spirochaete and Helicobacter pylori may constitute risk factors for the Alzheimer disease. Human immunodeficiency virus and Toxoplasma gondii in the brain can cause parkinsonism. Epstein-Barr virus and co-infection with Torque teno virus as well as Human herpes virus type 6 and Chlamydia pneumoniae may play a role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

AB  - The present work was aimed to investigate the torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and 2) loads of different tissues of pigs affected by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-systemic disease (PCV2-SD) and healthy age-matched ones. A total of 20 pigs (10 healthy and 10 diagnosed as PCV2-SD) were chosen for the study. From each pig, a total of 7 tissues were analyzed, including lung, kidney, liver, ileum, bone marrow, and mesenteric and mediastinal lymph nodes. TTSuV 1 and 2 were quantified by means of species-specific real time quantitative PCR methods. Both TTSuVs were distributed systemically. Results showed the highest loads for TTSuV2 in tissues from diseased pigs. The highest TTSuV1 DNA load was found in bone marrow, lung, and liver, while it was in bone marrow, mediastinal lymph node and liver for TTSuV2. Bone marrow was the tissue with the highest viral DNA burden for both TTSuV species. Overall, statistically significant differences were observed in viral DNA load, with TTSuV2 showing higher loads than TTSuV1 (p<0.05). Also, tissues from PCVD-SD affected pigs showed higher TTSuV2 loads than tissues of the healthy group (p<0.05). It was concluded that both TTSuVs had a wide tissue distribution all over the body, with differential load comparing diseased versus healthy pigs. It is likely that other tissues not included in this study would also be infected by TTSuVs. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background Donors with short interdonation intervals (e.g., apheresis donors) have an increased risk of window period donations. The frequency of cytomegalovirus (CMV) window period donations is important information to decide whether selection of seronegative donors might be advantageous for patients at risk for transfusion-transmitted CMV infections (TT-CMV). Study Design and Methods CMV seroconversion in 93 donors with positive results in routine CMV antibody testing within at most 35 days after the last seronegative sample was evaluated by Western blot and/or a second antibody test. In donors with unconfirmed seroconversion, an additional later sample was tested. Concentration of CMV DNA was determined in pre- and postseroconversion samples. Results CMV seroconversion was confirmed in 12 donors (13%). Among these, the last seronegative sample was CMV DNA positive in three donors (25%, below 30 IU/mL). The first seropositive sample was CMV DNA positive in 10 donors (83%, maximum 1600 IU/mL). Both prevalence and median concentration of CMV DNA were higher in the first seropositive sample (p = 0.004 and p = 0.02), with maximum concentrations being reached about 2 weeks after seroconversion. No CMV DNA was detected in samples from donors with unconfirmed seroconversion. Conclusion At least in donors with short interdonation intervals, most suspected CMV seroconversions are due to false-positive results of the screening test. As window period donations are rare and contain less CMV DNA than the first seropositive donation, avoidance of blood products from primarily seropositive donors is especially helpful to avoid TT-CMV if donors with short interdonation intervals are concerned. © 2013 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - Polymorphisms in IL6, ACE and ATR genes are associated with obesity. Torque Teno virus (TTV) seems to be able to interfere with production of some proinflammatory cytokines associated with obesity and related phenotypes. The aim of this study was to test the potential association between obesity, TTV infection and the IL6 G-174C (rs1800795), ACE I/D (rs4646994), AT1R A1166C (rs5186) polymorphisms. The polymorphisms and the presence of TTV were detected in blood samples from 150 obese and 150 normal-weight, healthy subjects using PCR based methods. IL6-174 CC genotype was more frequent in all obese patients (P=0. 02) and in patients without TTV infections (P=0. 03) than in controls. Obese women had more frequent TTV infections compared with normal-weight women (P=0. 046). Obese subjects, regardless of gender (women P=0. 03, men P=0. 04), and healthy normal-weight men (P<0. 01) carriers of AT1R C allele had higher triglycerides levels compared with non-carriers. The frequency of TTV in the control group (70. 67%) was similar to data reported in other populations. The present study indicated that IL6-174 CC genotype and TTV infections in women could be associated with the common form of obesity. © 2013 Versita Warsaw and Springer-Verlag Wien.

AB  - We conducted an unbiased metagenomics survey using plasma from patients with chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and patients without liver disease (control). RNA and DNA libraries were sequenced from plasma filtrates enriched in viral particles to catalog virus populations. Hepatitis viruses were readily detected at high coverage in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C, but only a limited number of sequences resembling other viruses were found. The exception was a library from a patient diagnosed with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection that contained multiple sequences matching GB virus C (GBV-C). Abundant GBV-C reads were also found in plasma from patients with AIH, whereas Torque teno virus (TTV) was found at high frequency in samples from patients with AIH and NASH. After taxonomic classification of sequences by BLASTn, a substantial fraction in each library, ranging from 35% to 76%, remained unclassified. These unknown sequences were assembled into scaffolds along with virus, phage and endogenous retrovirus sequences and then analyzed by BLASTx against the non-redundant protein database. Nearly the full genome of a heretofore-unknown circovirus was assembled and many scaffolds that encoded proteins with similarity to plant, insect and mammalian viruses. The presence of this novel circovirus was confirmed by PCR. BLASTx also identified many polypeptides resembling nucleo-cytoplasmic large DNA viruses (NCLDV) proteins. We re-evaluated these alignments with a profile hidden Markov method, HHblits, and observed inconsistencies in the target proteins reported by the different algorithms. This suggests that sequence alignments are insufficient to identify NCLDV proteins, especially when these alignments are only to small portions of the target protein. Nevertheless, we have now established a reliable protocol for the identification of viruses in plasma that can also be adapted to other patient samples such as urine, bile, saliva and other body fluids. © 2013 Law et al.

AB  - The complex genetic susceptibility for breast cancer includes highly penetrating and lowpenetrating genetic markers. eNOS (7q36), ACE (17q23) and AGTR1 (3q24) are candidate loci for breast cancer. The aim of this study was to test the potential association of eNOS 4ab, ACE ID, AGTR1 A1166T polymorphisms and Torque teno virus (TTV) infections with sporadic breast cancer in Romania. For this case-control study were selected women with sporadic breast cancer (n=100) and healthy women (n=100). The eNOS 4ab, ACE ID, AGTR1 A1166T polymorphisms and presence of TTV DNA were assessed by PCR-based protocols. The polymorphisms' distribution was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. No significant association with breast cancer was found for investigated polymorphisms considered individually or in combinations of two or three markers (p>0.05). TTV infections were more frequent in cancer patients than in control (84% vs. 60%, p=0.00016). A preferential distribution of TTV in patients with sporadic breast cancer, especially in those carrying eNOS bb genotype (OR=4.88, 95%CI: 2.01- 11.9, p=0.00025) or ACE I variant (OR=4.07, 95%CI: 1.85- 8.97, p=0.0003), was observed. This study revealed a preferential distribution of TTV infections in women with sporadic breast cancer, carriers of eNOS bb genotype or ACE I variant.©2013 University of Bucharest.

AB  - The current study tested the benefit of commercially available spray-dried bovine colostrum (The Saskatoon Colostrum Company, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan) in raising snatch-farrowed, porcine-colostrum-deprived (SF-pCD) pigs. In experiment 1, 12 SF-pCD pigs received a liquid diet composed mainly of bovine colostrum from birth to day 10; 6 remained on the same liquid diet (COL), and the other 6 were fed a diet composed mainly of milk replacer (RPL) until weaning. In experiment 2, 12 SF-pCD pigs were fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning; after weaning, 6 were fed a starter diet containing 20% (w/w) bovine colostrum powder (STARTER-COL), and the other 6 were fed a starter diet without any bovine colostrum (STARTER-CTRL) until termination (day 42 or day 49). In experiment 1 the COL pigs had significantly fewer fever-days than did the RPL pigs. In experiment 2 diarrhea, typhlocolitis, and pancreatic degeneration developed in 4 of the STARTER-COL pigs after weaning. In both experiments all the pigs fed mainly bovine colostrum before weaning survived until termination. All pigs tested free of swine influenza virus H1N1 and H3N2, Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, and Porcine parvovirus. In experiment 2 all the pigs tested free of Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), but some in both groups tested positive for Torque teno virus genogroups 1 and 2. In conclusion, with the use of snatch-farrowing and bovine colostrum, pigs can be raised in the absence of porcine maternal antibodies with 100% survival and freedom from most porcine pathogens of biologic relevance. This model is potentially suitable for animal disease research.

AB  - The pathogenic role of Torque teno sus viruses 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), and their capacity to induce lesions are controversial. TTSuVs have been linked to porcine circovirus diseases (PCVDs) and described as cause of mild respiratory lesions in gnotobiotic pigs; moreover, an increased TTSuV prevalence has been found in porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) affected pigs. In the present study, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 loads and their prevalence were evaluated in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) lung samples displaying different types of inflammatory lesions. Such measurements were made by means of a real time quantitative PCR technique to detect these viruses. The technique was optimised for its use on FFPE tissues comparing results with frozen lung tissues. Selection criteria included negativity against porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), Aujeszky's disease virus (ADV) and swine influenza virus (SIV). Results from the present study demonstrated that both TTSuVs were present in lung. However, TTSuV2 had higher viral load and prevalence in all the studied groups when compared to TTSuV1. TTSuV2 mean load was also higher in lungs with viral background (interstitial pneumonia and broncho-interstitial pneumonia) when compared to normal lungs or to those with bacterial background (catarrhal-purulent bronchopneumonia, fibrinous pleuritis and fibrinous-necrotizing pleuropneumonia). This result suggests a possible role of TTSuV2 in the pathogenic mechanism of inflammatory lesions of lungs compatible with viral infection. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) are considered non-pathogenic viruses, although lately they have been linked to porcine circovirus diseases, mainly with post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). These associations point out a possible pathogenic role of TTSuVs or, alternatively, that TTSuV replication is up-regulated under disease conditions. In order to further explore the association of TTSuVs with disease occurrence, TTSuVs prevalence and viral load were assessed before and after an experimental infection with a highly pathogenic classical swine fever (CSF) virus (CSFV) isolate. Serum samples from 56 animals were analyzed by means of a real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 before and after (between 6 and 13 days post-inoculation) the CSFV challenge. Based on the post-infection clinical evolution and immune response against CSFV, the animals were divided into two groups: group I, with protecting immunity against CSFV and no clinical signs at the day of necropsy, and group II, with no detectable immune response against CSFV and moderate to severe clinical signs. TTSuVs qPCR results indicated that TTSuV2 and not TTSuV1 load in serum increased significantly after challenge with CSFV in the group of pigs with clinical signs, specifically in those with a moderate course of the disease. Therefore, this study emphasizes the different behaviour of both TTSuVs, as already found in the PMWS background, and further supports the association of TTSuV2 with disease occurrence. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Chronic hepatitis B and C virus infections are universally accepted as causes of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatitis A and E viruses cause only acute self-limiting infections of the liver. Of the remaining hepatitis viruses - Delta hepatitis, hepatitis G (GB-C), TT and SEN - all have at some time been incriminated as causes of hepatocellular carcinoma. Delta hepatitis virus requires helper functions from hepatitis B virus to become invasive. Chronic Delta/hepatitis B viral co-infection runs a more severe course than that resulting from chronic hepatitis B virus infection alone, with progression to cirrhosis being more likely and more rapid. A substantial majority of the early studies did not find an increased incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma in co-infected individuals. But more recently, an increased incidence of the tumour has been recorded more often than no increase. Further studies are needed to draw a firm conclusion with regard to the hepatocarcinogenic effect of dual Delta/hepatitis B virus co-infection. With one exception, no published study (of 13) has incriminated chronic infection with hepatitis G virus as a cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. The dissenting study, published in 1999, was the only one performed in the United States. Fewer studies of the hepatocarcinogenic effect of TT virus have been performed. Apart from one study, published in 1999, no convincing evidence is available that supports a causal role for TT virus in hepatocarcinogenesis. The exception was in Japanese patients with high hepatitis C viral loads but independent of chronic hepatitis C virus infection. No evidence has been produced to indicate that SEN virus causes hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In our world, which is faced today with exceptional environmental changes and dramatically intensifying globalisation, we are encountering challenges due to many new factors, including the emergence or re-emergence of novel, so far " unknown" infectious diseases. Although a broad arsenal of diagnostic methods is at our disposal, the majority of the conventional diagnostic tests is highly virus-specific or is targeted entirely towards a limited group of infectious agents. This specificity complicates or even hinders the detection of new or unexpected pathogens, such as new, emerging or re-emerging viruses or novel viral variants. The recently developed approaches of viral metagenomics provide an effective novel way to screen samples and detect viruses without previous knowledge of the infectious agent, thereby enabling a better diagnosis and disease control, in line with the " One World, One Health" principles (www.oneworldonehealth.org). Using metagenomic approaches, we have recently identified a broad variety of new viruses, such as novel bocaviruses, Torque Teno viruses, astroviruses, rotaviruses and kobuviruses in porcine disease syndromes, new virus variants in honeybee populations, as well as a range of other infectious agents in further host species. These findings indicate that the metagenomic detection of viral pathogens is becoming now a powerful, cultivation-independent, and useful novel diagnostic tool in veterinary diagnostic virology. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) have been potentially related to liver diseases. The aim of the study was to quantify TTV and TTMV in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/hepatitis C virus (HCV)-coinfected patients to study the relationship between the TTV and TTMV viral loads and the severity of liver disease. We carried out a cross-sectional study in 245 patients coinfected with HIV and HCV (HIV/HCV-group), 114 patients monoinfected with HIV (HIV-group), and 100 healthy blood donors (Control-group). Plasma samples were tested for TTV and TTMV by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalences of TTV and TTMV infections in the HIV/HCV-group and the HIV-group were significantly higher than the Control-group (p < 0.05). Furthermore, TTV and TTMV coinfections were found in 92.2 % (226/245) in the HIV/HCV-group, 84.2 % (96/114) in the HIV-group, and 63 % (63/100 %) in the Control-group (p ≤ 0.05). HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with HIV viral load ≥50 copies/mL and patients with severe activity grade had the highest viral loads of TTV and TTMV (p ≤ 0.05). HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with high TTV load (>2.78 log copies/μL) had increased odds of having advanced fibrosis or severe necroinflammatory activity grade in the liver biopsy. Moreover, HIV/HCV-coinfected patients with high TTMV load (>1.88 log copies/μL) had decreased odds of having no/minimal fibrosis and no/mild activity grade, and increased odds of having a high fibrosis progression rate. In conclusion, TTV and TTMV might play a role in the development of liver disease in immunodeficiency patients, such as the patients coinfected with HIV and HCV. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) circulate widely among humans, causing persistent viraemia in healthy individuals. Numerous TTV isolates with high genetic variability have been identified and segregated into 29 species of five major phylogenetic groups. To date, the diversity of TTV sequences, challenges in protein expression and the subsequent lack of serological assays have hampered TTV seroprevalence studies. Moreover, the antigenic relationships of different TTVs and their specific seroprevalences in humans remain unknown. For five TTV strains - belonging to different species of four genogroups - we developed, using recombinant glutathione S-transferase (GST)-fused TTV ORF2 proteins, glutathione-GST capture enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) detecting antibodies towards conformational epitopes. We then analysed serum samples from 178 healthy adults and 108 children; IgG reactivities were observed either towards a single strain or towards multiple strains, which pointed to antigenic distinction of TTV species. The overall seroprevalence for the five TTVs peaked at 43% (18 of 42) in children 2-4 years of age, subsequently declined, and again reached 42% (74 of 178) among adults. TTV6 species-specific IgG predominated in children, whereas that for TTV13 predominated in adults. During a 3 year follow-up of the same children, both species-specific seroconversions and seroreversions occurred. This is the first EIA-based study of different TTVs, providing a new approach for seroepidemiology and diagnosis of TTV infections. Our data suggest that different TTVs in humans may differ in antiviral antibody profiles, infection patterns and epidemiology. © 2013 SGM.

AB  - Hepatitis is a feature of many viral diseases usually resulting as a part of generalised infection which involves the liver. In contrast, there are at least five different hepatitis viruses (HAV to HEV) that primarily target the liver in humans- called hepatitis viruses, whereas the role of sixth virus (HGV) is doubtful. Although symptoms produced are similar, these viruses differ greatly in their structure, mode of replication and transmission. The aim of this article is to bring out salient features of these viruses and approach towards their control/ prevention, laying emphasis on HBV which has attained/ become one of major public health problems in India.

AB  - Aims: To evaluate and compare the reductions of human viruses and F-specific coliphages in a full-scale wastewater treatment plant based on the quantitative PCR (qPCR) and plate count assays. Methods and Results: A total of 24 water samples were collected from four locations at the plant, and the relative abundance of human viruses and F-RNA phage genogroups were determined by qPCR. Of the 10 types of viruses tested, enteric adenoviruses were the most prevalent in both influent and effluent wastewater samples. Of the different treatment steps, the activated sludge process was most effective in reducing the microbial loads. Viruses and F-RNA phages showed variable reduction; among them, GI and GIII F-RNA phages showed the lowest and the highest reduction, respectively. Conclusions: Ten types of viruses were present in wastewater that is discharged into public water bodies after treatment. The variability in reduction for the different virus types demonstrates that selection of adequate viral indicators is important for evaluating the efficacy of wastewater treatment and ensuring the water safety. Significance and Impact of the Study: Our comprehensive analyses of the occurrence and reduction of viruses and indicators can contribute to the future establishment of appropriate viral indicators to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater treatment. © 2012 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

AB  - This paper presents information on swine dysentery and swine proliferative enteropathy. The role of porcine Torque teno virus (TTSuV) and porcine astrovirus (PAstV) in the etiology of grow-finish pigs is . also mentioned. The review is based on the presentations from the 22nd International Pig Veterinary Society ; Congress, which took place in June 2012 in South Korea. The etiological significance of Brachyspira species was characterized: Brachyspira (B.) hyodysenteriae is a major pathogen in swine dysentery, B. pilosicoli and B. intermedia cause milder colitis, whereas B. murdochii and B. innocens are not pathogenic. For the identification of the species of the genus Brachyspira, several PCR-based assays were proposed, as well as a test involving the amplification of a highly variable region of the Brachyspira NADH Oxidase (nox) gene with PCR and then sequencing this PCR product for species identification. The results of these tests suggest that a potentially virulent new species of Brachyspira has been discovered, circulating among swine herds in North America. In relation to proliferative enteropathy, also a disease of the finishers, new laboratory diagnostic tests were presented and evaluated. Fecal PCR analysis, however, was not sufficiently sensitive for the diagnosis of all infections. Serological diagnostic methods were mentioned and evaluated, particularly for monitoring subclinically affected herds. Necropsy followed by the specific identification of L. intracellulars in the lessons by immunohistochemistry is the gold standard for a definitive diagnosis of proliferative enteropathy. According to the papers on porcine astrovirus (PoAstV) and Torque teno sus virus (TTsUV), these viruses have a high prevalence in fecal samples from pigs with clinical diarrhea. Further research is necessary, however, for any definite conclusions on their role in causing diarrhea in pigs.

AB  - Objective While unexplained liver dysfunction is common, it is sometimes difficult to identify its exact cause. One cause is viral infections. The identification of viruses other than hepatitis B and C that cause liver dysfunction is difficult because no methods to simultaneously identify these viruses have been established. The aim of this study was to quickly and simultaneously identify multiple virus species. Methods A total of 49 patients with unexplained liver dysfunction and undetermined inflammation were examined. The majority of patients had hematologic malignancies, and some had undergone bone marrow transplantation. Qualitative polymerase chain reactions (PCR) were performed to detect 12 species of DNA virus in whole blood. Quantitative real-time PCR was performed when a specific virus was amplified. In addition, 6 RNA hepatitis viruses were directly assayed by real-time PCR. These 2 PCR steps were completed within 1 hour. Results The most frequently detected virus in 37 patients with liver dysfunction, was transfusion transmitted virus (38%), which was followed by human herpes virus (HHV) type 6 (35%), Epstein-Barr virus (14%), cytomegalovirus (8%), and rarely hepatitis G virus and HHV-7 (3%). Similar viremia was observed in 12 patients with mild liver dysfunction. The results of the PCR assay were mostly consistent with those of routine virus serological tests. Conclusion A multiplex viral PCR assay was a useful tool for quickly identifying viruses that possibly cause liver dysfunction. It was also important that liver dysfunction acted as a proband that led to the discovery of serious viremia. © 2013 The Japanese Society of Internal Medicine.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are recently discovered DNA viruses, with heterogeneous genomes, highly prevalent in populations worldwide. The species that infect humans are Torque teno virus (TTV), Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) and Torque teno mini virus (TTMV). High-resolution melting analysis (HRMA) is a sensitive and effective method for genotyping and mutation scanning. Up to now, HRMA has not been utilized for detection of TTVs. The aim of this study was to asses if HRMA is suitable for detecting TTVs variants. DNA was extracted from the blood and saliva of 13 healthy subjects for method optimization. Additionally, saliva samples from 100 healthy individuals were collected for estimating the TTVs' prevalence. Viral DNA was amplified by heminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Second round amplicons were used for the HRMA. The samples were analyzed using two fluorescent dyes, SYBR® Green I and EvaGreen®. The prevalence values for TTV, TTMDV and TTMV were 71.0, 31.0 and 54.0%, respectively. The three major melting curve patterns corresponding to TTV, TTMDV and TTMV on HRMA can be easily distinguished regardless of kit used. Our results showed that HRMA is a rapid and efficient method of detecting human TTVs.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) was surveyed in tap water collected in schools from three municipalities located in the south of Brazil. TTV genomes were found in 11. 7 % (4/34) of the samples. TTV DNA was detected in 10. 5 % (2/19) of the samples collected at the city of Caxias do Sul and in 25 % (2/8) of the samples from Pelotas. Those cities have a low rate of sewage treatment. All samples from Santa Cruz do Sul, which has nearly 92 % of its sewage treated, were negative. These results suggest that the amount of sewage treated may have an effect on the detection rates of TTV DNA in drinking water in a given urban area, showing a mild negative correlation (r = -0. 76), when comparing the percentage of sewage treatment to the detection of TTV genomes. The detection rate of TTV was also compared with Escherichia coli, showing a strong correlation (r = 0. 97), indicating that TTV may be a suitable marker of fecal contamination. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are a group of viruses with small, circular DNA genomes. Members of this family are thought to ubiquitously infect humans, although causal disease associations are currently lacking. At present, there is no understanding of how infection with this diverse group of viruses is so prevalent. Using a combined computational and synthetic approach, we predict and identify miRNA-coding regions in diverse human TTVs and provide evidence for TTV miRNA production in vivo. The TTV miRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, processed by Drosha and Dicer, and are active in RISC. A TTV mutant defective for miRNA production replicates as well as wild type virus genome; demonstrating that the TTV miRNA is dispensable for genome replication in a cell culture model. We demonstrate that a recombinant TTV genome is capable of expressing an exogenous miRNA, indicating the potential utility of TTV as a small RNA vector. Gene expression profiling of host cells identifies N-myc (and STAT) interactor (NMI) as a target of a TTV miRNA. NMI transcripts are directly regulated through a binding site in the 3′UTR. SiRNA knockdown of NMI contributes to a decreased response to interferon signaling. Consistent with this, we show that a TTV miRNA mediates a decreased response to IFN and increased cellular proliferation in the presence of IFN. Thus, we add Annelloviridae to the growing list of virus families that encode miRNAs, and suggest that miRNA-mediated immune evasion can contribute to the pervasiveness associated with some of these viruses. © 2013 Kincaid et al.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) is a novel virus that has been found widely distributed in the swine population in recent years. Analysis of codon usage can reveal much about the molecular evolution of TTSuV1. In this study, synonymous codon usage patterns and the key determinants in the coding region of 29 available complete TTSuV1 genome sequences were examined. By calculating the nucleotide content and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) of TTSuV1 coding sequences, we found that the preferentially used codons were mostly those ending with A or C nucleotides; less-used codons were mostly codons ending with U or G nucleotides, and these were mainly affected by composition constraints. Although there was a variation in codon usage bias among different TTSuV1 genomes, the codon usage bias and GC content in the TTSuV1 coding region was lower, which was mainly determined by the base composition in the third codon position and the effective number of codons (ENC) value. Moreover, the results of correspondence analysis (COA) indicated that the codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 isolated from different countries varied greatly and had significant differences. In addition, Spearman's rank correlation analysis and an ENC plot revealed that apart from mutation pressure, which was critical in determining the codon usage pattern, other factors were involved in shaping the evolution of codon usage bias in TTSuV1, such as natural selection. Those results suggested that synonymous codon usage patterns of TTSuV1 genomes were the result of interaction between mutation pressure and natural selection. The information from this study not only provides important insights into the synonymous codon usage pattern of TTSuV1, but also helps to identify the main factors affecting codon usage by this virus. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Swine effluents must be correctly handled to avoid negative environmental impacts. In this study, the profiles of two swine manure treatment systems were evaluated: a solid-liquid separation step, followed by an anaerobic reactor, and an aerobic step (System 1); and a biodigester followed by serial lagoons (System 2). Both systems were described by the assessment of chemical, bacterial and viral parameters. The results showed that in System 1, there was reduction of chemicals (COD, phosphorus, total Kjeldhal nitrogen - TKN - and NH3), total coliforms and Escherichia coli; however, the same reduction was not observed for Salmonella sp. Viral particles were significantly reduced but not totally eliminated from the effluent. In System 2, there was a reduction of chemicals, bacteria and viruses with no detection of Salmonella sp., circovirus, parvovirus, and torque teno virus in the effluent. The chemical results indicate that the treated effluent can be reused for cleaning swine facilities. However, the microbiological results show a need of additional treatment to achieve a complete inactivation for cases when direct contact with animals is required. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The risk of transfusion-transmitted infections has been greatly reduced by improvements in donor screening and testing. However, newly recognized blood-borne infectious agents can be threats to blood safety. In order to evaluate the prevalence some of these agents in blood donors, a systematic review was conducted. Data were obtained from published papers related to HGV, Torque Teno virus (TTV), HTLV, West Nile virus (WNV) and SEN virus (SEN-V). Based on these studies, the prevalence of HGV varied from 1 to 8.6% for anti-E2 and from 0 to 4.8% for HGV RNA. The prevalence of TTV DNA and HTLV-I varied from 2.7 to 79.5% and from 0.013 to 2.3%, respectively. The WNV-specific IgM antibody and WNV RNA are negative in blood donors. Prevalence rates of SEN-V in Iranian blood donors range from 23 to 90.8%. Consequences of these infectious agents for blood safety are different. Thus, the need to perform laboratory screening as well as effectiveness and efficiency of laboratory tests depend on pathogenicity level and epidemiological conditions of emerging infections. However, being prepared based on the current level of risk and interventions to reduce the risk can be effective in reducing the potential threat for blood supply. © 2013 S. Karger GmbH, Freiburg.

AB  - Extreme varieties of viruses exist in the environment and animals, some of which are unknown. However, many unknown viruses are barely detected by means of conventional virus isolation and PCR assay. To develop a technology platform for detecting unknown viruses. We established the technology based on viral metagenomics in combination with novel molecular diagnostics. The technology is consisted of removal of host nucleic acid, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing, and bioinformatics. The technology was applied to detect classical swine fever virus (CSFV)-infected cells and a tissue sample of a pig infected with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). We amplified 13.7% sequences of CSFV genome and 47.2% those of PCV2 genome, respectively. Moreover, we amplified 16.4% sequences of the simian parainfluenza virus type 5 genome from an unknown virus cell culture using the developed method. In addition, using the developed method combined with the high-throughput sequencing, we detected 1.1% virus sequences, including CSFV, PCV2, torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and human adenovirus type 6 (Ad6) from 7 clinical swine samples of unknown causative agents. The developed metagenomics-based method showed good sensitivity for detection of both DNA and RNA viruses from diverse swine samples, and has potential for universal detection of known and unknown viruses. It might facilitate the diagnosis of emerging viral diseases.

AB  - Aim: To develop a suitable proliferative cell culture system for chronic gastritis-related tiny virus, and to identify the type of this virus. Methods: The gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC-7901 was used to culture the tiny virus, and cells were observed by inverted microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The primers for transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) and human parvovirus B19 were used to amplify DNA from the tiny virus. Results: After three blind passages in SGC-7901 cells, the tiny virus could proliferate in vitro and produce obvious CPE. TEM analysis showed that TTV was distributed in the nucleus and cytoplasm. The virions were globular, approximately 20 nm in size. PCR analysis showed that the tiny virus specimens were TTV DNA amplification-positive. Conclusion: SGC-7901 cells can be used as a proliferation system for tiny virus. The tiny virus and TTV virus belong to the same genus. © 2013 Baishideng. All rights reserved.

AB  - SEN virus (SENV), is a recently discovered single-stranded DNA virus of Annelloviridae family and is believed may play a role in non A-E hepatitis. We conducted this study to identify the prevalence and clinical association of SENV with acute and chronic hepatitis. 135 liver disease patients were studied. Extent of liver damage was assessed using the Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score. A-E viruses and HIV were detected by enzyme immunoassay. Nested PCR was performed for detection of SENV and its genotypes D and H. 34 cases (25.18%) were positive for SEN virus DNA, a statistically significant finding (p < 0.01) of which 22 (64%) had acute viral hepatitis, 4 (11.76%) had chronic viral hepatitis, 3 (8.82%) fulminant hepatic failure and 5 (14.70%) cirrhosis. Mean AST was 47.85 IU/L, ALT 51.2 IU/L and INR 1.73, mean MELD score was 18.38 (11 to 24). 17.64% had severely deranged MELD score. SENV-D genotype was detected in 13 (38%) and SENV-H in 19 (58%) cases. SENV-H occurred in both acute (53%) and chronic hepatitis (47%). SENV-D was strongly associated with acute hepatitis (85%). Cirrhotic and FHF cases were SENV-H positive. 12 (44.11%) were co-infected with HBV, 5 (14.7%) with TTV, 4(11.76%) with HEV, 2 (5.88%) with HCV and 5 (14.4%) with HIV. Significant prevalence of SENV in hepatitis patients was observed. On the basis of clinical findings and abnormal liver function tests, we conclude that SENV appears to be not only hepatotropic but also capable of liver damage. Higher prevalence of SENV-H in cirrhotics may point to its possible role in the development of cirrhosis.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence of Hepatitis-B, Hepatitis-C and Human Immunodeficiency infections in replacement blood donors. Materials and Methods: From January 2004 to December 2011, 108,598 apparently healthy donors donated blood at our Blood Bank. Screening was done by Microparticle Enzyme Immuno Assay (MEIA) method on Axsym System (Abbott Diagnostic, USA) and in year 2011 by Chemiluminescent Immunoassay (CIA) method on Architect i2000 (Abbott Diagnostic, USA). From 2010 onward, HIV reactive donors were advised for confirmatory tests and reported back with the results. Results: Of the 108,598 total donors, 108,393 (99.8%) were replacement donors with a mean age of 28.92 (17-55) years. Of this, only 164 (0.15%) were females. Among the replacement donors, 4,906 (4.5%) were found to be reactive for Hepatitis-B, C and Human Immunodeficiency Virus. All the reactive patients, except one, were males. HbsAg was positive in 2,068 (1.90%) and anti-HCV in 2832 (2.61%) donors, while 111 (0.10%) were positive for Human Immunodeficiency Virus. Co-infectivity was observed in 103 (0.09%) cases. The prevalence appeared to be higher in younger age group (17-30 yrs). Only 16.6% cases should be patients returned with results of the confirmatory tests for HIV and were found positive. Conclusion: Hepatitis-B and C sero-prevalence in our series of replacement donors appears high compared to most studies from neighboring countries and relatively low in comparison to earlier studies from Pakistan. Prevalence of HIV, however, appears low and turn out of HIV positive cases for confirmatory tests is low.

AB  - The Thalassemia center of Antalya State Hospital was established in 1994 in Antalya, Turkey. The number of newborns with thalassemia decreased statistically because of actions taken as a result of prevention studies. A total of 388 patients, including 246 with thalassemia major (63.4%), 86 with thalassemia intermediate (22.1%), 23 with sickle cell+β-thalassemia (5.9%), 20 with sickle cell disease (5.1%), and 13 with other hemoglobin abnormalities (3.3%), were studied. Complications were found to be as follows: cardiomyopathy in 45 of them (11.5%), diabetes mellitus in 10 (2.5%), hypothyroidism in 17 (4.3%), hypoparathyroidism in 2 (0.5%), osteoporosis in 53 (13.6%), growth retardation in 110 (28.3%), and hypogonadism in 75 patients (19.3%). The incidence of autoantibody and alloantibody in patients with thalassemia major was 5.6% and 10.5%, respectively. Transfusion-transmission diseases evaluated in patients found the incidence of hepatit A virus IgG to be 97.5%, that of HBs Ab to be 99.5%, HBs Ag to be 0.5%, HCV Ab to be 18%, CMV IgG to be 72.3%, CMV IgM to be 2%, and HIV-Ab to be 0%. Therefore, for the first time in our country the thalassemia center was established as a model and included subunits and a team. It served all patients for 15 years until the team was dispersed; thereafter, most of the patients were not followed up on a regular basis. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Introduction. The pathogenicity and transmission routes of Transfusion Transmitted Virus (TTV) remain unclear. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TTV in hemodialysis patients, injecting drug users (IDUs), and healthy blood donors, in Isfahan, Iran. Method. In a case-control study, a total of 108 subjects were put into three groups namely Group I, 36 hemodialysis patients; Group II, 36 IDUs; and Group III, 36 healthy blood donors as the control group. A 5 ml blood sample was collected from each subject in an EDTA-containing tube. Samples were tested for TTV DNA by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results. The mean age was 38.7 ± 14.7 years. Seventy-one subjects (66%) were male. Of the108 cases, 30 (27.8%) were TTV positive and 78 (72.2%) were TTV negative. The prevalence of TTV in IDUs [21 (58%)] was significantly higher than in the other groups [group I: 6 (17 %) and group III: 3 (8%)] (P < 0.0001). Conclusion. The prevalence of TTV in IDUs is significantly higher than in both hemodialysis patients and general population in Isfahan, Iran. It seems necessary to take serious measures to reduce the risk of TTV transmission to IDUs' close contacts and health care providers. © 2012 Behrooz Ataei et al.

AB  - Kawasaki disease (KD) is the most common cause of multisystem vasculitis in childhood. Although cervical lymphadenitis is one of the major symptoms in KD, lymph node biopsy is rarely performed, because KD is usually diagnosed by clinical symptoms. A cervical lymph node biopsy was taken from a girl aged 1 year and 8 months who had suspected lymphoma, but she was diagnosed with KD after the biopsy. The cervical lymph node specimen was analyzed with multivirus real-time PCR that can detect >160 viruses, and unbiased direct sequencing with a next-generation DNA sequencer to detect potential pathogens in the lymph node. Histologically, focal necrosis with inflammatory cell infiltration, including neutrophils and macrophages, was observed in the marginal zone of the cervical lymph node, which was compatible with the acute phase of KD. Multivirus real-time PCR detected a low copy number of torque teno virus in the sample. Comprehensive direct sequencing of the cervical lymph node biopsy sample sequenced more than 8 million and 3 million reads from DNA and RNA samples, respectively. Bacterial genomes were detected in 0.03% and 1.79% of all reads in DNA and RNA samples, respectively. Although many reads corresponded to genomes of bacterial environmental microorganisms, Streptococcus spp. genome was detected in both DNA (77 reads) and RNA (2,925 reads) samples. Further studies are required to reveal any association of microbial or viral infection with the pathogenesis of KD.

AB  - The study describes a novel Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species, provisionally named Torque teno sus virus k2b (TTSuVk2b), originally found in commercial pig sera by applying the rollingcircle amplification technique. Full-length sequences of TTSuVk2b were obtained, annotated and used in the phylogenetic analyses, which revealed that TTSuVk2b is a novel Anellovirus species within the genus Kappatorquevirus of the family Anelloviridae. Quantitative PCR techniques were developed to determine total TTSuV DNA quantities as well as the prevalence and viral DNA quantities of TTSuV1, TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b. The mean total TTSuV load in seven commercial sera was determined at 6.3 log10 DNA copies ml-1 of serum, with TTSuVk2b loads being the lowest at 4.5 log10 DNA copies ml-1 of serum. Subsequently, prevalence and loads of TTSuVs were determined in pig sera from 17 countries. TTSuVk2b prevalence ranged from 0 to 100% with viral loads from 3.3 to 4.6 log10 copies ml-1 of sera. TTSuVk2a, so far the only species in the genus Kappatorquevirus, has been linked to an economically important swine disease, namely post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Considering the grouping of TTSuVk2b in the same genus as TTSuVk2a, TTSuVk2b prevalence and viral DNA load were determined in PMWS-affected animals and healthy counterparts. This revealed that TTSuVk2a and TTSuVk2b are not only genetically related, but also that their viral loads in serum are elevated in PMWS animals compared with those of healthy pen mates. In summary, the present work describes a novel TTSuV species including its genetic characterization, epidemiological assessment and potential disease association. © 2012 Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - Background: Torque Teno Virus (TTV) was the first single stranded circular DNA virus to be discovered that infects humans. Although there have been numerous reports regarding the prevalence of TTV from other countries of South Asia, there is severe lack of information regarding its prevalence in Pakistan. Thus the present study compiles the first indigenous report to comprehensively illustrate the incidence of the virus in uninfected and hepatitis infected population from Pakistan. Another aim of the study was to present the sequence of full length TTV genome from a local isolate and compare it with the already reported genome sequences from other parts of the world. Methods. TTV DNA was screened in the serum of 116, 100 and 40 HBV infected, HCV infected and uninfected individuals respectively. Nearly full length genome of TTV was cloned from a HBV patient. The genome sequence was subjected to in-silico analysis using CLC Workbench, ClustalW, ClustalX and TreeView. Statistical analysis was carried out in SPSS v17.0. Results: Our results report that 89.7%, 90.0% and 92.5% of HBV, HCV patients and healthy control population were positive for TTV infection. TTV genome of 3603 bp was also cloned from a local isolate and given the identity of TPK01. The TTV genome sequence mentioned in this paper is submitted in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under the accession number JN980171. Phylogenetic analysis of TPK01 revealed that the Pakistani isolate has sequence similarities with genotype 23 and 22 (Genogroup 2). Conclusion: The results of the current study indicate that the high frequency of TTV viremia in Pakistan conforms to the reports from other areas of the world, wherever screening of TTV DNA was performed against 5§ssup§′§esup§-UTR of the genome. The high sequence diversity among TTV genome sequences and the high frequency of prevalence makes it harder to study this virus in cellular systems. © 2012 Hussain et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - We detected Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) in tissue samples from 18 stillborn piglets using nested polymerase chain reaction. The detection rates of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were 78% and 50%, respectively, with 83% of the stillborn piglets positive for TTSuV1 or TTSuV2. TTSuV1 was detected highest in the liver (72%) followed by heart (56%), spleen (38%) and tonsils (38%) while TTSuV2 was detected highest in the tonsils (38%) followed by liver (33%), spleen (25%), and heart (17%). These results indicate that TTSuVs are commonly present but not equally distributed among the tissues of stillborn piglets. © 2012 The Korean Society of Veterinary Science.

AB  - To determine whether exhaled breath contains Torque teno virus (TTV) or not, we tested exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples by semi-nested PCR assay. We detected TTV DNA in 35 (7/20) of EBC samples collected from the mouth of one of the authors, demonstrating that TTV DNA is excreted in exhaled breath with moderate frequency. TTV DNA was detected also in oral EBC samples from 4 of 6 other authors, indicating that TTV DNA excretion in exhaled breath is not an exception but rather a common phenomenon. Furthermore, the same assay could amplify TTV DNA from room air condensate (RAC) samples collected at distances of 20 and 40cm from a human face with 40 (8/20) and 35 (7/20) positive rates, respectively. TTV transmission has been reported to occur during infancy. These distances seem equivalent to that between an infant and its household members while caring for the infant. Taken together, it seems that exhaled breath is one of the possible transmission routes of TTV. We also detected TTV DNA in 25 (10/40) of RAC samples collected at a distance of more than 180cm from any human face, suggesting the risk of airborne infection with TTV in a room. © 2012 by Okayama University Medical School.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is responsible for the infection of pig herds around the world. The aim of this study was to analyse the presence of natural infection by both species of TTSuV in suckling piglets from major pig-producing regions of Brazil. Faecal samples (n = 135) from 1 to 3-week-old suckling piglets from the Southern, Southeast and Midwest regions of Brazil were analysed by PCR assay to detect TTSuV1 and 2. TTSuV1 and 2 DNA was identified in 65 (48.1 %) and 23 (17 %) of piglet faecal samples, respectively. Co-infection by both species of TTSuV was detected in 17 (12.6 %) samples. Detection of TTSuV1 was significantly higher than that of TTSuV2 in the three Brazilian regions together (p < 0.05). Based on age of animals, TTSuV1 infection was statistically higher than TTSuV2 in each age group (p < 0.05). For all of the age groups together, no statistical difference was detected in the number of TTSuV1 and 2 positive results (p > 0.05). These findings revealed that TTSuV infection has disseminated in pig herds from different geographic Brazilian regions, and the presence of TTSuV in suckling piglet faecal samples suggested the early infection by the virus and the potential of these animals in spreading the virus. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - According to the published genomic sequence of TTSuVl (GenBank Accession No. AB07 6001.1), the pairs of specific PCR/nested-PCR primers were designed to amplify the full length of TTSuVl complete genome from blood serum samples in Sichuan province. The amplified fragments were cloned, sequenced and named as TTSuVl-SCI and TTSuVl-SC2, respectively. The sequencing results showed that the complete genome of them were 2852 bp and 2917 bp in length. And then, the correct target sequences gained were deposited in GenBank and the GenBank accession number JF694116 and JF694117 were generated. Homology analysis of TTSuVl-SCI, TTSuVl-SC2 and reference strain sequences retrieved in GenBank indicated that the complete genome of TTSuVl-SCl and TTSuVl-SC2 from Sichuan isolated strains shared 81-98 and 82-99% homology, respectively with those reference sequences. The phylogenetic tree analysis indicated that the closest genetic relationship of TTSuVl-SCl and TTSuVl-SC2 isolated strains were TTVlBjlO strain HM633251.1 and TTVSH0822/2008 strain (GU450331.1). The study would lay a biological foundation to understand the epidemiology, genetic variation of the virus. © Medwell Journals, 2012.

AB  - HCV infection is known to be associated with clinical complications in thalassemic patients. D and H genotypes of SEN virus (SENV) are associated with blood-product transfusion and possibly non-A-to-E hepatitis. In this study, SENV viremia and its effect on liver ALT level in thalassemic patients, thalassemic patients infected with HCV, and HCV-infected patients were examined. Semi-nested PCR was conducted for detection of genotype H and D DNA, and the level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) was measured. There was no significant difference in the mean ALT level in the studied groups and between SENV-positive and SENV-negative individuals. The results also showed that SENV infection does not affect the ALT level in these patients. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: Safe blood supply is the main goal of blood transfusion services. Nucleic Acid Amplification Technologies (NAT) are the methods for direct detection of viral genoms in various biological samples. Introduction of NAT blood screening reduces the risk for transfusion transmitted diseases and improves the safety. Methods and Results: In Slovenia NAT screening with PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) method for testing pools of samples for hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA was implemented in 2000. The screening is mandatory for all donations. Until 2007, 590,000 donated units had been screened and there were no HCV RNA-only positive result. In 2007, the testing was expanded to three viruses: HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The testing method was TMA (Transcription Mediated Amplification) performed on individual donations. In five-year period, 458,000 blood units were screened and two window-period donations positive for HCV were detected (yield 1:524,000). HBV DNA-only was detected in 29 units. All the cases were donors with a resolved HBV infection, in one case the recent one, in others the occult hepatitis B infection (OBI) was confirmed. The yield of NAT testing for HBV is 1:15,600 units. There were no donations with HIV 1 RNA-only result. In all 5 HIV positive units in this period, anti-HIV antibodies were present as well. The yield of HIV NAT-only is thus 0:460,000. Conclusion: The implementation of NAT screening for three viruses has improved the blood safety. In the five-year period, 31 infectious units that were NAT-only positive were eliminated from the stock.

AB  - The Anelloviridae family consists of non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA viruses. Three genera of anellovirus are known to infect humans, named TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV. Although anelloviruses were initially thought to cause non-A-G viral hepatitis, continued research has shown no definitive associations between anellovirus and human disease to date. Using high-throughput sequencing, we investigated the association between anelloviruses and fever in pediatric patients 2-36 months of age. We determined that although anelloviruses were present in a large number of specimens from both febrile and afebrile patients, they were more prevalent in the plasma and nasopharyngeal (NP) specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. Using PCR to detect each of the three species of anellovirus that infect humans, we found that anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV were more prevalent in the plasma and NP specimens of febrile patients compared to afebrile controls. This was not the case for species TTMV which was found in similar percentages of febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Analysis of patient age showed that the percentage of plasma and NP specimens containing anellovirus increased with age until patients were 19-24 months of age, after which the percentage of anellovirus positive patient specimens dropped. This trend was striking for TTV and TTMDV and very modest for TTMV in both plasma and NP specimens. Finally, as the temperature of febrile patients increased, so too did the frequency of TTV and TTMDV detection. Again, TTMV was equally present in both febrile and afebrile patient specimens. Taken together these data indicate that the human anellovirus species TTV and TTMDV are associated with fever in children, while the highly related human anellovirus TTMV has no association with fever. © 2012 McElvania TeKippe et al.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is ubiquitous and species-specific, and two different TTV species, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2), have been described in domestic pigs and wild boars. Whether these two species are involved in clinical cases of porcine circovirus type 2-associated disease (PCVDs) remains unknown. This study investigates the presence of TTSuV in 85 fetuses, pigs and wild boars infected by PCV2 and affected by PCVDs other than postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome. It also explores the genetic diversity of identified strains using phylogenetic analysis. The presence or absence of TTSuV was determined in 85 samples of PCV2-containing organs from 85 infected animals using a specific, one-step PCR method. A nucleotide distance matrix between sequences was computed to infer phylogeny based on a median-joining (MJ) network. TTSuV2 showed high prevalence in animals affected by nephropathy and proliferative and necrotising pneumonia (PNP), and both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 showed high prevalence in wild boars affected by PMWS. TTSuV1 showed low prevalence in animals affected by nephropathy and PNP, and both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 showed low prevalence in animals with reproductive disorders. MJ network analysis revealed significant genetic diversity among Croatian isolates.

AB  - In order to verify the microbial quality of the influents and effluents of one STP from southern Brazil, an eight-month survey was conducted to examine the presence of total and fecal coliforms and of adenovirus (HAdV), enterovirus (EV), genogroup A rotaviruses (GARV) and Torque teno virus (TTV), in treated effluent samples from São João/ Navegantes STP, Porto Alegre (Brazil). A total of 16 samples were collected, eight of influent (raw sewage, prior to treatment), and the other eight of the effluent (post-treatment sewage). Total and fecal coliform levels ranging from 3.6 × 104 to 4.4 × 107 MPN/100 mL and 2.9 × 103 to 1.7 × 107 MPN/100 mL, were detected in all samples. In raw sewage, HAdV (25%) and GARV (28.6%) viral genomes were detected. The analysis of effluent samples revealed the presence of HAdV (50%), EV (37.5%), and TTV (12.5%) genomic fragments. All samples, regardless of the month analysed, presented detection of a least one virus genus, except for in April. Higher virus detection rates were observed in treated sewage samples (62.5%), and in 80% of them (effluent positive samples) HAdV was detected. Results showed that improvements in sewage monitoring and treatment processes are necessary to reduce the viral and bacterial load on the environment in southern Brazil. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first study showing the monitoring of viral genomes in influent and effluent samples from a STP located in Porto Alegre (Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil), southern Brazil.

Serum DNA of 112 mothers to leukemic children was amplified using whole genome amplification. Sequencing identified one TT virus (TTV) isolate belonging to a known type and two putatively new TTVs. For 22 mothers, we also performed TTV amplification by general primer PCR before sequencing. This detected 39 TTVs, two of which were identical to the TTVs found after whole genome amplification.Altogether, we found 40 TTV isolates, 29 of which were putatively new types (similarities ranging from 89% to 69%). In conclusion, high throughput sequencing is useful to describe the known or unknown viruses that are present in serum samples of pregnant women. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae includes human and animal torque teno viruses (TTVs) with extensive genetic diversity. The antigenic diversity among anelloviruses has never been assessed. Using torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) as a model, we describe here the first investigation of the antigenic relationships among different anelloviruses. Using a TTSuV genotype 1a (TTSuV1a) or TTSuV1b enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on the respective putative ORF1 capsid antigen and TTSuV1-specific real-time PCR, the combined serological and virological profile of TTSuV1 infection in pigs was determined and compared with that of TTSuV2. TTSuV1 is likely not associated with porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), because both the viral loads and antibody levels were not different between affected and unaffected pigs and because there was no synergistic effect of concurrent PCV2/TTSuV1 infections. We did observe a higher correlation of IgG antibody levels between anti-TTSuV1a and -TTSuV1b than between anti-TTSuV1a or -1b and anti-TTSuV2 antibodies in these sera, implying potential antigenic crossreactivity. To confirm this, rabbit antisera against the putative capsid proteins of TTSuV1a, TTSuV1b, or TTSuV2 were generated, and the antigenic relationships among these TTSuVs were analyzed by an ELISA and by an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using PK-15 cells transfected with one of the three TTSuV ORF1 constructs. The results demonstrate antigenic crossreactivity between the two genotypes TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b but not between the two species TTSuV1a or -1b and TTSuV2. Furthermore, an anti-genogroup 1 human TTV antiserum did not react with any of the three TTSuV antigens. These results have important implications for an understanding of the diversity of anelloviruses as well as for the classification and vaccine development of TTSuVs. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Background: SEN virus (SEN-V) and TT virus (TTV) have been classified in the circoviridae family. Both are single-stranded, non-enveloped DNA viruses of about 3800 nucleotides. Patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) have a high risk of blood-borne viral infections. SEN-V and TTV has been reported from a number of HD units from various countries throughout the world. Materials and Methods: A total of 377 blood samples obtained from 150 healthy donors and 227 HD patients were collected at the HD center. SEN-V and TTV DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in all samples. Results: TTV was detected in 109 (48.01%) of 227 hemodialysed patients and 14 (9.33%) of 150 voluntary blood donors (significant, P < 0.05). The PCR results for SEN-V-D/H DNA showed that 65 (28.63%) were positive for SEN-V-D and 33 (14.53%) were positive for SEN-V-H. 9.69% of 227 patients were positive for SEN-V-D/H co-infection. In the control group, SEN-V-D was detected in 14 (9.33%) and SEN-V-H was detected in 15 (10%) of the 150 (100%) blood donors. Conclusion: These findings show that the prevalence of SEN-V-D/H and TTV is higher than healthy blood donors. Also, these results indicate that the prevalence of SEN-V and TTV infections in our region is similar with that in other countries.

AB  - Background: The rising demand for pork has resulted in a massive expansion of pig production in Uganda. This has resulted in increased contact between humans and pigs. Pigs can act as reservoirs for emerging infectious diseases. Therefore identification of potential zoonotic pathogens is important for public health surveillance. In this study, during a routine general surveillance for African swine fever, domestic pigs from Uganda were screened for the presence of RNA and DNA viruses using a high-throughput pyrosequencing method. Findings. Serum samples from 16 domestic pigs were collected from five regions in Uganda and pooled accordingly. Genomic DNA and RNA were extracted and sequenced on the 454 GS-FLX platform. Among the sequences assigned to a taxon, 53% mapped to the domestic pig (Sus scrofa). African swine fever virus, Torque teno viruses (TTVs), and porcine endogenous retroviruses were identified. Interestingly, two pools (B and C) of RNA origin had sequences that showed 98% sequence identity to Ndumu virus (NDUV). None of the reads had identity to the class Insecta indicating that these sequences were unlikely to result from contamination with mosquito nucleic acids. Conclusions: This is the first report of the domestic pig as a vertebrate host for Ndumu virus. NDUV had been previously isolated only from culicine mosquitoes. NDUV therefore represents a potential zoonotic pathogen, particularly given the increasing risk of human-livestock-mosquito contact. © 2012 Masembe et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Background: As a result of rapidly growing human populations, intensification of livestock production and increasing exploitation of wildlife habitats for animal agriculture, the interface between wildlife, livestock and humans is expanding, with potential impacts on both domestic animal and human health. Wild animals serve as reservoirs for many viruses, which may occasionally result in novel infections of domestic animals and/or the human population. Given this background, we used metagenomics to investigate the presence of viral pathogens in sera collected from bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), a nocturnal species of wild Suid known to move between national parks and farmland, in Uganda. Results: Application of 454 pyrosequencing demonstrated the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine parvovirus 4 (PPV4), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV), a GB Hepatitis C-like virus, and a Sclerotinia hypovirulence-associated-like virus in sera from the bushpigs. PCR assays for each specific virus combined with Sanger sequencing revealed two TTSuV-1 variants, one TTSuV-2 variant as well as PPV4 in the serum samples and thereby confirming the findings from the 454 sequencing. Conclusions: Using a viral metagenomic approach we have made an initial analysis of viruses present in bushpig sera and demonstrated for the first time the presence of PPV4 in a wild African Suid. In addition we identified novel variants of TTSuV-1 and 2 in bushpigs. © 2012 Blomström et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Capsicum annuum cv. 'Serrano' is tolerant to both salinity and the root-knot nematode (Meloidogyne incognita). Most salt-tolerant cultivars are not resistant to nematodes, vice versa. A study was conducted to determine how M. incognita race 2 and salinity would affect growth of cv. 'Serrano' at different time intervals. Treatments were arranged in a split-plot design with the main factor being nematode, sub-plot being salinity and sub-sub-plot harvest time. At harvest, second-order interactions for all variables were not significant (P ≤ 0.05), while nematode × time interaction contributed 9%, 23%, 22%, 13%, 14% and 16% to the total treatment variation (TTV) in fresh fruit mass, dry shoot mass, dry root mass, stem diameter, plant height and chlorophyll content, respectively. Salt × time interaction contributed to TTV in dry root mass, stem diameter and plant height by 4%, 8% and 5%, respectively. Results suggested that the interactions were additive, multiplicative and/or synergistic on various variables. In conclusion, both nematode and salinity must be managed overtime for successful growth and productivity of cv. 'Serrano'. © 2012 Friends Science Publishers.

AB  - This study evaluated histological lesions in kidney samples from pigs with nephritis in two slaughterhouses in the State of Mato Grosso, Brazil. Four hundred samples were subjected to histology, anti-porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) immunohistochemistry (IHC), anti-Leptospira sp. immunofluorescence (IF), and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for PCV2, porcine parvovirus (PPV), and Torque teno virus type 1 and 2 (TTV1, TTV2) detection. Histological lesions were found in 81% of the samples, and mononuclear interstitial nephritis was the most frequent lesion (77.50%). A follicular pattern was observed in 40.97% of the interstitial nephritis lesions. PCV2, PPV, TTV1, and TTV2 were identified in the kidneys by PCR in 27.25%, 28.50%, 94%, and 87.5% of the samples, respectively. Leptospira sp. was not detected through IF. Infection by PCV2 (PCR) and the presence of histological lesions (P=0.008) and giant cells (P=0.0016) were significantly associated. An association was observed between the TTV2-TTV1 co-infection (P<0.0001) and the risk for pathogenesis. These findings indicated that PCV2, PPV, TTV1, and TTV2 were widely distributed among pigs in the local farms and that the presence of these agents should be considered in the differential diagnosis of kidneys with interstitial nephritis in pigs.

AB  - This study investigates the frequency of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection in 150 blood donors and 77 patients requiring haemodialysis in southern Brazil. Plasma samples were screened for TTV DNA using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The prevalences of TTV among blood donors and patients requiring haemodialysis were 73.3% and 68.8%, respectively. The presence of TTV was correlated with age in the blood donors (p = 0.024). In haemodialysis patients, no association was found between TTV infection and the demographic parameters (age, sex and education), the duration of haemodialysis or a history of blood transfusion. This study is the first to evaluate the prevalence of TTV infection in Brazilian patients requiring haemodialysis.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV) was the first human Circoviridae detected in a Japanese patient with unknown hepatitis in 1997. Subsequently, several studies performed to evaluate different aspects of Torque teno virus pathogenesis. Objectives: The present study aimed to determine dominant genotype of Torque teno virus in chronic hepatitis disease using 5'-UTR sequence among patients infected by hepatitis C virus in Shiraz - Iran. Patients and Methods: The study conducted in 240 patients with chronic hepatitis C from Prof. Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center. The presence of Torque teno virus DNA and its genotype in plasma was assessed by nested polymerase chain reaction using two primer sets for 5'-UTR and N22 regions. Phylogenetic analysis was performed based on 5'-UTR region. Results: DNA of Torque teno virus was detected in 220 out of 240 (92 %) patients with chronic hepatitis C by the use of 5'-UTR primer based PCR method and in 12 out of 240 (5 %) by the use of N22 primer. Based on phylogenetic analysis it was shown that the Dominant genotype in this study was 11. Genotypes 1, 3, 17, and 22 were also detected. Some sequences could not be classified to a specific genotype. Conclusions: The prevalence of Torque teno virus DNA in patients with chronic hepatitis C disease by the use of 5'-UTR primer appeared to be higher compared to that revealed by N22 primer. We observed five genotypes among hepatitis C chronic patients in our study. © 2012 Kowsar Corp.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is emergent in swine herds. Recent studies have shown an increased frequency of TTSuV2 in Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-associated diseases (PCVAD), which are endemic in many swine-producing countries, including Brazil. Coinfection with several other viral and bacterial agents results in an increased incidence of more severe PCVAD. Given the limited information on TTSuV and PCV2 coinfection, especially in Brazilian swine herds, this study made a preliminary estimation of the occurrence of coinfection in swine herds by testing samples from different categories. Between 2008 and 2009, 111 samples of feces and 23 serum samples from 5 swine herds were tested for PCV2 and TTSuVs and the results analyzed for associations between these agents. No significant differences in coinfection frequency were observed for PCV2 + TTSuV1 or for PCV2 + TTSuV2 between nursery piglets (P = 0.730), growing pigs (P = 0.331), or sows (P = 0.472). However, a significant difference was observed for PCV2 + TTSuV1 + TTSuV2 between nursery piglets and growing pigs (P = 0.004; Fisher's exact test). Phylogenetic studies agreed with the grouping of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 into 2 different clades, with no distinct pattern of clustering of these isolates with the animal categories.

AB  - Infection with the Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is believed to be common yet limited information is available on the epidemiology of TTSuV. The objectives of this study were to develop novel and improve existing diagnostic methods for TTSuV infection and to investigate the prevalence of TTSuV species 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) in the USA. Three hundred and four blood or fetal thoracic fluid samples were collected from pigs on 40 US farms in 12 States. Samples were collected from fetuses and in pre-suckle neonates (n=. 73), suckling pigs (1-20 days of age; n=. 27), nursery pigs (21-55 days of age; n=. 60), finisher pigs (8-25 weeks of age; n=. 90) and adults (>25 weeks of age; n=. 54). Samples were tested by a new quantitative differential real-time PCR for TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 DNA and by ELISA for detection of anti-TTSuV2-antibodies. The prevalence of TTSuV1 DNA ranged from 8.2% (fetuses and neonates) to 81% (finisher pigs) and the prevalence of TTSuV2 DNA ranged from 3.7% (suckling pigs) to 67% (finisher pigs). Evidence of fetal TTSuV infection was minimal. Mixed infection of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 was seen in 6.7% of the nursery pigs, 52.2% of the finisher pigs, and 22.2% of the mature pigs. The prevalence of TTSuV1 was higher than that of TTSuV2. Anti-TTSuV2 antibodies were not detected in the fetuses and neonates and the seroprevalence of TTSuV2 was between 3.8% and 100% in growing pigs. The results of this study indicate that vertical transmission may not be a main route of TTSuV transmission in pigs in the USA. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - A 10-year-old Japanese boy developed acute hepatitis with high levels of serum Torque teno virus DNA and marked lymphocytopenia, especially CD4 T-lymphocytopenia. Although the total lymphocyte counts rose as the patient recovered from hepatitis, this was largely because of a marked rise in CD8 cells. In contrast, CD4 cells recovered poorly, resulting in a further striking fall in the CD4/8 ratio. Two months later, the patient developed hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. He was successfully treated with immunosuppressive therapy, which normalized the lymphocyte subset proportions. T-cell subsets analysis at the onset of hepatitis might be useful for predicting development of hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia. Copyright © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - This study was carried out to investigate the presence of Torque teno sus virus types 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) in a longitudinally (14 to 150 days of age) collected paired pooled sera (pSE) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pPBMCs) using nested polymerase chain reaction. The detection rate of TTSuV1 in pSE increased from 14 to 90 days of age, but a progressive decline was observed from 120 to 150 days of age, while in pPBMC, a high value was maintained till the end of growing-finishing period. On the contrary, except in PBMCs at 30 days of age, high detection rates of TTSuV2 were found in both pSE and pPBMCs in all sampling ages. The detection rate of TTSuVs between pSE and pPBMCs was positively correlated at all sampling ages except for TTSuV1 at 150 days of age. This is the first study showing the presence of TTSuVs in PBMCs from pigs and describing the in vivo infection dynamics of TTSuV in paired sera and PBMCs during the entire growing and finishing periods of pigs reared in conventional farms. ©2012 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

AB  - This work aimed to detect and study natural co-infection of Circoviridae torque teno virus (TTV) and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) in the swine reproductive apparatus. Semen and organs from 17 boars were tested by nested and real-time PCR. PCV2 was amplified from semen (47%), lymph nodes (84.6%) and testicles (35.3%). TTV2 was amplified from 16/17 testis and 13/13 lymph nodes. TTV1 DNA was detected in fewer testicle samples (2/17), which were also TTV2 positive. Analyzed ovaries, follicular fluid and uteri of 83 culled sows showed TTV2, TTV1 and PCV2 from 49.3%, 30.1% and 6.0% of the sows, respectively. Sperm analysis indicated insignificant differences between PCV2 and TTVs positive and negative boars. The most frequent pathologic lesion in sows was endometritis (28.9%), but this was unassociated with PCV2 or TTVs detection. These findings question the importance of PCV2 and TTV2 natural co-infection in the pathology of porcine reproductive failures. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Anelloviruses are a group of single-stranded circular DNA viruses infecting humans and other animal species. Animal models combined with reverse genetic systems of anellovirus have not been developed. We report here the construction and initial characterization of full-length DNA clones of a porcine anellovirus, torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2), in vitro and in vivo. We first demonstrated that five cell lines, including PK-15 cells, are free of TTSuV1 or TTSuV2 contamination, as determined by a realtime PCR and an immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using anti-TTSuV antibodies. Recombinant plasmids harboring monomeric or tandem-dimerized genomic DNA of TTSuV2 from the United States and Germany were constructed. Circular TTSuV2 genomic DNA with or without introduced genetic markers and tandem-dimerized TTSuV2 plasmids were transfected into PK-15 cells, respectively. Splicing of viral mRNAs was identified in transfected cells. Expression of TTSuV2-specific open reading frame 1 (ORF1) in cell nuclei, especially in nucleoli, was detected by IFA. However, evidence of productive TTSuV2 infection was not observed in 12 different cell lines transfected with the TTSuV2 DNA clones. Transfection with circular DNA from a TTSuV2 deletion mutant did not produce ORF1 protein, suggesting that the observed ORF1 expression is driven by TTSuV2 DNA replication in cells. Pigs inoculated with either the tandem-dimerized clones or circular genomic DNA of U.S. TTSuV2 developed viremia, and the introduced genetic markers were retained in viral DNA recovered from the sera of infected pigs. The availability of an infectious DNA clone of TTSuV2 will facilitate future study of porcine anellovirus pathogenesis and biology. © 2012, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - An increased risk for colorectal cancer has been consistently reported for long-time consumption of cooked and processed red meat. This has frequently been attributed to chemical carcinogens arising during the cooking process of meat. Long-time fish or poultry consumption apparently does not increase the risk, although similar or higher concentrations of chemical carcinogens were recorded in their preparation for consumption. The geographic epidemiology of colorectal cancer seems to correspond to regions with a high rate of beef consumption. Countries with a virtual absence of beef in the diet (India) or where preferably lamb or goat meat is consumed (several Arabic countries) reveal low rates of colorectal cancer. In China, pork consumption has a long tradition, with an intermediate colorectal cancer rate. In Japan and Korea, large scale beef and pork imports started after World War II or after the Korean War. A steep rise in colorectal cancer incidence was noted after 1970 in Japan and 1990 in Korea. The consumption of undercooked beef (e.g., shabu-shabu, Korean yukhoe and Japanese yukke) became very popular in both countries. The available data are compatible with the interpretation that a specific beef factor, suspected to be one or more thermoresistant potentially oncogenic bovine viruses (e.g., polyoma-, papilloma- or possibly single-stranded DNA viruses) may contaminate beef preparations and lead to latent infections in the colorectal tract. Preceding, concomitant or subsequent exposure to chemical carcinogens arising during cooking procedures should result in increased risk for colorectal cancer synergistic with these infections.

AB  - The role of swine torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) as co-factors in disease syndromes involving porcine circovirus strain 2 (PCV2) and porcine reproductive and respiratory disease syndrome virus (PRRSV) has been a debatable subject. In this study, the prevalence of TTSuVs in Iowa, the leading pork producing state in the U.S., was estimated by a duplex PCR. The PCR is capable of simultaneously detecting both teno sus viruses 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and 2). Based on an analysis of 300 random samples representing six major geographical regions of the state, the overall prevalence rates for TTSuV1 and 2 were 47.34% and 24.67% respectively while the combined prevalence rate was 52.33%. The epidemiological association of TTSuV1 and 2 with the common etiological agents of the porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC) namely porcine PRRSV, PCV2, Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and swine influenza virus (SIV) was estimated in lung tissue derived from 45 pigs showing clinical signs of PRDC. Notably, 86.67% of the PRDC-suspect samples were positive for TTSuV1 in comparison to the baseline population prevalence rate of 47.34%. However, the prevalence of TTSuV2 (26.67%) was not significantly different. TTSuV1 was detected in 80.00%, 81.81%, 75.00% and 77.78% of the PRRSV, SIV, M. hyopneumoniae and PCV2 positive PRDC-suspect samples respectively. Our results indicate that TTSuV1 is strongly associated with clinical PRDC and support the hypothesis that TTSuVs might function as co-factors in PRDC. Further studies to define their possible role in the pathogenesis of swine respiratory diseases are warranted. © 2011.

AB  - Anelloviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with circular single stranded DNA, which infect a number of animal species as well as humans. In pigs, two distinct Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) species have been described so far, being one of them linked to disease occurrence. Specifically, TTSuV2 loads in serum have been found increased in pigs suffering from postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). Since this pathological condition is able to be controlled by means of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) vaccination, it was hypothesized the possibility that such vaccination would have an impact on TTSuV2 prevalence and loads. A total of 150 pigs were divided in two study groups. Half of them received a PCV2 commercial vaccine, while the other half remained as non-vaccinated controls. PCV2 infection was monitored at 3-4, 8, 12, 16 and 21 weeks of age by means of an standard PCR, while TTSuV2 loads were determined at 8, 16 and 21 weeks of age by a quantitative PCR. No obvious PMWS clinical signs were observed among studied animals, although PCV2 infection was confirmed in both groups of pigs. Almost all pigs got TTSuV2 infection throughout the study period, independently of the PCV2 vaccination status of animals. Moreover, TTSuV2 load did not show significant differences between different pig groups at each sampling time, but mean viral load increased with age. Taking into account that previous results suggest that TTSuV2 load in serum is increased in the background of PMWS, the present study suggests that this is not the case in a PCV2 subclinical infection scenario. Therefore, vaccination of PCV2 subclinically infected pigs did not modify the outcome of TTSuV2 infection. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torqueteno virus, named after the patient, is a novel DNA hepatitis virus associated with elevated transaminase level, which is also called transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) since it may be transmitted by blood transfusion. Genotyping of TTV is mainly based on N22 region (nt1939-2160) in ORF1 of TTV, at a length of about 230 bp. G1 genotype is found to be prominent in some countries in Asia, America and Europe, while G2 genotype in Brazil and Korea. High positive rates of TTV are observed in normal population and blood donors. However, the positive rate was significantly higher in populations at middle age than in other age groups. This paper reviews the progress in research on genotype and prevalence rate of human TTV in recent years.

AB  - In the present study, Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) was detected from different tissues, stool and serum samples of 25 sick pigs. The total prevalence of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were 64% (16/25) and 28% (7/25), 24% (6/25) were co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. The prevalence of TTSuV infection in spleen is a slightly higher, with positive rates of 52% (13/25) for TTSuV1 and 24% (6/25) for TTSuV2. Phylogenetic analysis of TTSuV1 showed that 21 isolates were distributed into two clusters (genotype TTSuV1a and TTSuV1b), with genotype TTSuV1b was the dominant genotype. Phylogenetic analysis of TTSuV2 showed that the nine isolates shared 80.9-99.2% nucleotide homology with each other, and were distributed in different genotypes (TTSuV2a-TTSuV2f). TTSuV2d was the most prevalent genotype in this study, which contained five Spanish strains and nine Chinese strains, and shared 94.2-96.8% homology. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Adenovirus (AdV), enterovirus (EV), genogroup A rotaviruses (GARV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) are non-enveloped viral agents excreted in feces and so may contaminate water bodies. In the present study, the molecular detection of these viruses was performed in samples of surface water collected from the Arroio Dilúvio, a waterstream that crosses the city of Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil, receiving great volumes of non-treated sewage from a large urban area. Sampling was performed during 2009, in three different occasions (January, April and September). The highest detection rate was observed for EV (64.28%), followed by TTV (28.57%) and AdV (21.43%). Rotaviruses were not detected. More than on kind of tested virus was detected in five (35. 71%) of 14 samples. January was the month with the highest viral detection rate, being all samples, collected in this month, positive for at least one group of tested virus. The correlation between the detection of these different viral agents and environmental factors is discussed. To the knowledge of the authors, this is the first description of viral genomes in water samples taken from the Arroio Dilúvio, Porto Alegre (Brazil).

AB  - To evaluate the effect of natural infection with TTSuV1 on the antibody response to vaccination with PRRS vaccine and clinical signs when co-infected with virulent PRRSV, 15 4-week-old TTSuV1-positive piglets and 20 TTSuV1-negative piglets were selected by PCR from two pig farms in Jiangsu province. TTSuV1-negative pigs were divided into four groups, and TTSuV1-positive pigs were divided into three groups. Experimental pigs were vaccinated with a PRRSV modified live virus (MLV) at 6 weeks of age and subsequently challenged with a virulent strain of PRRSV at 10 weeks of age. A TTSuV1-negative control group and an unvaccinated PRRS MLV control group were tested at the same time. The levels of antibody/cytokine and protective efficiency against PRRS MLV vaccine were evaluated. TTSuV1-infected/PRRSV-vaccinated pigs had lower levels of PRRSV antibody, as well as IFN-γ, IL-10 and T lymphocyte proliferation, than the TTSuV1-uninfected/PRRSV-vaccinated group (P < 0. 05, except IL-10) after vaccination at only one time point. TTSuV1-infected/PRRS MLV-vaccinated/PRRSV-challenged pigs had more severe clinical signs (P > 0. 05), more macroscopic lung lesions (P < 0. 05) and lower levels of PRRSV antibody (P < 0. 05 at 7 to 14 days post-PRRSV-challenge) than TTSuV1-uninfected/PRRSV-vaccinated/PRRSV-challenged pigs. These data indicate that TTSuV1 natural infection has an adverse effect on the development of host immune responses, suppresses immunization by the PRRS MLV vaccine, and exacerbates PRRS to a certain extent in pigs. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The first era in the discoveries of respiratory viruses occured between 1933 and 1965 when influenza virus, enteroviruses, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus and coronavirus (CoV) were found by virus culture. In the 1990s, the development of high throughput viral detection and diagnostics instruments increased diagnostic sensitivity and enabled the search for new viruses. This article briefly reviews the clinical significance of newly discovered respiratory viruses. RECENT FINDINGS: In 2001, the second era in the discoveries of respiratory viruses began, and several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been found: human metapneumovirus, CoVs NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus and human rhinovirus C and D groups. SUMMARY: Currently, a viral cause of pediatric respiratory illness is identifiable in up to 95% of cases, but the detection rates decrease steadily by age, to 30-40% in the elderly. The new viruses cause respiratory illnesses such as common cold, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Rarely, acute respiratory failure may occur. The clinical role of other new viruses, KI and WU polyomaviruses and the torque teno virus, as respiratory pathogens is not clear. © 2012 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Globalisation, in terms of the rapid and free movement of people, animals and food, has created a new paradigm, increasing the range and rate of distribution of many pathogens. In the present study, Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuVs) have been used as a model to evaluate the effects of global trade on viral heterogeneity, and how the movement of live pigs can affect the distribution and composition of virus populations. Seventeen countries from different parts of the world have been screened for TTSuV1 and TTSuvV2. High levels of genetic diversity have been found as well as two new TTSuV subtypes. A small fraction of this diversity (<5%) was related with spatial structure; however the majority (>50%) was best explained by the exchange of live pigs among countries, pointing to the direct relationship between the movement of hosts and the diversity of their accompanying viruses. Taking TTSuVs as sentinels, this study revealed that the distribution and diversity of comensal microflora in live animals subjected to global trade is shaped by the commercial movements among countries. In the case of TTSuVs, it appears that commercial movements of animals are eroding the genetic composition of the virus populations that may have been present in pig herds since their domestication. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Alterations of B cell subpopulations have been described up to date as characterizing advanced stage of HIV-1 infection. However, whether such defects are relevant in subjects with a preserved number of CD4+ T cells (350 cells/L) is unclear. In a cross-sectional study, we investigated if signs of B cells exhaustion and impaired viral immune surveillance are present in a cohort of 43 asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients with preserved CD4+ T cell counts (350 cells/L) and highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) untreated. A dramatic expansion of exhausted tissue-like memory B cells (CD 10 - CD2 1 l o w CD2 7 -) was observed. B cells alteration was related to an increase in Torque teno virus (TTV) load, used as surrogate marker of immune function. Successfully HAART-treated patients showed normalization of B cell subpopulations frequency and TTV load. These results provide new insights on B cell in HIV-1 infection and show that development of B cell abnormalities precedes CD4+ T cell decline. Copyright 2012 Manuela Fogli et al.

AB  - Currently virus surveillance in swine herds is constrained by the cost-effectiveness and efficiency of sampling methods. The objective of this study was to assess the value of using oral fluids collected by barn personnel as a method of surveillance based on PCR testing. Approximately 12,150 pigs in 10 wean-to-finish barns on 10 farms were monitored for the presence of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), influenza A virus (IAV), and Torque teno virus genogroups 1 (TTV1) and 2 (TTV2) by sampling oral fluid specimens. Oral fluid samples were collected from 6 pens at each site starting at the time of pig placement (∼3 weeks of age) and continuing thereafter at 2-week intervals for a period of 18 weeks. Data were analyzed both on a pen basis and barn basis. Overall, 508 (85%) samples were positive for PCV2, 73 (12%) for PRRSV, 46 (8%) for IAV, 483 (81%) for TTV2, and 155 (26%) for TTV1 during the study period. The estimated arithmetic means of the quantitative PCR-positive oral fluids for PCV2, PRRSV, and IAV were 1×10 4.62, 1×10 4.97, and 1×10 5.49per ml. With a single exception, all barns were positive for PCV2 and TTV2 at every sampling point in the study. Virus detection varied among barns, particularly for IAV and PRRSV. The pen level, cumulative distribution of agent combinations between all 10 barns were statistically different. The most commonly observed patterns were PCV2+TTV2 (239 pen samples, 40%), PCV2+TTV1+TTV2 (88 pen samples, 15%), and PCV2 alone (66 pen samples, 11%). This " proof-of-concept" project showed that a variety of viruses could be detected either intermittently or continuously in pig populations and demonstrated that barn herd virus status is highly variable, even among barns in the same production system. Oral fluid sampling is a promising approach for increasing the efficiency and cost effectiveness of virus surveillance in swine herds. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The newly established family Anelloviridae includes a number of viruses infecting humans (Torque teno viruses) and other animal species. The ones infecting domestic swine and wild boar are nowadays named Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV), which are small circular single-stranded DNA viruses highly prevalent in the pig population. So far, two genetically distinct TTSuV species are infecting swine. Both TTSuVs appear to efficiently spread by vertical and horizontal transmission routes; in fact, foetuses may be infected and the prevalence and viral loads increase by age of the animals. Detailed immunological studies on TTSuVs are still lacking, but it seems that there are no efficient immunological responses limiting viraemia. These viruses are currently receiving more attention due to the latest results on disease association. Torque teno sus viruses have been circulating unnoticed in pigs for a long time, and even considered non-pathogenic by themselves; there is increasing evidence that points to influence the development of some diseases or even affect their outcome. Such link has been mainly established with porcine circovirus diseases. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - This study was performed to clarify the sow-to-fetus transmission pathway of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) types 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). For this purpose, detection of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 (TTSuVs) in sera of 6 sows (Sows 1-6) at parturition and in sera of their newborn piglets immediately after birth without suckling colostrum was performed by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). These sows were bred using semen that had tested negative for TTSuVs. In a TTSuV1-and TTSuV2-positive sow (Sow 1), TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were detected in 4 and 5 of 12 newborn littermates, respectively. In a TTSuV1-positive sow (Sow 2), TTSuV1 was detected in 1 of 8 newborn littermates. In 4 TTSuV1-and TTSuV2-negative sows (Sows 3-6), TTSuV1 was detected in 6 out of the 25 newborn piglets of 3 sows (Sows 3-5), while TTSuVs were not detected in all 13 piglets of 1 sow (Sow 6). In addition, to investigate the possibility of a sow-to-piglet transmission pathway of TTSuV via colostrum, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in sera of 12 newborn piglets from Sows 1-3 were examined by nPCR. Immediately after birth without suckling colostrum, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were not detected in 10 and 8 of 12 newborn piglets, respectively; however, at 24 hr after suckling colostrum, TTSuV1 was detected in 6 piglets, while TTSuV2 was not detected in any piglets. These results confirmed the existence of a sow-to-fetus transmission pathway of TTSuV during normal pregnancy and suggested a possibility of sow-to-piglet transmission of TTSuV via colostrum. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

AB  - In the past two decades or so, a number of viruses have emerged in the global swine population. Some, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), cause economically important diseases in pigs, whereas others such as porcine torque teno virus (TTV), now known as Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), porcine bocavirus (PBoV) and related novel parvoviruses, porcine kobuvirus, porcine toroviruses (PToV) and porcine lymphotropic herpesviruses (PLHV), are mostly subclinical in swine herds. Although some emerging swine viruses such as swine hepatitis E virus (swine HEV), porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) and porcine sapovirus (porcine SaV) may have a limited clinical implication in swine health, they do pose a potential public health concern in humans due to zoonotic (swine HEV) or potential zoonotic (porcine SaV) and xenozoonotic (PERV, PLHV) risks. Other emerging viruses such as Nipah virus, Bungowannah virus and Menangle virus not only cause diseases in pigs but some also pose important zoonotic threat to humans. This article focuses on emerging and re-emerging swine viruses that have a limited or uncertain clinical and economic impact on pig health. The transmission, epidemiology and pathogenic potential of these viruses are discussed. In addition, the two economically important emerging viruses, PRRSV and PCV2, are also briefly discussed to identify important knowledge gaps. © 2012 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) is the essential component of porcine circovirus disease (PCVD) as the disease syndrome is referred to in Europe and porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD) as it is referred to in North America. Singular PCV2 infection rarely results in clinical disease; however, PCVAD is often accelerated in onset, enhanced in severity and prolonged in duration by concurrent viral or bacterial infections. Due to its effect on the immune system, PCV2 has also been shown to enhance protozoal, metazoal, and fungal infections. Several retrospective or cross-sectional studies have investigated the presence and prevalence of various infectious agents associated with PCVAD under field conditions. Experimental models confirm that PCV2 replication and associated lesions can be enhanced by concurrent infection with other viruses or bacteria. The exact mechanisms by which concurrent pathogens upregulate PCV2 are unknown. Co-infections may promote PCV2 infection by increasing immune host cell replication and accumulation in tissues thereby enhancing targets for PCV2 replication. It has also been proposed that co-infections interfere with PCV2 clearance by alteration of cytokine production and profiles. The outcome of differences in timing of co-infections in PCV2-infected pigs is also likely very important and is an area where more research is needed. Given the current knowledge base, it is important that veterinarians do a thorough diagnostic investigation on herds where PCVAD is a recurrent problem in order to implement the most appropriate and cost effective intervention strategies. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - It is well known that the immunity of patients with malignant tumors decreases significantly. An increased parvovirus B19 (B19) infection rate has been observed in immunocompromised hosts. However, only a small amount of literature regarding the risk of human parvovirus infection in patients with malignant tumors is available. To evaluate the correlation of human parvovirus infection with malignant tumors, 288 serum samples from patients with malignant tumors were screened for B19 DNA by nested-PCR. The serum samples, 156 of which were from known clinicopathological cancer patients, were subjected to analysis of the seropositive rate of human bocavirus (HBoV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) by PCR. A total of 800 normal population sera and 941 aspirate samples from children with respiratory tract infections were used as controls for the detection of B19 and HBoV, respectively. Pairwise comparison between cancerous serum and control samples, and the correlation between parvovirus infection and clinicopathological variables, including gender and cancer type, were evaluated using the χ2 test, Fisher's exact test or the t-test. P<0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. The overall prevalence of B19 DNA in cancer patients was 50.69% (146/288), which was significantly higher than that of the healthy controls with 4.5% (36/800) (Χ2 test, P<0.0001). Similar results were obtained for HBoV with a 39.74% (62/156) prevalence in cancer patients. However, the infection prevalence of HBV and TTV in the cancer patients was 5.13 (8/156) and 6.41% (10/156), respectively (P<0.0001), which was much less than that of B19 and HBoV. These results revealed that a high risk of B19 and HBoV infection occurred.

AB  - Background: Effective transfusion and chelation have prolonged the quality and longevity of life in thalassemics, who now survive into adulthood. Hence, adult physicians need to be aware of their clinical and laboratory profile and the problems faced by them.Aim: The present study was aimed to evaluate the clinical profile of adult thalassemics. Materials and Methods: Adult (>18 years) thalassemia major patients (n=19) were evaluated clinically and fasting pretransfusion blood samples were analyzed for complete blood counts, kidney and liver function tests, plasma glucose, serum ferritin, and thyroid hormone levels. Results: Average age was 21.65±2.47 years (range 19-28years), 42.1% had Body mass index (BMI) <18.5. Splenectomy had been performed in 47.4% before reaching adulthood, males significantly outnumbered females (72% vs. 12.5%). Hemoglobin levels <8<g/dl were observed in 31.6% and none had serum ferritin levels in the recommended range suggesting inadequacy of both transfusion and chelation. Indirect hyperbilirubinemia was observed in 21.1% patients although kidney functions, serum protein, and albumin were normal in all patients. Electrocardiographic abnormalities, diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism were absent. Five patients (26.3%) had contracted transfusion-transmitted viral infections - 21.1% and 5.3% respectively had antibodies to hepatitis C virus and HIV, while 5.3% were positive for Australia antigen. All patients were receiving chelation therapy - deferiprone alone (78.9%) or along with desferrioxamine (21.1%). Average dose of deferiprone being used was 95±8<mg/kg. Conclusion: Adult thalassemia major patients present with a distinct clinical profile having low BMI, generalized hyperpigmentation, most are splenectomized, have low hemoglobin, inadequate chelation and harbor transfusion-transmitted infections. Adult physician needs to be aware of this profile.

AB  - Viral infections have been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has frequently been investigated as a possible candidate and torque teno virus (TTV) has also been discussed in this context. Nevertheless, mechanistic aspects remain unresolved. We report viral replication, as measured by genome amplification, as well as quantitative PCR of two TTV-HD14 isolates isolated from multiple sclerosis brain in a series of EBV-positive and -negative lymphoblastoid and Burkitt's lymphoma cell lines. Our results demonstrate the replication of both transfected TTV genomes up to day 21 post transfection in all the evaluated cell lines. Quantitative amplification indicates statistically significant enhanced TTV replication in the EBV-positive cell lines, including the EBV-converted BJAB line, in comparison to the EBV-negative Burkitt's lymphoma cell line BJAB. This suggests a helper effect of EBV infections in the replication of TTV. The present study provides information on a possible interaction of EBV and TTV in the etiology and progression of multiple sclerosis. © 2012 Borkosky et al.

AB  - Background: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) are small, single-stranded circular DNA viruses belonging to the Anelloviridae family. Available studies clearly show that both viruses are widely distributed in the pig populations in America, Europe and Asia, although the impact of the infection is still unclear. Currently, the situation in domestic pig populations on the African continent is not known. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the possible presence of the two viruses in domestic pigs in Uganda, and describe the phylogenetic relationships to those in the rest of the world. Results: Ninety-five serum samples from six districts in Uganda were used, and PCR using TTSuV1 and 2 specific primers for the UTR region was run for viral nucleic acid detection. The positive samples were sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses performed in order to compare the Ugandan sequences with sequences from other parts of the world. The prevalence of TTSuV1 and 2 in the selected domestic pigs were estimated at 16.8% and 48.4% respectively, with co-infection found in 13.7%. The sequence identity was 90-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV1; and 63-100% between the Ugandan TTSuV2 sequences. Conclusion: This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV1 and 2 in domestic pigs in Uganda. These results highlight the importance of screening for emerging viruses given the globalisation of human activities. © 2011 Brink et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - We investigated the seroprevalence rate of Torque teno sus virus types 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) in the sera of 38 post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-suspected pigs and 43 porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2)-vaccinated normal pigs on 3 commercial pig farms in southern Japan by using nested polymerase chain reaction. High seroprevalence rate of TTSuVs was observed in both PMWS-suspected pigs (100%) and PCV2-vaccinated normal pigs (90.7%). The seroprevalence rate of TTSuV2 was significantly higher in the PMWS-suspected pigs than in PCV2-vaccinated normal pigs (97.4% versus 81.4%, P<0.05), whereas no such difference was observed for TTSuV1 between the 2 groups of pigs. In both pig groups, the seroprevalence rate of TTSuV2 was significantly higher than that of TTSuV1 (P<0.01-0.05). These results show that TTSuVs are highly seroprevalent in both PMWS-suspected pigs and PCV2-vaccinated normal pigs with TTSuV2 being more seroprevalent in the former than in the latter. © 2012 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.

AB  - Torque teno midi virus and small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) are members of the genus Gammatorquevirus within the family Anelloviridae. Cervical cancer is the second most prevalent cancer after breast cancer. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of infection by these viruses in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women from Isfahan, Iran. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue samples from cervical cancers (n = 42) and cervicitis cases (n = 79) were subjected to nested PCR to identify TTMDV/SAV viral sequences. Of the 42 tumor cases, 22, 18 and 2 were diagnosed as adenocarcinoma, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and squamous cell carcinoma, respectively. In total, 23 (55%) of the tumor samples were positive for TTMDV/SAV. Of the 79 cervicitis cases, 38 (48%) were also positive for TTMDV/SAV. This is the first report of TTMDV/SAV in cervicitis and cervical tumors of women. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Monitoring the emergence and re-emergence of viral diseases with the goal of containing the spread of viral agents requires both adequate preparedness and quick response. Identifying the causative agent of a new epidemic is one of the most important steps for effective response to disease outbreaks. Traditionally, virus discovery required propagation of the virus in cell culture, a proven technique responsible for the identification of the vast majority of viruses known to date. However, many viruses cannot be easily propagated in cell culture, thus limiting our knowledge of viruses. Viral metagenomic analyses of environmental samples suggest that the field of virology has explored less than 1% of the extant viral diversity. In the last decade, the culture-independent and sequence-independent metagenomic approach has permitted the discovery of many viruses in a wide range of samples. Phylogenetically, some of these viruses are distantly related to previously discovered viruses. In addition, 60-99% of the sequences generated in different viral metagenomic studies are not homologous to known viruses. In this review, we discuss the advances in the area of viral metagenomics during the last decade and their relevance to virus discovery, clinical microbiology and public health. We discuss the potential of metagenomics for characterization of the normal viral population in a healthy community and identification of viruses that could pose a threat to humans through zoonosis. In addition, we propose a new model of the Koch's postulates named the 'Metagenomic Koch's Postulates'. Unlike the original Koch's postulates and the Molecular Koch's postulates as formulated by Falkow, the metagenomic Koch's postulates focus on the identification of metagenomic traits in disease cases. The metagenomic traits that can be traced after healthy individuals have been exposed to the source of the suspected pathogen. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Multiple viral infections are common in pigs under intensive production conditions. All five of the viruses included in this study are associated with multifactorial diseases that cause significant economic losses in swine farming worldwide. The development is described of a novel multiple real-time PCR system based on the use of SYBR Green I that allows the simultaneous detection and differentiation of porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2), porcine parvovirus (PPV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and Torque teno sus virus species 1 and 2 (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) in pigs. The method was able to distinguish between all five viral agents, and tests of other DNA viruses proved the specificity of the system. The multiple real-time PCR system was sensitive, as the limits of detection ranged from 3.65×10 3 to 5.04×10 3 copies of DNA template per reaction. The coefficients of variation were low for both intra-assay and inter-assay variability. In addition, the results of the multiple real-time PCR system tests were 100% consistent with previous results based on specific PCR assay testing of field samples. This method could be a useful tool for epidemiological studies and disease management. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Recent studies on the torque teno virus (TTV), genus Anellovirus, have allowed formulating the hypothesis that TTV may trigger autoimmune rheumatic diseases or have some pathogenic role in them. Objectives: To determine the frequency of TTV infection in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the genetic diversity of TTV, the correlation between TTV infection and SLE clinical manifestations, and SLE clinical course and serological profile. Patients and methods: Serum samples were obtained from 46 SLE patients treated at the University-Affiliated Hospital of Campo Grande (NHU/FAMED/UFMS), Brazil. For controls, serum samples were obtained from 46 healthy volunteer blood donors. Viral DNA was extracted from samples using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) and amplified using nested PCR. Results: Positivity for TTV was found in 17 (37%) of SLE patients and in only seven (15.2%) of the controls (z test, P = 0.03). There was no correlation between TTV infection, SLE clinical manifestations, SLE clinical course, and the serological profile of the patients evaluated. Conclusion: Further studies on the presence of TTV in SLE patients are required. © 2012 Elsevier Editora Ltda. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: Torque teno virus (TTV) infects patients at risk for parenteral exposure and chronic blood transfusion, such as those with β-thalassemic. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of TTV infection and co-infection of TTV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in pediatric thalassemia patients receiving chronic blood transfusion. Material and Methods: The study included 90 pediatric thalassemia patients receiving chronic blood transfusion that presented to the Mofid Children's Hospital, Tehran, Iran. The control group included 90 healthy volunteer children. Serum TTV DNA detection via semi-nested PCR and HCV Ab were performed in all the participants. Demographic characteristics and clinical data were collected from each participant for statistical analysis. Results: In all, 64.4% of the patients had TTV infection, versus 24.4% of the controls (P < 0.01). The thalassemia patients had a greater probability of having TTV and HCV infections than the controls, with a common OR of 5.60 (95% CI: 2.94-10.69) and 2.15 (95% CI: 1.83-2.50), respectively. In total, 17.2% (10/58) of the patients that were TTV positive were also HCV positive, whereas 6.3% (2/32) of the TTV-negative patients were anti-HCV antibody (Ab) positive (P = 0.14). Conclusion: The prevalence of TTV and HCV infection was higher in the Iranian thalassemia patients on chronic transfusion therapy than in the controls. The high prevalence of TTV in pediatric thalassemia patients on chromic transfusion therapy may indicate the superiority of the parenteral route compared to other routs of TTV transmission.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous disease that develops as an interplay between the immune system and environmental stimuli in genetically susceptible individuals. There is increasing evidence that viruses may play a role in MS pathogenesis acting as these environmental triggers. However, it is not known if any single virus is causal, or rather several viruses can act as triggers in disease development. Here, we review the association of different viruses to MS with an emphasis on two herpesviruses, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). These two agents have generated the most impact during recent years as possible co-factors in MS disease development. The strongest argument for association of EBV with MS comes from the link between symptomatic infectious mononucleosis and MS and from seroepidemiological studies. In contrast to EBV, HHV-6 has been found significantly more often in MS plaques than in MS normal appearing white matter or non-MS brains and HHV-6 re-activation has been reported during MS clinical relapses. In this review we also suggest new strategies, including the development of new infectious animal models of MS and antiviral MS clinical trials, to elucidate roles of different viruses in the pathogenesis of this disease. Furthermore, we introduce the idea of using unbiased sequence-independent pathogen discovery methodologies, such as next generation sequencing, to study MS brain tissue or body fluids for detection of known viral sequences or potential novel viral agents. © 2012 Bentham Science Publishers.

AB  - Porcine periweaning failure-to-thrive syndrome (PFTS), an increasingly recognized syndrome in the swine industry of North America, is characterized by the anorexia of nursery pigs noticeable within 1 week of weaning, and progressive loss of body condition and lethargy during the next 1-2 weeks. Morbidity caused by PFTS is moderate, but case fatality is high. The etiology of PFTS is presently unknown and may include infectious agent(s), noninfectious factors, or both. PFTS was identified in a high health status farm with good management in early 2007. A diagnostic investigation was undertaken to identify the pathological lesions of, and infectious agents associated with, pigs demonstrating typical clinical signs. Affected (PFTS-SICK) and unaffected (PFTS-HLTHY) pigs from an affected farm, and unaffected pigs from 2 unaffected farms, were examined. The most prevalent lesions in PFTS-SICK pigs were superficial lymphocytic fundic gastritis, atrophic enteritis, superficial colitis, lymphocytic and neutrophilic rhinitis, mild nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis, and thymic atrophy. Rotavirus A and Betacoronavirus 1 (Porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus) were identified only in PFTS-SICK pigs, but the significance of the viruses is uncertain because PFTS is not consistent with the typical presentation following infection by these pathogens. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Porcine circovirus-2, Influenza A virus, Alphacoronavirus 1 (Transmissible gastroenteritis virus), Torque teno virus 1, Brachyspira hyodysenteriae, and Brachyspira pilosicoli were not identified in PFTS-SICK pigs. Suid herpesvirus 2 (Porcine cytomegalovirus), Porcine enteric calicivirus, Torque teno virus 2, pathogenic Escherichia coli, and coccidia were detected in both PFTS-SICK and PFTS-HLTHY pigs. It was concluded that there is a lack of compelling evidence that PFTS is caused by any of these pathogens. © 2012 American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians.

AB  - The paper reviews literature that evaluates the importance of the following groups of viruses in the etiology of diarrhea in pigs, that occur mostly from birth to weaning. These are as follows: Adenoviruses, Rotaviruses, Reoviruses, Picornaviruses, Enteroviruses, Caliciviruses and Astroviruses. Their common properties are: usually low and facultative pathogenicity, dependent on the level of innate immunity of the animal; participation as one of the factors of a multifactorial etiology, usually together with several taxonomically different viruses; contribution to the emergence of clinical symptoms in pigs, together with an unsatisfactory level of welfare which frequently occurs in large farms based on industrial technologies; very often occurring symptomless infections and carriership of these opportunistic microorganisms in healthy animals. These microorganisms predominantly represent RNA viruses and express a high frequency of variability of their genomes. As a consequence this may contribute to the emergence of new species, quasi-species, or variants in the enumerated groups of viruses, in addition to variants also pathogenic for humans. At present it is difficult to define which species or variants of the mentioned groups of viruses - besides the mentioned environmental factors - initiate the multifactorial, enteric disease of pigs. However it may not be excluded that Torque teno or PCV2 viruses and some bacterial enteropathogens, particularly E. coli serotypes pathogenic for swine, may be taken into account.

AB  - Background: The relationship between hepatic disorders and Transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) and the significance of parenteral transmission of TTV are controversial. The aim of this study was to compare the prevalence of TTV in injection drug users (IDUs), hemodialysis patients, and healthy blood donors, in Isfahan, Iran, at the year of 2010. Methods: In a case-control study, 108 subjects included 36 hemodialysis patients, 36 IDUs, and 36 healthy blood donors (as control group) were studied. Five-mL blood sample was taken from each subject on EDTA-containing tubes. Then DNA extraction was implemented using DNA extraction kit, and DNA reproduction was done using specific primers and probe by Rotor-Gene 6000 real-time PCR instrument. Findings: The mean of age in subjects was 38.7 ± 14.7 and 71 (66%) were male. Of 108 cases, 30 (27.8%) were TTV positive and 78 (72.2%) were TTV negative. The prevalence of TTV in IDUs 21 (58%) and hemodialysis patients 6 (17%) was higher than healthy blood donors 3 (8%) that was statistically significant (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: The prevalence of TTV in IDUs and hemodialysis patients is significantly higher than the general population in Isfahan, Iran. It seems necessary to make plans and policies to reduce the risk of TTV transmission to families of hemodialysis patient and IDUs, individuals who have close contact with them and health care workers.

AB  - A novel optical coherence tomography (OCT) reconstruction approach is introduced for improved visualization of inner-retina capillaries in retinal OCT tomograms. The proposed method utilizes a minimization framework based on a tensor total variation (TTV) energy functional, to enforce capillary structural characteristics in the spatial domain. By accounting for structure tensor characteristics, the TTV reconstruction method allows for contrast enhancement of capillary structural characteristics. The novel TTV method was tested on high resolution OCT images acquired in-vivo from the foveal region of the retina of a healthy human subject. Experimental results demonstrate significant contrast and visibility enhancement of the inner retina capillaries in the retinal OCT tomograms, achieved by use of the TTV reconstruction method. Therefore, the TTV method has a strong potential for improved disease progression analysis based on the study of disease-induced changes in the inner retina vasculature. © 2011 Optical Society of America.

AB  - Background: Porcine torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) is a small icosahedral and non-enveloped virus which contains a single-stranded (ssDNA), circular and negative DNA genome and infects mainly vertebrates and is currently classified into the 'floating' genus Anellovirus of Circoviridae with two species. Viral DNA of both porcine TTSuV species has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species has been documented in the United States, Europe and Asia. However, there exists no information about histopathological lesions caused by infection with porcine TTSuV2. Methods. Porcine liver tissue homogenate with 1 ml of 6.91 × 107genomic copies viral loads of porcine TTSuV2 that had positive result for torque teno sus virus type 2 and negative result for torque teno sus virus type 1 and porcine pseudorabies virus type 2 were used to inoculate specific pathogen-free piglets by intramuscular route and humanely killed at 3,7,10,14,17,21 and 24 days post inoculation (dpi), the control pigs were injected intramuscularly with 1 ml of sterile DMEM and humanely killed the end of the study for histopathological examination routinely processed, respectively. Results: All porcine TTSuV2 inoculated piglets were clinic asymptomatic but developed myocardial fibroklasts and endocardium, interstitial pneumonia, membranous glomerular nephropathy, and modest inflammatory cells infiltration in portal areas in the liver, foci of hemorrhage in some pancreas islet, a tiny amount red blood cells in venule of muscularis mucosae and outer longitudinal muscle, rarely red blood cells in the microvasculation and infiltration of inflammatory cells (lymphocytes and eosinophils) of tonsil and hilar lymph nodes, infiltration of inflammatory lymphocytes and necrosis or degeneration and focal gliosis of lymphocytes in the paracortical zone after inoculation with porcine TTSuV2-containing tissue homogenate. Conclusions: Analysis of these presentations revealed that porcine TTSuV2 was readily transmitted to TTSuV-negative swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in specific pathogen-free piglets inoculated with porcine TTSuV2. Those results indicated no markedly histopathological changes happened in those parenchymatous organs, especially the digestive system and immune system when the specific pathogen-free pigs were infected with porcine TTSuV2, hence, to some extent, it was not remarkable pathological agent for domestic pigs at least. So, porcine TTSuV2 could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious etiology of swine. This study indicated a directly related description of lesions responsible for TTSuV2 infection in swine. © 2011 Mei et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTV) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a circular single-stranded DNA genome, which are considered non-pathogenic. However, TTVs have been eventually linked to human diseases. TTVs infecting pigs, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), have been recently associated to porcine circovirus diseases (PCVD). To get more insights into such potential disease association, the aim of this study was to quantify TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral loads in serum of pigs affected by two PCVDs, postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS). Such study was carried out by means of a newly developed real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) method. Both TTSuVs were highly prevalent among studied pigs. TTSuV2 viral loads were significantly higher in PMWS affected animals, further supporting the previously suggested association between TTSuV2 and PMWS. On the contrary, TTSuV1 prevalence and loads were not related with the studied PCVDs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In late 2005, a postweaning, high mortality syndrome spread rapidly through finishing barns in swine dense areas of the United States. Diagnostic investigations consistently detected porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) from diseased tissues. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that the infectious agent was a PCV2 type termed " PCV2b" Prior to late 2004, only the PCV2a type, but not PCV2b, had been reported in North America. In this communication, we produce severe postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in gnotobiotic pigs using infectious PCV2a and PCV2b generated from DNA clones constructed from field isolates identified in the 2005 outbreak. Clinical signs exhibited by diseased pigs included anorexia, dyspnea and listlessness. Mortality was typically observed within 12. h of onset of dyspnea. The most striking microscopic lesions in affected animals were severe hepatic necrosis and depletion of germinal centers in lymph nodes with associated abundant PCV2 viral antigen. Clinical signs and lesions observed in these studies were comparable to those reported in experiments with gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with a PCV2a isolate while concurrently receiving immune-stimulation or co-infection with porcine parvovirus or torque teno virus. The animals in these studies were confirmed to be free of detectable porcine parvovirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus, swine hepatitis E virus, and aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. Seven out of 24 PCV2 inoculated pigs had a detectable congenital torque teno virus infection with no correlation to clinical disease. Thus, in these studies, both PCV2a and PCV2b isolates were singularly capable of inducing high mortality in the absence of any detectable infectious co-factor. © 2011.

AB  - The measurement of indicator organisms as an index of disease risk is accepted practice. Coliform bacteria have been used for over a century as an indicator of fecal contamination. However, outbreaks have occurred in systems with negative coliform results, and positive coliform results do not correlate well with negative health outcomes. It is widely recognized that pathogenic viruses do not behave in the environment in the same way as bacterial indicators, nor do they respond similarly to engineered treatment processes. A viral indicator may provide a more effective measure of likely health risks from infectious viruses. Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a small, unenveloped ssDNA virus first described in 1997. TTV occurs worldwide in humans, occurs in different serotypes between non-human animals and humans, does not appear to be associated with any significant morbidity, and appears to exhibit similar transport characteristics as pathogenic enteric viruses. This research is aimed at optimizing a method for monitoring TTV, a potential viral pathogen indicator in sources and drinking water. This paper reports on a PCR-based TTV detection assay that has been developed for environmental samples. The assay includes concentration via hollow fiber ultrafiltration (HFUF), secondary concentration using polyethylene glycol precipitation (PEG), nucleic acid extraction, purification of the extract to remove PCR inhibitors, and detection/ quantification using optimized traditional PCR. In our current work, we describe the assay and report on the occurrence of TTV using this assay to enumerate samples of animal feces and wastewaters from four geographical regions in the U.S. (Northeast, South, Midwest and West) to assess spatial variability and in multiple seasons to assess temporal variability. Continuing work is evaluating TTV occurrence in source and treated drinking waters. 2011 © American Water Works Association AWWA WQTC Conference Proceedings All Rights Reserved.

AB  - In this study, 40 pigs with respiratory and wasting disorders from Cuban swine herds were screened by PCR for the presence of TTSuV1, TTSuV2, PCV-2, PPV and CSFV in spleen samples. The variability of the porcine TTSuV sequences obtained was investigated by phylogenetic analysis. This study showed for the first time that TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 were present in Cuban swine herds. The investigation revealed the following infection rates: TTSuV1 40%, TTSuV2 37.5%, PCV-2 70%, PPV 37.5% and CSFV in 52.5%. The presence of two or more of these viruses at different rates in the same spleen samples was revealed. Also, a higher genetic diversity of TTSuV2 sequences was observed regarding TTSuV1 sequences. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Diversity of TTV1 was assessed in the head and neck region in patients with potentially malignant (oral lichen planus, oral leukoplakia) and malignant lesions (oral and laryngeal squamous cell cancers) and was compared to that found in the uterine cervix (cervical atypia and cervical cancer) by directly sequencing the NG061-063 segment of ORF1. These sequences were classified by the formerly used genogroupgenotype system as well as by the newly accepted species classification by aligning with the corresponding region of the type sequences of the 29 TTV species. All sequences obtained during the study clustered together with the TTV1 type sequence; to express diversity within TTV1, genotypes and subtypes of the former classification were used.The commonest subtypes were 2c followed by 2b, 1a and 1b. Subtypes 2b and 2c were evenly distributed among cervical samples; subtype 1a was more frequent in patients with cervical atypia or cancer. Subtypes 2c was more frequent than 2b in head and neck lesions. In conclusion, genotype and even subtype distribution may be important in association with diseases, therefore using this classification for characterization of intraspecies diversity of TTV1 is proposed. © 2011 Akadémiai Kiadó, Budapest.

AB  - Introduction: Epidemiological studies have shown that TTV is described worldwide in various populations. The prevalence of TTV viremia in healthy adults of developed countries is in the range of 1-34%. Prevalence reported from third world countries was found to be higher, typically 40-70%. In people who have received multiple blood transfusion; the virus is almost universally present with more than one subtype in each individual. Objectives: This study was carried out to determine the incidence of TTV infection among children's, wastewater, and drinking water, also genotyping of detected TTV strains circulating in the studied samples collected from Cairo. Subjects and Methods: stool samples were collected from 152 Children's with age range from 6 months to 12 years. Also, 45 wastewater samples and 45 drinking water samples were collected monthly from inlet and outlet from wastewater treatment plant (Zenin) and from El-Giza drinking water treatment plant. Collected samples were submitted to semi- nested PCR for amplification of 3' non translated region of TTV. The expected fragment sizes of PCR products were 390 bp and 271 bp for the first and second round of PCR, respectively. PCR products, of 2nd round of some positive samples, were purified for nucleotide sequence analysis in both directions. Fragments nucleotide sequences were compared to sequences derived from the corresponding TTV genome of the same regions deposited in the Gene Bank. Results and Conclusion: Obtained data showed that the incidence of TTV in children's stool samples was 59.2% (90/152), and in sewage samples was 64.4% (29/45), while it was 17.8% (8/45) in drinking water samples. Statistical analysis indicated that there no significant difference in TTV infection between male and female in infant and early childhood age groups. The phylogenic tree of positive samples confirmed that the isolated virus sequencing was 100% of nucleotide identity to TTV isolate isolated in Germany in 2001 and deposited in the GeneBank with accession no. AF435014, and the sequence of TTV isolated in the present study belong to TTV genotype 28.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis is a chronic immune-mediated disease of the central nervous system that develops in young adults with a complex genetic predisposition. Similar to other autoimmune disease, HLA-DR and -DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are by far the strongest risk-conferring genes. Less robust susceptibility effects have been reported for non-MHC related genetic variants. Improvements in the design of epidemiological studies helped to identify consistent environmental risk-associations such as the increased susceptibility for MS in individuals with a history of infectious mononucleosis, a symptomatic primary infection with the human γ-herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Sun exposure and serum vitamin D levels are emerging non-infectious environmental risk factors that may have independent roles. The analysis of environmental effects will likely expand in the next few years and will allow for the generation of testable hypotheses as to how environmental insults interact with genetic factors to jointly determine the susceptibility to MS. Insights gained from these studies might facilitate the development of prevention strategies and more effective treatments for MS. © 2011 Federation of European Biochemical Societies.

AB  - Background: Torque teno virus (TTV), of the Anelloviridae family, Iotatorquevirus genus, is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, and negative sense DNA (ssDNA) virus infecting human and many domestic animals including swines. Very little information is known about the investigations of TTV prevalence in different swine breeds so far. Methods. In this study, 208 serum samples collected from seven swine breeds (Rongchang pig, Chenghua pig, Zibet pig, Wild boar, Duroc, Landrace, Large Yorkshire) from two independent farms were detected to determine the prevalence of two swine TTV genogroups, TTV1 and TTV 2, by nested polymerase chain reaction methods, and to analyse prevalence difference among these breeds. Results: The results showed that the prevalence of TTV in the seven breeds was 92%-100%. No significant difference (p > 0.05) in TTV infection was observed between different breeds. Interestingly, significantly higher prevalence for TTV1 in Rongchang boars (90%) and for TTV2 in Rongchang sows (95%) were detected, while co-infection rate (43.8%) was lower than other breeds. Sequence analysis showed that the homology of TTV1 and TTV2 were over 90.9% and 86.4% in these breeds, respectively. Conclusions: The results indicated that TTV was widely distributed in the seven swine breeds. The prevalence of both TTV genogroups associated with swine breeds and genders. This study also respented the first description of swine TTV prevalence in different swine breeds. It was vitally necessary to further study swine TTV pathogenicity. © 2011 Wu et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Objective: To analyze the sequence of ORF1 protein of Torque teno virus to prepare for the future hybrid experiments. Metheds: The sequence of ORF1 protein of Torque teno virus was analyzed by bioinformatics using some web tools. Results: The most likely cleavage site was between position 14aa and 15aa and signal peptide may be position 1aa-14aa. Two possible transmembrane helices from inside to outside and three possible transmembrane helices from outside to inside were found. The position 509 (NKTN) was the potential N-glycosylation site. The speculative molecular weight of TTV ORF1 protein, which may be a kind of unstable protein was 88 705.7 Da. 1aa-91aa and 278aa-361aa were localized in non-regular secondary structure region. Conclusions: TTV ORF1 protein may be a nuclear protein which contains two non-regular secondary structure region. 265aa to 486aa and 510aa to 679aa may be the two approciate fragments to construct the plasmids, which would be prepared for the future hybrid experiments to study the functional positions of the protein and the interactions between TTV and its hosts. Bioinformatics analysis would possibly make it easier to study the protein's function. © 2011 Hainan Medical College.

AB  - An infectious etiology has been proposed for many human cancers, but rarely have specific agents been identified. One difficulty has been the need to propagate cancer cells in vitro to produce the infectious agent in detectable quantity. We hypothesized that genome amplification from small numbers of cells could be adapted to circumvent this difficulty. A patient with concomitant chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and polycythemia vera (PV) requiring therapeutic phlebotomy donated a large amount of phlebotomized blood to test this possibility. Using genome amplification methods, we identified a new isolate (BIS8-17) of torque teno virus (TTV) 10. The presence of blood isolate sequence 8-17 (BIS8-17) in the original plasma was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), validating the approach, since TTV is a known plasma virus. Subsequent PCR testing of plasmas from additional patients showed that BIS8-17 had a similar incidence (~20%) in CLL (n = 48) or PV (n = 10) compared with healthy controls (n = 52). CLL cells do not harbor BIS8-17; PCR did not detect it in CLL peripheral blood genomic deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (n = 20). CLL patient clinical outcome or prognostic markers (immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region [IGHV] mutation, CD38 or zeta-chain associated protein kinase 70kDa [ZAP-70]) did not correlate with BIS8-17 infection. Although not causative to our knowledge, this is the first reported isolation and detection of TTV in either CLL or PV. TTV could serve as a covirus with another infectious agent or TTV variant with rearranged genetic components that contribute to disease pathogenesis. These results prove that this method identifies infectious agents and provides an experimental methodology to test correlation with disease. © 2011 The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research.

AB  - Purpose of review: Increasing evidence suggests that the idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) result from certain environmental exposures in genetically susceptible individuals. Investigations have demonstrated that a variety of infections not only cause infectious myopathies but also could be possible triggers for IIM. This review summarizes published studies on the possible roles of infections in inflammatory muscle disease. Recent findings: Many infectious agents have been linked to the development of IIMs via case reports, epidemiologic investigations, and animal models. Additional agents possibly involved in triggering the development of IIMs have been recently described, including Torque teno virus (TTV) and Borrelia burgdorferi. Novel animal models of myositis have been recently developed using Leishmania infantum or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV). New technologies to assess infectious agents include high-throughput methods for pathogen identification and novel approaches to identify gene expression of pathogens in tissues. Summary: Understanding the causes of IIMs remains limited in part due to the rarity and heterogeneity of these disorders. Although no definitive studies have yet linked infectious agents with IIMs, additional evidence is accumulating and novel technologies may allow improved understanding of the roles of infections in IIMs and for possible future therapeutic and preventive measures. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence of HCV, HBV, and HIV infections among the patients with hemophilia. Patients with Hemophilia A and B were evaluated who visited hospital for factor replacement therapy. The viral markers tested in these patients included anti-HCV-Ab, HBsAg, and anti-HIV-Ab. Seroprevalence was compared from 5717 exchange healthy blood donors for same markers. A total of 173 multitransfused male hemophiliacs showed prevalence of 51.4% for HCV, 1.73% for HBV, and nil for HIV. In blood donors seroprevalence was 1.9% for HCV, 1.81% for HBV, while no HIV-positive case was detected. Prevalence of anti-HCV-Ab was significantly high in patients with hemophilia than normal donors (P =.0005). This study showed that HCV infection was more frequently identified than HBV and HIV infections in multitransfused hemophiliacs. The frequency of hepatitis C among blood donors is also higher than that of hepatitis B which is showing downward trend. © SAGE Publications 2011.

AB  - The diagnostics of respiratory viral infections has improved markedly during the last 15 years with the development of PCR techniques. Since 1997, several new respiratory viruses and their subgroups have been discovered: influenza A viruses H5N1 and H1N1, human metapneumovirus, coronaviruses SARS, NL63 and HKU1, human bocavirus, human rhinoviruses C and D and potential respiratory pathogens, the KI and WU polyomaviruses and the torque teno virus. The detection of previously known viruses has also improved. Currently, a viral cause of respiratory illness is almost exclusively identifiable in children, but in the elderly, the detection rates of a viral etiology are below 40%, and this holds also true for exacerbations of chronic respiratory illnesses. The new viruses cause respiratory symptoms like the common cold, cough, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, exacerbations of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Acute respiratory failure may occur. These viruses are distributed throughout the globe and affect people of all ages. Data regarding these viruses and the elderly are scarce. This review introduces these new viruses and reviews their clinical significance, especially with regard to the elderly population. © Jartti et al.

AB  - In the present study, the expression, generation and subcellular localization of Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV) proteins were characterized into two genetically distinct TTSuV species (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2). Following transfection of three TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 full-length ORF (ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3) expression constructs into porcine kidney cells, alternative splice variants encoding new TTSuV protein isoforms were identified for the first time. Proteins encoded from ORF1 and ORF3 were localized in the nucleoli of porcine kidney cells and that of ORF2 in the cytoplasm and nucleus excluding the nucleoli. The subcellular localization of the different protein isoforms was not only similar between distinct TTSuV species but also to the ones described in human Torque teno virus (TTV). Results of the present in vitro study were not based on full-length viral clones but suggested that alternative splicing strategy to generate TTSuV protein isoforms probably occurs in vivo. Obtained data provide new information on molecular biology of TTSuV and anelloviruses, which until now has been solely based on results obtained from human TTV. © 2011 SGM.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are vertebrate infecting, small viruses with circular single stranded DNA, classified in the Anelloviridae family. In pigs, two different TTV species have been described so far, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuVs have lately been linked to postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In the present study, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 prevalence and DNA loads in longitudinally collected serum samples of healthy and PMWS affected pigs from Spanish conventional, multi-site farms were analyzed. Serum samples were taken at 1, 3, 7, 11 and around 15 weeks of age (age of PMWS outbreak) and viral DNA loads determined by quantitative PCR. For both TTSuV species, percentage of viremic pigs increased progressively over time, with the highest prevalence in animals of about 15 weeks of age. TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 viral DNA loads in healthy and TTSuV1 loads in PMWS affected animals increased until 11 weeks of age declining afterwards. On the contrary, TTSuV2 DNA loads in PMWS affected pigs increased throughout the sampling period. It seems that TTSuV species differ in the in vivo infection dynamics in PMWS affected animals. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In the present study, a total of 158 fecal samples were collected from diarrheal dogs younger than 1 year old in pet clinic in China. 20 specimens (20/158, 13%) were positive for Torque teno canis virus DNA using detection PCR. One representative positive isolate designated LDL was randomly selected, cloned and sequenced. The complete genome of the LDL Chinese strain was 2799 nucleotides in length and contains three open reading frames (ORFs), which encode 576 (ORF1), 101 (ORF2), and 243 (ORF3) aa. Compared with the human and other animal TTV genomes, the genome of the LDL strain is clearly smaller and shares 95% identity with Japanese cf-TTV10 strain (AB076002). Phylogenetic analysis showed that the present Chinese Torque teno canis virus LDL strain was also closely clustered with the previous Japanese cf-TTV10 strain, and formed a different branch together with Torque teno sus viruses 1 and 2 compared with other Torque teno viruses, Torque teno mini virus, and Torque teno midi virus. Our study demonstrated that Torque teno canis virus is present in China. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno midi virus/small anellovirus (TTMDV/SAV) is a member of the family Anelloviridae. It has a single-stranded, circular, negative-sense DNA genome. Its pathogenic role in human disease remains to be confirmed. In this study, viral shedding, molecular epidemiology and genetic diversity of TTMDV/SAV were studied in human body fluids. Nasopharyngeal aspirates collected from children with acute respiratory disease were tested by PCR/nested PCR for TTMDV/SAV in two seasons (2005/2006, 2006/2007). Two years later, additional urine, stool, and serum samples and nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from eight symptomless children for follow-up investigation. Forty-three (46. 7%) of the 92 nasopharyngeal aspirates collected contained TTMDV/SAV. High genetic diversity was observed; however, identical sequences were also detected in two patients. The mean age of the infected children was 3 years (1 months-8 years), and 58% of them were female. Co-infection with RSV was detected in 23% of the samples. In a follow-up study, nasopharyngeal aspirates and serum of six (75%), stool samples of four (50%) and urine samples of two (25%) of the eight children were anellovirus-positive. None of the anellovirus sequences were identical in the two collection periods, but identical sequences were detected in different body fluids collected at the same time from the same child. TTMDV/SAVs shedding was detected in four human body fluids. As a consequence, it is possible that generalized infection and fecal/uro-oral transmission of TTMDV/SAV occur. TTMDV/SAVs are frequently present in nasopharyngeal aspirates, although the variants may only be transient agents. Further research is needed to investigate the pathogenesis and pathogenic role of TTMDV/SAV. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The study describes a novel rolling circle amplification (RCA) assay to detect members of the family Anelloviridae from swine and human serum samples. The RCA was carried out using short anellovirus (AV)-specific primers based on a highly conserved region among available AV full-length genomes. Then, RCA products were used as templates to amplify full-length genomes with an AV-specific PCR. Amplification products were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis and full-length genomes were isolated based on the known size. With this novel AV-RCA/PCR approach it was possible to detect Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2) in swine and many species of Torque teno virus (TTV) in human sera, which were previously tested negative by conventional PCRs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease of young adults which is characterized by autoimmune demyelination of the central nervous system. Interaction of genetics and environmental factors are required to cause MS. Among the proposed environmental factors for MS, viral infections are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV), which has recently been shown to infect humans, is a member of circoviridae, and has a circular DNA with 2,860 nucleotides. Since there are a few data about the pathogenicity of this virus, this study sought to investigate the presence of TTMV in sera from MS patients and healthy individuals. We studied 149 serum samples from MS patients and 150 sera of healthy individuals. Serum DNA was extracted using phenol-chloroform and was subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction. TTMV-DNA was detected in 24 (16%) sera of the healthy blood donors and in 21 (14.1%) samples of the MS patients, where the difference did not reach significance (p > .05). The result of this study could not establish an association between TTMV infection and MS. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc.

AB  - The family Anelloviridae comprises torque teno viruses (TTVs) diverse in genome structure and organization. The isolation of a large number of TTV genomes (TTV Heidelberg [TTV-HD]) of 26 TTV types is reported. Several isolates from the same type indicate sequence variation within open reading frame 1 (ORF1), resulting in considerably modified open reading frames. We demonstrate in vitro replication of 12 full-length genomes of TTV-HD in 293TT cells. Propagation of virus was achieved by several rounds of infections using supernatant and frozen whole cells of initially infected cells. Replication of virus was measured by PCR amplification and transcription analyses. Subgenomic molecules (μTTV), arising early during propagation and ranging in size from 401 to 913 bases, were cloned and characterized. Propagation of these μTTV in in vitro cultures was demonstrated in the absence of full-length genomes. © 2011, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Rationale: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive, uniformly fatal interstitial lung disease. An acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis isanepisode of acute respiratory worsening without an identifiable etiology. Occult viral infection has been proposed as a possible cause of acute exacerbation. Objectives: To use unbiased genomics-based discovery methods to define the role of viruses in acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Methods: Bronchoalveolar lavage and serum from patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, stable disease, and acute lung injury were tested for viral nucleic acid using multiplex polymerase chain reaction, pan-viral microarray, and high-throughput cDNA sequencing. Measurements and Main Results: Four of forty-three patients with acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis had evidence of common respiratory viral infection (parainfluenza [n = 1], rhinovirus [n = 2], coronavirus [n = 1]); no viruses were detected in the bronchoalveolar lavage from stable patients. Pan-viral microarrays revealed additional evidence of viral infection (herpes simplex virus [n = 1], Epstein-Barr virus [n = 2], and torque teno virus [TTV] [n = 12]) in patients with acute exacerbation. TTV infection was significantly more common in patients with acute exacerbation than stable controls (P = 0.0003), but present in a similar percentage of acute lung injury controls. Deep sequencing of a subset of acute exacerbation cases confirmed the presence of TTV but did not identify additional viruses. Conclusions: Viral infection was not detected in most cases of acute exacerbation of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. TTV was present in a significant minority of cases, and cases of acute lung injury; the clinical significance of this finding remains to be determined.

AB  - The natural history of mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) of the TT virus (TTV)was investigated retroand prospectively. Serum TTV DNA was detected in 37 out of the 195(19.0%)pregnant women without both HBV and HCV in their sera (NBCPW) and 21 out of the 84 (25.0%)pregnant women with HBV and/or HCV (BCCPW). In the latter group, 5 out of the 21(23.8%)TTV carrier pregnant women showed repeatedly sAST and/or sALT levels over 110U/L, but none of the former group did. With informed consent (IC), 14 (NBCPW) and 21 (BCCPW) infants were followed from birth up to 18 months of age by receiving tests for serum TTV DNA and levels of sAST and sALT. Eight out of the 14 infants (57.1%, NBCPW) and 9 out of the 21 infants(42.9%, BCCPW) developed TTV carrier-state, and all of these 17 carrier infants maintained serum TTV DNA-positive through the followup periods. No infants (NBCPW) showed elevated serum levels (>110 U/L) of AST or ALT during the follow-up periods, but 2 out of the 9 infants(22.2%, BCCPW) showed sAST or sALT levels higher than 110 U/L, and these 2 infants were found to be in HCV carrier-state. None of the infants developed a TTV-positive result within 1 month after birth, and thereafter 11.8% (2/17) developed carrier-state in 3 months, 47.1% in 6 months, 82.4% in 12 months. These findings may exclude the intrauterine or trans-vaginal infection as a mode of TTV MTCT. On the other hand, all carrier infants with one exception were raised by breast feeding, which was rich in TTV. Both carrier pregnant women and children, who were neither HBV nor HCV carriers, showed no abnormal liver function through the follow-up periods. Thus, we conclude that TTV MTCT occurs highly, but it is not so significant practically.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is an unenveloped circular single-stranded DNA virus with a diameter of 30 to 32 nm that was first described in 1997 in Japan. TTV was detected in various populations without proven pathology, including blood donors and in patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TTV DNA in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in southwest Iran. Viral TTV-DNA was studied in 442 samples (202 with HBV, 138 with HCV and 102 controls) collected from southwest of Iran. All the extracted serum DNA was amplified by TTV ORF1 gene specific primers using the semi nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TTV DNA was detected in the serum of 8.9 and 10.8% patients with chronic hepatitis B and C, respectively. The prevalence of TTV-DNA in the serum of the 102 controls was 2.9%. The results showed significant relationship of TTV with HBV and HCV in patients from T test examination (P < 0.01). The prevalence of TTV-DNA in Iranian hepatitis B and C patients was rather high when compared with those of other countries. To control and prevent the distribution of TT-virus, examination of the blood and blood products seems necessary. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV) has a single-stranded circular DNA genome and is currently classified into a new genus Iotatorquevirus with two species in a newly established family Anelloviridae. Viral DNA of both porcine TTV species (TTSuV1 and TTSuV2) has a high prevalence in both healthy and diseased pigs worldwide and multiple infections of TTSuV with distinct genotypes or subtypes of the same species has been documented in the United States and in Europe. However, the prevalence of specific TTSuV antibodies in pigs remains unknown. In this study, the putative ORF1 capsid protein from TTSuV2 isolate PTTV2c-VA was expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant ORF1 protein was used as the antigen for the development of Western blot and indirect ELISA to detect TTSuV2-specific IgG antibodies in pig sera. The results revealed a relatively high rate of seropositivity to TTSuV2 in conventional pigs from different sources but not in gnotobiotic pigs. Overall, pigs with undetectable TTSuV2 viral load were more likely to have a lower anti-TTSuV2 antibody level. An analysis of 10 conventional pigs during a 2-month period showed that decreased viral loads or presumed virus clearance were associated with elevated anti-ORF1 IgG antibody levels. Interestingly, porcine circovirus associated disease (PCVAD)-affected pigs had a significantly lower level of TTSuV2 antibody than PCVAD-unaffected pigs (p< 0.01). This is the first study to establish essential serodiagnostic tools for investigation of TTSuV seroprevalence and infection dynamics, which will help elucidate the potential pathogenicity of TTSuV infection in pigs. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV, genus Alphatorquevirus, family Anelloviridae) is a DNA virus, highly prevalent in populations from around the world. TTV isolates have been classified into five main phylogenetic groups (1-5) showing a large genetic distance between them. The presence of TTV has been detected in feces. However, whether all five TTV genogroups are excreted in feces and the frequency of these events are presently unknown. The presence of TTV DNA was assessed in feces from 135 Brazilian (0-90 years old) patients with gastroenteritis by using three PCR methods, including real-time PCR. One hundred twenty one (91.1%) samples were positive with at least one method. Using a genogroup-specific assay, it was shown that all genogroups were present. Thirty-seven (27.4%), 27 (20.0%), 57 (42.2%), 29 (21.5%), and 33 (24.4%) fecal samples contained TTV isolates belonging to genogroups 1-5, respectively. Coinfections with two, three, four, and five TTV genogroups were found in 23 (17.0%), 15 (11.1%), 7 (5.2%), and 7 (5.2%) fecal samples, respectively. Thus, 52 (38.5%) samples contained more than one TTV genogroup. Viral loads ranged from 2.6 to 6.5 log genome equivalents per gram of feces. However, only moderate variations of viral load were noted depending on genogroup and number of coinfecting TTV genogroups. These results show a high prevalence and a diversity of TTV isolates in feces. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: Although a marked proportion of thalassemic patients acquire Torque teno virus (TTV) through blood transfusion, its clinical importance is unclear. This study was designed to investigate the clinical importance of TTV infection in thalassemic patients with and without hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection in Iran. Methods: In this case-control study, 107 thalassemic patients on chronic transfusion and 107 healthy individuals were selected. According to HCV and TTV infection status (detected by semi-nested PCR), patients were categorized into 4 groups: TTV and HCV negative, TTV positive, HCV positive, and TTV and HCV positive. Blood ferritin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels in these 4 groups were assessed. Results: Approximately half of the thalassemic patients (50.5%) and 27.1% of controls had TTV infection. Thalassemic patients had a greater chance of TTV infection compared to the control group with a sex-adjusted OR of 4.13 (95% CI=2.28-8.13). The increased levels of ALT, AST, and ferritin in the TTV and HCV-infected group were not significantly different from those in the TTV and HCV negative group. Co-infection with TTV and HCV did not significantly increase ALT, AST, and ferritin levels compared to infection with TTV alone. Conclusion: Although common in thalassemic patients, TTV infection appears to have a negligible role in increasing the severity of liver disease, even when co-infection with HCV occurs. © 2011 Korean Society of Hematology.

AB  - The innate immune system represents the first barrier a microbe has to meet in order to colonize and infect the host. Even in vertebrates, the adaptive immune system is polarized on the basis of what is sensed by the innate immune system. Viruses interact with cells of the innate immune system mainly via Toll-like receptors (TLRs): in particular, unmethylated CpG dinucleotides in the genome of DNA viruses can bind TLR9 [Krug et al., 2001] in addition to KIR3DL2 [Sivori et al., 2010]. TLR-9 binding can have stimulatory or inhibitory effects according to the exact sequence of the CpG motif [Krieg, 2002], and the cumulative effect of stimulatory and inhibitory motifs within a genome has been called the "CpG index." Extending previous observations by other investigators [Hoelzer et al., 2008], we calculated the CpG index for many single- (Anelloviridae, Parvoviridae) and double-stranded (Poliomaviridae and Poxviridae) DNA viruses using genomes from the publicly available reference sequences (RefSeq) in Genbank. A spectrum of indexes ranging from positive (+3.8 for bocavirus) to negative (-6.653 for vaccinia virus) resulted (Table I). An attempt was made to group viruses according to their CpG index and we checked for common denominators in their clinical impact. DNA viruses with a high CpG index (e.g., adenovirus type 12 [Krieg et al., 1998], herpesviruses, TTV, parvovirus B19, and bocavirus) stimulate strongly innate immunity with a potential of leading to autoimmunity [Maggi and Bendinelli, 2009] and are subject to a strict immunosurveillance. When they are not cleared they usually become latent accompanied by methylation of CpG motifs [Winocour et al., 1965; Gunthert et al., 1976; Szyf et al., 1985; Badal et al., 2003], and increase in replication only during mild immunosuppression [Maggi et al., 2008], but are rarely directly pathogenic per se. DNA viruses with neutral CpG index (e.g., polyomavirus and parvovirus 4) are likely to become symbionts and make life-threatening damage only during heavy immunosuppression, either iatrogenic or disease associated. In contrast, DNA viruses with negative CpG indexes (e.g., adenovirus type 2 and 5 [Krieg et al., 1998], and poxviruses), by evading innate immunity, are subject to very poor immune surveillance and can replicate without control, resulting in life-threatening illness or chronic infection even in immunocompetent hosts. Of interest, vaccinia virus requires additional skin damage by scarification for inducing tissue inflammation in order to elicit protective immunity. It is suggested that a classification of DNA viruses according to their ability to stimulate the innate immune system is now feasible and clinically sound. Although this classification cannot make predictions on cell tropism, prevalence in the healthy population, or ability to be cleared effectively by the adaptive immune system, it may be useful for predicting the pathogenicity of emerging DNA viruses. © 2011 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Lookback is considered when human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is detected in a repeat blood donor in case the immediately previous negative donation was donated in the infectious window period (IWP) or the assay(s) produced a false-negative result. HIV lookback investigations undertaken by NHS Blood and Transplant and the Welsh Blood Service between October 1995 and December 2008 are described. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Investigations were undertaken into the previous negative donations of 113 HIV-infected donors, including retrospective testing of archive samples, tracing of components, and identification of recipients who were offered HIV testing when appropriate. Data were collated on HIV seroconverters and outcome of the lookback was summarized. RESULTS: Two previous negative donations given before the introduction of minipool nucleic acid testing (MP-NAT) screening were confirmed positive by individual retrospective polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of the archive specimen. Red blood cell components had been transfused from both donations. One recipient died after transfusion, and the other was alive and tested HIV positive. All 23 (20%) donations previously testing negative by MP-NAT were confirmed to be PCR negative on individual testing of an archive specimen and none of the tested recipients of these donations had evidence of transfusion-transmitted HIV. CONCLUSION: The yield of lookback was low with one positive recipient identified over 13 years of surveillance: HIV transmission occurred from a window period donation given before the introduction of MP-NAT screening and would have been detected using current testing methods. Current residual risk estimates for the United Kingdom predict that HIV lookback will be of limited benefit, as demonstrated by our data. © 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - Patients with abnormal aminotransferases and no evidence of HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV or HEV infection may have infections due to other hepatitis viruses. Most of these non-A, non-E hepatitides are due to Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus infection, and may be more severe and prolonged in the immunocompromised host. Usually, the alterations of liver tests are minor and short-lived, and liver-related symptoms or signs are absent. Liver pathology is non-specific. Protracted alterations of liver tests are uncommon and chronic sequelae practically non-existent. Severe acute forms may, however, evolve into liver failure and death. Specific antiviral treatment, where available, is needed only for these cases. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Thirteen genomes of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2) were obtained to examine the diversity and evolution of swine TTVs. Despite the low nucleotide identity reported, the genomic organization and transcriptional profiles of TTVs are similar. The nucleotide diversity for TTSuV1 was higher than TTSuV2, and the pattern of mutation among the ORFs was also different. Phylogenetic and genetic analyses support the proposed division of TTV into two species. TTSuV1 showed high levels of variability (>30%), with three different types (the third described for the first time) that may display a geographical structure. In contrast, TTSuV2 showed lower levels of variability (<15%), and no different types could be described. Larger values for the ratios of synonymous (dS) to non-synonymous (dN) base substitutions (dS/dN) were reported for the ORFs pointing to a certain level of selective constraint in TTV genomes. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno sus virus (TTSuV), a member of the family Anelloviridae, is a single-stranded, circular DNA virus, widely distributed in swine populations. Presently, two TTSuV genogroups are recognized: Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTSuV2). TTSuV genomes have been found in commercial vaccines for swine, enzyme preparations and other drugs containing components of porcine origin. However, no studies have been made looking for TTSuV in cell cultures. In the present study, a search for TTSuV genomes was carried out in cell culture lineages, in sera used as supplement for cell culture media as well as in trypsin used for cell disaggregation. DNA obtained from twenty-five cell lineages (ten from cultures in routine multiplication and fifteen from frozen ampoules), nine samples of sera used in cell culture media and five batches of trypsin were examined for the presence of TTSuV DNA. Fifteen cell lineages, originated from thirteen different species contained amplifiable TTSuV genomes, including an ampoule with a cell lineage frozen in 1985. Three cell lineages of swine origin were co-infected with both TTSuV1 and TTSuV2. One batch of trypsin contained two distinct TTSuV1 plus one TTSuV2 genome, suggesting that this might have been the source of contamination, as supported by phylogenetic analyses of sequenced amplicons. Samples of fetal bovine and calf sera used in cell culture media did not contain amplifiable TTSuV DNA. This is the first report on the presence of TTSuV as contaminants in cell lineages. In addition, detection of the viral genome in an ampoule frozen in 1985 provides evidence that TTSuV contamination is not a recent event. These findings highlight the risks of TTSuV contamination in cell cultures, what may be source for contamination of biological products or compromise results of studies involving in vitro multiplied cells. © 2011 Teixeira et al.

AB  - Hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is an uncommon but distinct variant of aplastic anemia in which pancytopenia appears two to three months after an acute attack of hepatitis. HAAA occurs most frequently in young male children and is lethal if leave untreated. The etiology of this syndrome is proposed to be attributed to various hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses. Several hepatitis viruses such as HAV, HBV, HCV, HDV, HEV and HGV have been associated with this set of symptoms. Viruses other than the hepatitis viruses such as parvovirus B19, Cytomegalovirus, Epstein bar virus, Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) and non-A-E hepatitis virus (unknown viruses) has also been documented to develop the syndrome. Considerable evidences including the clinical features, severe imbalance of the T cell immune system and effective response to immunosuppressive therapy strongly present HAAA as an immune mediated mechanism. However, no association of HAAA has been found with blood transfusions, drugs and toxins. Besides hepatitis and non hepatitis viruses and immunopathogenesis phenomenon as causative agents of the disorder, telomerase mutation, a genetic factor has also been predisposed for the development of aplastic anemia. Diagnosis includes clinical manifestations, blood profiling, viral serological markers testing, immune functioning and bone marrow hypocellularity examination. Patients presenting the features of HAAA have been mostly treated with bone marrow or hematopoietic cell transplantation from HLA matched donor, and if not available then by immunosuppressive therapy. New therapeutic approaches involve the administration of steroids especially the glucocorticoids to augment the immunosuppressive therapy response. Pancytopenia following an episode of acute hepatitis response better to hematopoietic cell transplantation than immunosuppressive therapy. © 2011 Rauff et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In the present study, two isolates (SH-F1 and SH-F2) of Torque teno felis virus (feline TTV) were detected in 16 (12.5%) serum samples collected from cats in China. Their full length genomes were cloned and sequenced. The results showed that they were 2063. bp in length and contained three open reading frames (ORFs) (ORF1: nt438-1748, ORF2: nt268-585 and ORF3: nt268-581, 1461-1842). Phylogenetic analysis showed that they were clustered with the strain of Japan (Fc-TTV4, AB076003) and the strain of France (PRA4, EF538878). Sequence analysis indicated that SH-F1 had high (97.5% and 93.3%) identity with the strain of Japan and the strain of France, and SH-F2 shared 94.5% and 92.1% homology with them, respectively. In conclusion, we demonstrated that feline TTV is present in China. © 2010.

AB  - In the present retrospective study, serum samples from a total of 253 pigs of different age groups from 83 farms collected in the year 2008 were included. The sera were analysed for the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2. Furthermore, the correlation between TTV and PCV-2 was investigated. 62.1 % of the pigs were positive for TTV1 and/or TTV2 by PCR. 21.7 % of the samples were positive for TTV1 and TTV2, 16.2 % only for TTV1 and 23.3 % only for TTV2. In 80.7 % of the investigated farms at least one animal was TTV positive. In the growing and fattening period significantly more pigs were positive for TTV than in other age classes. A positive association was found between TTV1 and IgM against PCV-2, between TTV2 and PCV-2 results by in situ hybridisation (ISH) as well as TTV1 and TTV2 and PCV-2 results by qPCR. A significant correlation could also be seen between the diagnosis "porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC)" and the detection of TTV, whereas there was none to the diagnosis "porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS)". In the present study, TTV was detected in Austria for the first time. © 2011 Schlütersche.

AB  - Torque teno sus viruses (TTSuV) were detected in the pig population in the Czech Republic by a nested PCR technique. The prevalence of individual TTSuV was found to be 42.9% (TTSuV1) and 46.7% (TTSuV2). The prevalence for TTSuV 1 and TTSuV2 was determined to be 52.7% and 60. 6% in piglets at weaning, 90.9% and 63.6% in gilts, and 75% and 87.5% in sows, respectivel y. Both virus species were detected in 12% of newborn piglets, which suggests possible transplacental transmission. Sequencing of several virus strains showed that the sequenced TTSuV strains belong to two different species of viruses. The average similarity on the nucleotide levels between these two species was 43.3%. © 2011 Institute of Microbiology, v.v.i, Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic.

AB  - The presence of pathogenic viruses in healthcare settings represents a serious risk for both staff and patients. Direct viral detection in the environment poses significant technical problems and the indirect indicators currently in use suffer from serious limitations. The aim of this study was to monitor surfaces and air in hospital settings to reveal the presence of hepatitis C virus, human adenovirus, norovirus, human rotavirus and torque teno virus by nucleic acid assays, in parallel with measurements of total bacterial count and haemoglobin presence. In total, 114 surface and 62 air samples were collected. Bacterial contamination was very low (&lt;1cfu/cm 2) on surfaces, whereas the 'medium' detected value in air was 282cfu/m 3. Overall, 19 (16.7%) surface samples tested positive for viral nucleic acids: one for norovirus, one for human adenovirus and 17 (14.9%) for torque teno virus (TTV). Only this latter virus was directly detected in 10 air samples (16.1%). Haemoglobin was found on two surfaces. No relationship was found between viral, biochemical or bacterial indicators. The data obtained confirm the difficulty of assessing viral contamination using bacterial indicators. The frequent detection of TTV suggests its possible use as an indicator for general viral contamination of the environment. © 2010 The Hospital Infection Society.

AB  - A novel simultaneous detection system for human viruses was developed using a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system to identify causes of infection in clinical samples from patients with uncertain diagnoses. This system, designated as the "multivirus real-time PCR," has the potential to detect 163 human viruses (47 DNA viruses and 116 RNA viruses) in a 96-well plate simultaneously. The specificity and sensitivity of each probe-primer set were confirmed with cells or tissues infected with specific viruses. The multivirus real-time PCR system showed profiles of virus infection in 20 autopsies of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome patients, and detected frequently TT virus, cytomegalovirus, human herpesvirus 6, and Epstein-Barr virus in various organs; however, RNA viruses were detected rarely except for human immunodeficiency virus-1. Pathology samples from 40 patients with uncertain diagnoses were examined, including cases of encephalitis, hepatitis, and myocarditis. Herpes simplex virus 1, human herpesvirus 6, and parechovirus 3 were identified as causes of diseases in four cases of encephalitis, while no viruses were identified in other cases as causing disease. This multivirus real-time PCR system can be useful for detecting virus in specimens from patients with uncertain diagnoses. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objectives: To establish prevalence and phylogenetic relationship of SEN virus (SENV) D and H in blood donors from Scotland, Czech Republic and Ghana. Aim: To compare the data between three regions with differing prevalence of blood-borne viruses. Background: Anelloviruses are a ubiquitous group of viruses without a clear disease association. Although there is little evidence that they are pathogenic per se, they may have the ability to modify ongoing disease processes. They have a high degree of heterogeneity both within populations and across geographic regions. Materials and Methods: Three sets of donor samples were analysed by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and hybridisation. A proportion of amplified samples were sequenced and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. Results: The prevalence figures (including mixed D + H infection) were established for SENV D: 1.0, 8.4 and 25.2% and H: 12.5, 34.8 and 61.0% in Scottish, Czech and Ghanaian blood donors, respectively. The compilation of prevalence figures indicates the changing ratio of SENV D/H in west-east direction, most obvious between Western Europe (D/H < 1) and far East Asia (D/H > 1). Phylogenetic analysis grouped the samples mostly in accordance with geographic origin, despite the variability of short sequence analysed. The previously indicated link between SENV prevalence and age was statistically significant in this study, only for SENV H in Czech samples. Conclusion: SENV D and H appear to reflect the incidence of other blood-borne viruses in these locations. SENV H prevalence of 45.4% in Ghana represents the highest single-SENV-genotype prevalence described in blood donors to date. © 2010 The Authors.

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors jointly determine the susceptibility to develop Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Collaborative efforts during the past years achieved substantial progress in defining the genetic architecture, underlying susceptibility to MS. Similar to other autoimmune diseases, HLA-DR and HLA-DQ alleles within the HLA class II region on chromosome 6p21 are the highest-risk-conferring genes. Less-robust susceptibility effects have been identified for MHC class I alleles and for non-MHC regions. The role of environmental risk factors and their interaction with genetic susceptibility alleles are much less well defined, despite the fact that infections have long been associated with MS development. Current data suggest that infectious triggers are most likely ubiquitous, i.e., highly prevalent in the general population, and that they require a permissive genetic trait which predisposes for MS development. In this review article, we illustrate mechanisms of infection-induced immunopathologies in experimental animal models of autoimmune CNS inflammation, discuss challenges for the translation of these experimental data into human immunology research, and provide future perspectives on how novel model systems could be utilized to better define the role of viral pathogens in MS. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Abstract. Background: Aplastic anemia (AA) is a serious and rare disorder characterized by a hypocellular bone marrow. Hepatitis associated aplastic anemia (HAAA) is a variant of aplastic anemia in which aplastic anemia follows an acute attack of hepatitis. Several reports have noted an association between HGV and hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia besides other hepatitis causing viruses. Case presentation. A female girl of age 11 year with a history of loose motion for one month, vomiting for last 15 days and poor oral intake for last few days is reported here. The physical examination presents fever, pallor whereas bleeding, hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and bruising were absent, abdominal ultrasonography confirmed the absence of hepatomegaly, Splenomegaly and lymphodenopathy. The laboratory investigation parameters were: haemoglobin 6.2 g/L, total leucocytes count 1.51, neutrophils 0.47%, absolute reticulocyte count 0.5%, Monocytes 0.16%, red cell count 3.2 mil/uL, Picked cell volume (PCV) 30.13%, Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV) 78 fL, Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin (MCH) 26.3 pg. The liver enzymes were alanine aminotransferease (ALT) 98 IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 114 IU/L. Serologic and molecular tests for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, TTV, B19 were negative, whereas HGV RNA PCR test was found positive for hepatitis G virus. The bone marrow aspirate and trephine biopsy examination revealed hypo- cellularity, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Conclusion: HAAA is an uncommon but severe condition, which may occur following idiopathic cases of acute hepatitis. Our finding suggests the involvement of HGV in the development of aplastic anemia. In patients presenting with pancytopenia after an episode of acute hepatitis, the definitive diagnosis should be considered and confirmed by RT-PCR and if possible by bone marrow biopsy. © 2011 Riaz Shah et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - A reliable indicator is needed to predict and reduce the risk of infection associated with fecal contamination of surface water. Since Pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), human picobirnaviruses (hPBV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) have been detected at substantial levels in human feces, we explored whether detection of nucleic acids of these viruses is a suitable indicator of fecal contamination in river water. From September 2008 to December 2009, water samples (n = 111) were collected from the Ruhr and Rhine rivers and from the influents and effluents of a wastewater plant (n = 12). Quantitative real time (RT-) PCR was used to determine the abundance of PMMoV, hPBV, and TTV in comparison to human adenoviruses (HAdV) and human polyomaviruses (HPyV) that are frequently detected in surface water and were previously proposed as indicators. While PMMoV was detected in all river water samples, the other viruses were detected less frequently. The concentration of the studied viruses in positive river water ranged from 5 × 101 to 1.07 × 106 genome equivalents per liter (gen.equ./l). All wastewater samples were positive for PMMoV, HAdV and HPyV, while TTV and hPBV were detected in 6/12 and 3/12 of samples, respectively. To determine if PMMoV is specific to human-derived fecal waste, fecal samples from human (n = 20) and animal (n = 53) were also tested. In contrast to the ubiquity of PMMoV in human feces (19/20) the virus was only detected at low concentration in a minority of the animal fecal samples tested (7/15 from chicken, 1/10 from Geese and 1/6 from cows). Therefore, in this setting TTV and hPBV do not seem to be suitable indicators of fecal contamination in water. Whereas, the high excretion level and dissemination of PMMoV in human sewage and river water suggest that PMMoV could be a promising indicator of fecal pollution in surface water. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Summary Objective: Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) and torque-teno-susviruses (TTSuV) are ubiquitous in all pig-producing countries. Both pathogens are transmitted horizontally as well as vertically, and semen could be an important means of transmission. Aim of this study was the investigation of the prevalence of these two viruses in boar semen. Material and methods: Single semen samples from 100 boars from an artificial insemination centre were analysed by quantitative real time PCR for PCV2 and by conventional PCR for TTSuV-1 and TTSuV-2. Results: Only one Piétrain boar of age of 47 months showed a measurable PCV-2 quantity of 7.56 × 103/ml semen. Four samples were PCRpositive for TTSuV-1, and five for TTVSu-2, while in a single co-infection both TTSuVs were detected.All TTSuV-positive samples originated from Piétrain boars. Conclu sion and clinical relevance: This study represents the first descrip tion of TTSuV presence in semen in Austria. The prevalence of TTSuV as well as PCV-2 was low. The clinical relevance of a simultaneous contamination of boar semen with both pathogens remains unclear. © Schattauer 2011.

AB  - Oral lichen planus (OLP) is frequently associated with hepatitis C virus infection but uncommonly with other causes of liver disorder. The authors report the case of a 41-year-old male patient with a clinical and histological diagnosis of OLP who presented with a marked alteration of the transaminase values, with no signs of past or present HBV, HCV, HGV or TTV infection. The patient did not consume alcohol and no exposure to hepatotoxic substances was reported. All autoantibodies were negative. Hepatic fine needle biopsy showed macrovesicular steatosis with a slight chronic portal inflammatory infiltrate and signs of siderosis. Iron metabolism was slightly altered. Genetic tests showed a heterozygotic mutation for hereditary haemochromatosis gene (HLA-H C282Y) but not for HLA-H63D. The patient presented slight insulin resistance but had normal glycaemic values. The results are consistent with a diagnosis of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This is the first reported case of NASH associated with OLP. © 2010 International Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

AB  - Background: In non-obstructive azoospermia (NOA), testicular sperm extraction (TESE) is successful in ∼50 of cases. A parameter for predicting TESE quality and pregnancy rates after ICSI of testicular spermatozoa is still lacking.Methods: We retrospectively evaluated the total testicular volume (TTV), hormone levels and TESE quality in 280 patients with NOA. After successful TESE, the characteristics of the ICSI cycles and the take-home baby rates were evaluated.Results: TESE was successful in 149 patients (53.2). In a multivariate logistic regression analysis, only TTV, FSH and inhibin B were correlated with the TESE outcome. A score including these three parameters was the best predictor of successful TESE (positive likelihood ratio: 3.01). When the score was <18.5, TESE was successful in 77.4 of cases and 'sperm rich' (i.e. yielding >100 spermatozoa) in 91.1 of cases; 42.8 of couples took a baby home. The take-home baby rate did not depend on whether the score was <18.5 or between 18.5 and 3700. If the score was >3700, TESE was successful in 37.8 of cases and 'sperm rich' in 14.3 of cases; only one couple took a baby home (a rate of 7.7 versus 42.8 when the score was <18.5; P< 0.001). Owing to low sperm retrieval on the day of oocyte retrieval, fewer oocytes were injected when the score was >3700 than when <3700. Conclusions: Thanks to better knowledge of TESE quality, the present score could help to improve care and pre-ICSI counseling for patients with NOA. © 2011 The Author.

AB  - Background: Transfusion-transmitted infections and immunologic effects of viable residual lymphocytes remain a concern in red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. Pathogen reduction technologies for RBC components are under development to further improve transfusion safety. S-303 is a frangible anchor-linker-effector with labile alkylating activity and a robust pathogen reduction profile. This study characterized the viability of RBCs prepared with a second-generation S-303 process and stored for 35 days. Study Desing and Methods: This was a two-center, single-blind randomized, controlled, crossover study in 27 healthy subjects. S-303 (test) or control RBCs were prepared in random sequence and stored for 35 days, at which time an aliquot of radiolabeled RBCs was transfused. The 24-hour recovery, RBC life span, and in vitro metabolic and viability variables were analyzed. Results: The mean 24-hour RBC recovery and hemolysis of test RBCs were similar to control RBCs and were consistent with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidance for RBC viability. The mean differences in life span and median life span (T 50) of circulating test RBCs were 13.7 and 6.8 days, while the mean difference in the area under the curve of surviving RBCs was 1.38%, in favor of control RBCs. There were no clinically relevant abnormal laboratory values after the infusion of test RBCs. All crossmatch assays of autologous S-303 RBCs were nonreactive. ConclusionS: RBCs prepared using the S-303 pathogen inactivation process were physiologically and metabolically suitable for transfusion after 35 days of storage, met the FDA guidance criteria for 24-hour recovery, and did not induce antibody formation. © 2011 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - Aim: To determine the influence of TTV and SENV on histological findings and viral response in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. Background: The clinical impact of TTV or SENV coinfections in these patients remains unclear. Methods: Serum and liver biopsy specimens from chronic hepatitis B and C patients, 107 with liver biopsy and 105 who had finished complete antiviral therapy, were investigated for the presence of TTV and SENV. Results: The Ishak score determined from 107 liver biopsy samples compared according to TTV or SENV coinfection was similar. Among 39 chronic hepatitis C patients with and 43 without virological response, we have found 9 and 3 SENV positive (p<0.05) and 18 and 28 TTV positive patients, respectively (not significant). However 11 of 32 biopsy samples obtained in the responder's group and 19 of 31 in non-responders were TTV positive (p<0.05). No similar differences were observed among 23 chronic hepatitis B patients. TTV clearance after interferon therapy exceeded 80 %, clearance of SENV 90 %. Conclusion: TTV or SENV infections did not negatively influence the severity of histological features or the antiviral response in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C. Both viruses were highly sensitive to interferon therapy.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are small, non-enveloped viruses with a circular single-stranded DNA genome, belonging to the family Anelloviridae. In swine, two genetically distinct species have been identified, Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2). The aim of the present work was to study the tissue distribution of TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 in pigs of different ages, including foetuses at the second and last thirds of gestation, and animals at 5 days and 5, 15 and 24 weeks of age. Investigated tissues included brain, lung, mediastinal and mesenteric lymph nodes, heart, liver, spleen, kidney and bone marrow. Viral DNA from tissue extractions were tested by a comparative PCR for the presence of TTSuVs. Overall, TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 species were found in all tissues tested, with variations depending on age, and following similar infection dynamics in all tissues, increasing progressively in prevalence and virus load over time. The highest prevalence was found at 5 weeks of age and maintained afterwards, and the highest loads of virus in the different tissues were seen in the oldest animals (15 and 24 weeks of age). No animals were negative to TTV, including foetuses. In conclusion, the present study indicated that swine TTSuV1 and TTSuV2 can be found virtually in all body tissues of the pig. Both swine TTV species were present in high levels in almost all older animals, while viral negative tissues were only found in 5-week-old and 5-day-old pigs, and foetuses. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (TTV), a single-stranded circular DNA virus, has been incriminated in swine diseases recently. Multiple infection with porcine TTV species 1 (PTTV1) and species 2 (PTTV2), each consisting of two types (PTTV1a and 1b) or subtypes (PTTV2b and 2c), in a single pig had been reported by our group previously. The present study described three novel assays for quantitation and differential detection of porcine TTV. First, we developed two SYBR green-based real-time PCR assays to quantify viral loads of two porcine TTV species, respectively. The PTTV1- and PTTV2-specific real-time PCR primer sequences were selected to target conserved regions identified by multiple alignments of ten available porcine TTV full-length genomes. Furthermore, by coupling the two singleplex PCR assays, a duplex real-time PCR assay followed by melting curve analysis was established for simultaneous detection and differentiation of PTTV1 and PTTV2. In addition, a type-specific duplex nested PCR was also developed to simultaneously detect and distinguish between the two types, PTTV1a and 1b, in PTTV1 species. These assays provide rapid and practical tools for molecular diagnosis of species- or type-specific porcine TTV. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study describes the prevalence and association of Torque teno virus (TTV) infection with blood-transmitted viral hepatitis including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). TTV infection was diagnosed by detection of TTV-DNA in serum, using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. TTV-DNA was estimated in a total number of one hundred patients with CRF and in 100 voluntary blood donors as controls. The markers of HBV and HCV were also tested in sera samples of these patients. TTV-DNA was detected in 39 of 100 patients (39%) with CRF and in 27 of 100 (27%) healthy controls. The analysis of the results demonstrated HBsAg, IgM anti-HBc, anti-HCV, and HCV core antigen in 5.0, 3.0, 6.0, and 4.0% of patients, respectively. This study could not show any association of TTV with HBV and HCV infections for the transmission pattern or any impact on severity of diseases caused by these viruses in CRF patients. TTV also could not show any association with demographic characteristics of patients, duration of dialysis, number of blood transfusions and renal/liver function of the patients. As such, this study concludes that TTV appears as a benign pathogen, showing no sign of renal/liver damage or any change in the severity of diseases caused by blood-borne hepatitis viruses. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - For over one hundred years, indicator organisms such as coliforms have been measured as an index of public health risk from transmission of waterborne diseases. However, outbreaks have occurred in systems with negative coliform results, and no discernable public health outcomes have resulted as a consequence of positive results. The lack of correlation between coliforms and disease outcomes demonstrates the limitations of coliform indicators. In particular, coliforms respond differently to environmental stressors and to engineered treatment processes than viral pathogens. A viral indicator may be more appropriate to indicate the health risks of infectious viruses. Torque Teno virus (TTV) is a potential indicator for viral pathogens. It is a small, unenveloped ssDNA virus that was first discovered in 1997. TTV occurs worldwide in humans, occurs in different serotypes between non-human animals and humans, does not appear to be associated with any significant morbidity, and appears to exhibit similar transport characteristics as pathogenic enteric viruses. This research is aimed at assessing the utility of TTV as an appropriate viral pathogen indicator in drinking water sources. This presentation will detail the development of the TTV assay, and compare assay results to prior work utilizing similar and different protocols. The overall objective is to develop a new, reliable, efficient indicator system for viral pathogen risk. 2010 © American Water Works Association WQTC Conference Proceedings All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a disease of unknown origin and progression that primarily affects older adults. Accumulating clinical and experimental evidence suggests that viral infections may play a role, either as agents that predispose the lung to fibrosis or exacerbate existing fibrosis. In particular, herpesviruses have been linked with IPF. This article summarizes the evidence for and against viral cofactors in IPF pathogenesis. In addition, we review mechanistic studies in animal models that highlight the fibrotic potential of viral infection, and explore the different mechanisms that might be responsible. We also review early evidence to suggest that the aged lung may be particularly susceptible to viral-induced fibrosis and make recommendations for future research directions. © 2010 Expert Reviews Ltd.

AB  - Background: Anellovirus species Torque teno virus (TTV), Torque teno mini virus (TTMV), and Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV) and flavivirus GBV-C are highly prevalent and genetically diverse chronic human viral infections that have not yet been associated with disease. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine if these commensal viruses are transmitted by blood transfusions, we genetically analyzed viral species in cryopreserved samples from blood donors and corresponding pre-and posttransfusion samples from recipients enrolled in the Transfusion-Transmitted Viruses Study cohort. RESULTS: All 24 individuals in 12 donor-recipient pairs were infected with TTV, while 16 were infected with TTMV, 15 with TTMDV, and four with GBV-C. None of the 12 informative cases of TTV transfusion or eight cases of TTMV transfusion, where the donor and recipient viruses could be genetically differentiated, resulted in detectable transmissions in which the donor viruses were detected in the recipient by direct sequencing of the polymerase chain reaction products. Of the five informative cases of TTMDV transfusion, including two cases of transfusion into TTMDV-negative recipients, one case of superinfection was seen with both the recipient and the donor viral variants detected in the transfusion recipient for at least 11 days posttransfusion. Three donor-recipient pairs were informative for GBV-C transmission with only one transfusion into a GBV-C-negative recipient resulting in a transiently detected infection. CONCLUSIONS: Transmission of the common commensal anelloviruses and GBV-C during transfusion was detected in 2 of 12 already infected or uninfected recipients. Underestimation of the true rate of viral transmission may be due to limitations in detecting donor viral variants present as minority variants in the already infected transfusion recipients. © 2010 American Association of Blood Banks.

Many aspects of the natural history and pathogenesis of these under many respects surprising viruses are still poorly understood. In this review, we briefly outline the general properties of anelloviruses, examine what is currently known about the interactions they establish with the central nervous system (CNS), and discuss the possible pathological consequences. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are the most recently recognized causes of infectious hepatitis of pigs and may or may not act independently in the development of the disease. Recently it has been suggested that swine torque teno viruses (TTVs), in co-infections with some swine viral pathogens, may potentiate the severity of disease. In order to search for virological cofactors associated with infectious hepatitis in pigs, we investigated the liver tissues, to determine the presence of TTVs, PCV2 and HEV of naturally infected pigs and analysed the prevalence of both genogroups of the TTVs in the hepatitis lesions. Histopathological techniques, nested-polymerase chain reactions (nPCRs), polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and one-step reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) were applied to detect hepatitis lesions, TTVs genogroups 1 and 2, PCV2 and HEV infection. Of the livers examined 58% (29/50) had mild to moderate hepatitis and 74% (37/50), 56% (28/50) and 26% (13/50) samples were nPCR, PCR and RT-PCR positive for TTVs PCV2 and HEV respectively. TTVs were detected in 84% (16/19) of the samples which were determined to be of mild severity while present in almost all (90% or 9/10) samples identified as having moderate hepatitis lesions. Additionally, the livers of 12 out of 21 (57%) pigs without the hepatitis lesions were positive for TTVs. These results demonstrate an association between TTVs and infectious hepatitis of pigs in concomitant infections with PCV2 and/or HEV and indicated that TTVs may play a role as a cofactor in the pathogenesis of disease. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Infections are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Survival rates for SLE patients in developing countries are comparatively lower than those reported in industrialized countries, with early death from infection and active disease. In addition to the role of immunosuppressive agents in enhancing susceptibility to infection, infectious agents are also known to trigger lupus disease expression and activity. The endemicity of certain infections like tuberculosis further poses a special health issue in developing countries. © 2010 The Author(s).

AB  - MS is an immune mediated disease of the central nervous system (CNS) characterized by demyelination, axonal damage and neurologic disability. The primary cause of this CNS disease remains elusive. Here we will address our current understanding of the role of viruses as potential environmental triggers for MS. Virus infections can act peripherally (outside the CNS) or within the CNS. The association of viral infections with demyelinating disease, in both animals and humans, will be discussed, as will the potential contributions of peripheral infection with Torque Teno virus, infection outside of and/or within the CNS with Epstein-Barr virus and infection within the CNS with Human Herpesvirus 6 to MS. An experimental animal model, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus infection of susceptible strains of mice is an example of viral infections of the CNS as a prerequisite for demyelination. Finally, the proposition that multiple virus infections are required, which first prime the immune system and then trigger the disease, as a model where infections outside of the CNS lead to inflammatory changes within the CNS, for the development of a MS-like disease is explored. © 2009 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - In a previous study, using random amplification and large-scale sequencing technology, we identified a novel porcine parvovirus belonging to the genus Bocavirus in the background of porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) in Swedish pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). In addition to bocavirus we demonstrated the presence of torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2 in these cases of PMWS, indicating the simultaneous presence of several viruses in this disease complex. In the present study, 34 PMWS-affected animals and 24 pigs without PMWS were screened by PCR for the presence of PCV-2, TTV-1, TTV-2 and porcine boca-like virus (Pbo-likeV). The studies revealed the following infection rates in the PMWS-affected pigs: PCV-2 100%, TTV-1 77%, TTV-2 94% and Pbo-likeV 88%. In comparison, the pigs without PMWS had the following rates: PCV-2 80%, TTV-1 79%, TTV-2 83% and Pbo-likeV 46%. The sequence identity between the different Swedish Pbo-likeV sequences ranged between 98% and 100%. By checking co-infection, it was found that 71% of the PMWS-affected pigs harbor simultaneously all these viruses. As a contrast, in the group without PMWS only 33% of the animals were positive simultaneously for these viruses. These observations indicate a multiple viral infection in PMWS-affected pigs. It has to be studied further if the clinical manifestation of PMWS might be due to synergistic effects of different viruses acting together. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to estimate the presence of Torque teno sus virus (TTV) species in pig foetuses in order to assess the possible relationship between swine TTV infection and abortion in swine. A total of 98 abortion cases and foetuses collected from 55 pregnant sows at slaughterhouse were analysed by PCR for the presence of Torque teno sus virus 1 (TTV1) and Torque teno sus virus 2 (TTV2). All foetuses were necropsied and relevant tissues were collected, pooled, and submitted to DNA extraction. The overall prevalence of swine TTV1 and TTV2 in aborted foetuses (n = 98) was 17.0% and 29.6%, respectively. For slaughterhouse collected foetuses (n = 55), 10.9% were TTV1 PCR positive and 40.0% were positive for TTV2. There were no statistically significant differences when comparing prevalence of swine TTVs by type of sample (aborted versus slaughterhouse collected foetuses) or by gestation stage. The present work represents the first description of swine TTV infection in pig foetuses at different stages of gestation. Results obtained confirm that vertical transmission is an important route of TTVs dissemination. In addition, data obtained suggest that swine TTVs should not be considered as infectious agents responsible for abortion occurrence. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome. TTV is currently classified in the unassigned genus Anellovirus, and distinct TTVs of tentative species-status infect a wide range of vertebrates. In domestic pigs and wild boars, porcine TTV occurs in two genogroups, TTV1 and TTV2, which are currently detected using only conventional PCR assays. To allow high-throughput testing, the present study describes development of a multiplex real-time (rt)-PCR assay for efficient simultaneous detection of TTV1 and TTV2. To demonstrate usefulness of this rt-PCR assay for large-scale testing, 203 serum samples from domestic pigs were screened for TTV infection. The detected rates of single TTV1, single TTV2, and double TTV1/TTV2 infections were 32, 17, and 32% and represent the first report on the occurrence of porcine TTV in Germany. In addition, 100 wild boar lung samples were tested that confirmed high prevalences of TTV infection. Moreover, establishment of genogroup-specific rt-PCR standards allowed the determination of mean viral genomic loads in sera from TTV-infected swine to about 104.5/ml, respectively. To verify the specificity of the rt-PCR assay, conventional PCR assays that amplify genogroup-specific, size-distinguishable products from the TTV untranslated regions were designed. In total, 50 clones derived from 24 PCR products obtained from 19 TTV1 and TTV2 single- or double-infected animals were sequenced. Phylogenetic analyses of these sequences demonstrated the frequent occurrence of multiple infections with distinct porcine TTVs of the same genogroup. Moreover, two porcine TTV full-length sequences were established, one for each genogroup. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A 12-year-old Japanese boy suffered from severe acute hepatitis and pancytopenia. The patient underwent successful bone marrow transplantation from an HLA-identical sister. Torque teno virus (TTV) DNA of genotype 1a and IgM-class antibody against the virus were detected in sera at the onset of hepatitis. TTV/1a DNA and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody levels were undetectable on the 16th and 46th days after the onset of illness, respectively. Anti-TTV/1a IgG antibody was positive throughout the observation period. Sequential viral load and anti-TTV/1a IgM antibody suggested a primary infection of TTV/1a. Genomic sequence of the virus coincided with that of the original strain first isolated from human. TTV DNA was quantified at 130 copies in 105 bone marrow mononuclear cells, which suggested that infection of hematopoietic cells might be the cause of aplasia. This is the first report of TTV hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia assessed by the anti-TTV antibodies and viral load in peripheral blood and bone marrow. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Many aspects of the life cycle of torquetenoviruses (TTVs) are essentially unexplored. In particular, it is still a matter of speculation which cell type(s) replicates the viruses and maintains the generally high viral loads found in the blood of infected hosts. In this study, we sequentially measured the TTV loads in the plasma of four TTV-positive leukemia patients who were strongly myelosuppressed and then transplanted with haploidentical hematopoietic stem cells. The findings provide clear quantitative evidence for an extremely important role of hematopoietic cells in the maintenance of TTV viremia. Copyright © 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

AB  - Aims: The goal of this study was to develop and to optimize molecular tools to detect the presence of Torque teno virus (TTV) in swine and cattle. A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a TaqMan probe was developed to detect both genogroups of TTV strains. Methods and Results: Oligonucleotide primers and hybridization probes were designed based on sequence analysis of the noncoding region, a highly conserved part of the genome. The real-time PCR assay specifically detected bovine and porcine TTV DNA without cross-amplification of other common pathogens. The assay was compared with conventional PCR and nested-PCR assays for the detection of porcine genogroups 1 and 2 and bovine TTV on plasma and faecal samples, and the assay was found faster, more reliable and reduced the risk of false positive results. Conclusions: The real-time PCR assay provided better detection results for the two TTV genogroups in both swine and cattle compared to the conventional PCR assays. Significance and Impact of the Study: This new TaqMan PCR assay will be a useful tool for the detection of animal TTV strains, to evaluate the viral load from animal host and finally to identify the presence of these viruses in the agri-food continuum. © 2009 The Society for Applied Microbiology.

AB  - The safety of veterinary vaccines is of paramount importance and it is significantly jeopardised by extraneous agents such as bacteria, mycoplasma, Chlamydia and viruses. Several critical steps of vaccine manufacture involve a potential risk of viral contamination. Viruses, as extraneous, agents can be divided into two main groups. Group 1 agents, such as Pestivirus, chicken anaemia virus (CAV), and egg drop syndrome virus (EDSV) are well-known to manufacturers and authorities. Compendial detection methods, clear guidelines and legislation have been established to minimise the risk of contamination with these agents. Contrary to group 1, group 2 agents like Torque Teno virus (TTV) or RD114, a replication-competent feline γ-retrovirus, have only recently been recognised and their role as contaminants needs further investigation. Randomly selected veterinary vaccines used between 1992 and 2009 were tested by nucleic acid amplification for CAV, EDSV, and TTV. Pestivirus contamination was examined in 33 vaccines used between 1996 and 2006 and a further 27 vaccines used between 2007 and 2009 based on random selection of these vaccines. In addition to random tests done on vaccines used from 2007 on, 12 batches of live Aujeszky's disease vaccines submitted to our laboratory for Official Control Authority Batch Release (OCABR) were also tested for Pestivirus. © 2010 The International Association for Biologicals.

AB  - APOBEC3 proteins function as part of innate antiviral immunity and induce G to A hypermutation in retroviruses and hepatitis B virus (HBV) genomes. Whether APOBEC3 proteins affect viruses that replicate without a reverse transcription step is unknown. TT virus (TTV), known to present in serum of healthy individuals and HBV carriers, has a single-stranded circular DNA genome and replicates without reverse transcription. In this study, we examined 67 blood samples obtained from healthy individuals and HBV carriers and observed G to A hypermutation of genomes of TTV in both healthy individuals and HBV carriers. During ALT flare-up in HBV carriers, G to A hypermutation of HBV increased, but TTV genomes significantly decreased in number and hypermutated TTV genomes became undetectable. Our results show that hypermutated TTV exist in healthy individuals and HBV carriers and that TTV genomes were susceptible to immune reaction directed to HBV by interacting with APOBEC3 proteins. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus resides in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and replicates when these cells get activated. The TTV replication shifts the immunobalance. Aim: To determine the presence of TTV in the gingiva of patients with aggressive periodontitis, patients with chronic periodontitis, and healthy controls, and to correlate the presence of TTV with probing pocket depth and clinical attachment level. Methods: Forty-two subjects (22 males and 20 females) aged 21 to 55 years were recruited for this study. Subjects were stratified into aggressive periodontitis (Group I), chronic periodontitis (Group II) and healthy controls (Group III). Gingival tissue biopsy was taken from all the subjects and the presence of TTV was analyzed using PCR and 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Results: TTV was identified in half of the subjects and more number of subjects with periodontitis have TT virus compared to controls. There was significant association between presence of TT virus and pocket depth, clinical attachment level. Conclusions: The findings from the present study shows that there was no significant association between TT virus and periodontitis, even though it was isolated from more number of subjects with aggressive periodontitis, and TTV was associated with pocket depth and clinical attachment level. These findings need to be investigated in further studies.

AB  - This article is a review of recently published papers dealing with the possible participation of TT viruses in the multifactorial etiology of disease syndromes, particularly in postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) of swine. The information concerning the taxonomy of these viruses is presented. The virus strain of this group was demonstrated for the first time in 1997 in a human in Japan and was called TTV in reference to the initials of his name. Recently the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses has established a new meaning of TT, namely Torque teno virus, deriving from the Latin terms "torque" meaning "necklace" and "tenuis" meaning "thin". These terms were chosen to reflect the shape of the TTV genome. TTV was classified to the Anellovirus genus of the Circoviridae family. It was stated that there is no evidence of a link between TTV infection of humans and specific diseases. The same was true in relation to infection of cattle, sheep, chickens, dogs, cats and swine infected by other TTV strains, specific in its replication for a particular species of animals. The following text deals particularly with the last mentioned species. Globally TTV infection is widely spread in pigs. Animals, among them pigs, remain infected and even viremic for years without any apparent negative effects. However, in coinfection with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), being the main etiological factor of PMWS, TTV may possibly contribute to the development of the clinical course of the disease. This is more evident in gnotobiotic pigs. In case of an infection exclusively with TTV in gnotobiotic pigs no clinical symptoms occur. However post mortem pathological changes including thymic atrophy, glomerulonephropathy and modest lymphocytic to histiocytic infiltrates in the liver are found. Summarizing, ¿ research concerning the role of TTV in the multifactorial etiology of disease syndromes needs to be continued.

AB  - Background & objectives: TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered non-enveloped, single stranded DNA virus of high genotypic variability, found frequently in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis of non A-G aetiology. This study was carried out to look for the presence of TTV and its genotypes in patients with different types of liver diseases from northern India. Methods: A total of 262 serum samples from patients of acute viral hepatitis (AVH; n=72), fulminant hepatic failure (FHF; n=49), chronic active hepatitis (CAH; n=93) and liver cirrhosis (LC; n=48), were analyzed for hepatitis A-G viral markers. TTV DNA was detected in all cases by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers from N22 and untranslated (UTR) region. TTV-DNA was also tested in 150 volunteer blood donors. Direct nucleotide sequencing of N22 amplicons were carried out to look into the prevalent TTV genotypes. Results: TTV-DNA was detected in 73.6, 59.2, 21.5 and 29.1 per cent cases with AVH, FHF, CAH and cirrhosis, respectively. In AVH and FHF groups, TTV showed co-infection with all A-G hepatitis cases whereas in CAH and cirrhosis groups, TTV co-infection observed with HBV, HCV and HGV. TTV-DNA was detected in 45.3 per cent volunteer blood donors. No statistically significant difference was observed amongst the mean liver function profile of UTR PCR positive and negative cases in different liver disease groups except AVH cases, in whom the various biochemical parameters between TTV positive and TTV negative patients were marginally significant. However, no significant evidence of biochemical or histological deterioration of the liver was observed in TTV positive cases amongst FHF, CAH and cirrhosis. Predominance of genotype 1a was observed in all the cases from north India. Interpretation & conclusions: TTV is a frequent virus isolated from patients with various types of liver diseases as well as in healthy individuals from northern India. TTV has no effect on biochemical markers of associated liver diseases. Genotype 1a was the most predominant type in different liver disease groups. The occurrence of TTV did not further influence the course of the disease.

AB  - West Nile virus (WNV), a mosquito-borne flavivirus, has increasingly become a concern in both America and Europe due to its complex and unpredictable lifecycle. Transfusion-associated transmission of the WNV has been well documented during the last few years. This study aimed to detect the presence of WNV in: (i) cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens derived from aseptic meningitis cases in Greece and (ii) Greek blood donations. A total of 115 CSF specimens from patients suffering from aseptic meningitis and 9590 blood samples were collected from seven Greek hospitals during the periods June to October 2006 and 2007 and tested for investigational purposes. Both blood and CSF samples were tested for the presence of WNV RNA by using the PROCLEIX WNV assay. None of 115 CSF and 9590 blood donor samples was found positive according to our testing algorithms. Despite the presence of WNV in Balkan countries, WNV has not reached significant levels in Greece. © 2009 British Blood Transfusion Society.

AB  - Infectious agents have long been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus. Common viruses, such as the Epstein-Barr virus, transfusion transmitted virus, parvovirus and cytomegalovirus, have an increased prevalence in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. They may contribute to disease pathogenesis through triggering autoimmunity via structural or functional molecular mimicry, encoding proteins that induce cross-reactive immune responses to self antigens or modulate antigen processing, activation, or apoptosis of B and T cells, macrophages or dendritic cells. Alternatively, some infectious agents, such as malaria, Toxoplasma gondii and Helicobacter pylori, may have a protective effect. Vaccinations may play dual roles by protecting against friend and foe alike. © 2010 Future Medicine Ltd.

AB  - Background: It is common experience that retreating patients too early after a course of intensive chemotherapy predisposes to opportunistic infections despite apparently normal lymphocyte levels. Objectives: The extent of replication of persistent viruses that cause no obvious disease (and hence need no treatment) might better define when a patient has recovered from functional immune deficiency. Study design: We used real-time polymerase chain reaction to monitor the kinetics of plasma torquetenovirus (TTV) viremia in hematological patients undergoing autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation as support to high-dose chemotherapy (HSCT). Results: Independently from underlying hematological disease and therapeutic regimen, TTV viremia increased post-HSCT, and this increase paralleled the increase of circulating CD8+CD57+ T lymphocytes, known to represent an indirect marker of functional immune deficiency. Subsequently, within a matter of months, TTV levels returned to baseline values, at a pace that appeared to be constant over time. Conclusion: Monitoring of TTV viremia represents a unique opportunity to follow functional immune reconstitution in immunosuppressed patients. Also, the size of the TTV viremia increases resulting from immunosuppressive treatments might be of guidance in determining the appropriate time interval before delivery of a next course of therapy. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Porcine Torque teno virus (PTTV) was recently shown to partially contribute to the experimental induction of porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in pigs in the United States. We report here the identification of four distinct full-length genomic sequences of PTTV strains from a single pig in Virginia. Detailed analyses of the genomic organization, the degree of variability and the characteristics of conserved nucleotide and amino acid motifs of PTTV were conducted. The results showed that these four prototype U.S. strains of PTTV identified from the same pig represent distinct genotypes or subtypes and a revised classification system for PPTV is subsequently proposed. This is the first study documenting multiple PTTV infections with distinct genotypes or subtypes in a single pig. The identification of novel PTTV strains from pigs in the United States also pave the way for future disease characterization and genotyping of PTTV. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently identified virus that has a wide range of host tropisms from humans to shrews. Human TTV and Torque teno mini virus are distributed worldwide, and their high prevalence in human populations has been reported. Pigs have their own species-specific TTV, and like human TTV, a high prevalence of porcine TTV also has been reported. Despite its high prevalence, the role of TTV-related disease or syndrome in humans and pigs has not been determined. In the swine industry, TTV is thought to be one of the agents that aggravate clinical manifestation of Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), a newly emerging, economically devastating disease. The purpose of the current study was to quantify TTV viral load in serum obtained from Porcine circovirus-2-negative pigs and PCVAD-affected pigs with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays and to compare TTV viral load between these groups. Results of this study indicate that there are no statically remarkable differences in TTV viral load between the 2 groups, which indicates that TTV might not be an agent of aggravation in PCVAD.

AB  - The prevalence of DNA viruses in water from the Tamagawa River, Japan was quantitatively surveyed for 6 months, from April to September 2003. A total of 18 river water samples were subjected to virus concentration method using an electronegative membrane, followed by DNA extraction and direct quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) for DNA viruses. Adenoviruses of serotypes 40 and 41 were detected most frequently in the river water samples tested (61.1%), at a concentration ranging from 3.16 × 103 to 1.38 × 105 copies/l, followed by JC polyomaviruses (11.1%) and torque teno viruses (5.6%). No sample was positive for BK polyomaviruses. In addition, for selective detection of virus particles, adenoviruses 40 and 41 were tested with qPCR combined with an immunomagnetic separation technique; they were detected in only 16.7% of the samples, showing a concentration ranging from 7.42 × 102 to 4.24 × 104 copies/l. This study is significant since it is the first study to demonstrate the prevalence of polyomaviruses in water samples in Japan and to use immunomagnetic separation qPCR to detect adenovirus particles in aquatic environments. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Since the identification of the prototype TTV in 1997, the diversity of members belonging to the family Anelloviridae identified in human and some animal species kept on increasing. At the same time, data regarding their natural history remain relatively limited. These viruses exhibit an extreme genetic diversity and a high prevalence in various populations, progressively demonstrated by the characterisation of full-length genomes and the optimisation of detection systems. Such unusual properties made the various studies intended to elucidate the implication of Anelloviridae in host's health difficult to develop, their biology being still poorly understood in absence of a robust culture system. These viruses have been identified in the blood and in multiple biological locations; they are probably remarkable examples of co-existence and co-evolution with their human and animal hosts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: SEN virus is a blood-borne, circular ssDNA virus and possessing nine genotypes (A to I). Among nine genotypes, SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes have the strong link with patients with unknown (none-A to E) hepatitis infections. Infection with blood-borne viruses is the second important cause of death in thalassemic patients. The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of SENV-D and SENV-H genotypes viremia by performing nested-PCR in 120 and 100 sera from healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients in Guilan Province, North of Iran respectively. Also, to explicate a possible role of SEN virus in liver disease and established changes in blood factors, the serum aminotransferases (ALT and AST) and some of the blood factors were measured. RESULTS: Frequency of SENV-D, SENV (SENV-H or SENV-D) and co-infection (both SENV-D and SENV-H) viremia was significantly higher among thalassemic patients than healthy individuals. Frequency of SENV-H viremia was significantly higher than SENV-D among healthy individuals. In comparison to SENV-D negative patients, the mean of mean corpuscular hemoglobin was significantly higher in SENV-D positive and co-infection cases (P < 0.05). The means of AST and ALT were significantly higher in thalassemic patients than healthy blood donors, but there were not any significant differences in the means of the liver levels between SENV-positive and -negative individuals in healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients. High nucleotide homology observed among PCR amplicon's sequences in healthy blood donors and thalassemic patients. CONCLUSIONS: The high rate of co-infection shows that different genotypes of SENV have no negative effects on each other. The high frequency of SENV infection among thalassemic patients suggests blood transfusion as main route of transmission. High frequency of SENV infection in healthy individuals indicates that other routes rather than blood transfusion also are important. Frequency of 90.8% of SENV infection among healthy blood donors as well as high nucleotide homology of sequenced amplicons between two groups can probably suggest that healthy blood donors infected by SENV act partly as a source of SENV transmission to the thalassemic patients. In conclusion, SENV-D isolate in Guilan Province may be having a pathogenic agent for thalassemic patients.

AB  - To investigate the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) co-infection in cervical smears of patients with cervical lesions in littoral of Zhejiang province and analysis of transmitted route. Nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) was established. TTV DNA were tested by nPCR in cervical smears of 95 patients with cervical lesions and 55 healthy women, paired serum samples were available from 55 and 42 women, and their viral titer. The genotypes of 95 specimens of cervical cytology were detected with HybriMax. The phylogenetic group of TTV was determined by means of nPCR with N22 primers. The prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears of patients with cervical lesions and healthy women was 52.7% (29/55) and was comparable with that in paired serum sample (50%). Symptomatic women had significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears (74.7%) than healthy controls (P = 0.005). The TTV DNA prevalence in patient serum samples was 51%. The phylogenetic groups of TTV serum isolates were concordant with those of TTV from cervical smears of the same subjects, and genotype was G1b. The TTV viral titer in cervical smears were 10 to 1000 times as high as in serum. The total infection rate of HPV was 98.9% in patients, and was 27.3% in healthy women. The frequently detected genotype was HPV16, 18, 33 of HSIL, and HPV6 of LSIL. The HPV positive study subjects had significantly higher TTV DNA prevalence than HPV negatives (P = 0.02). High prevalence of TTV in cervical smears suggests that sexual transmission is another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the population. The higher viral titer in cervical smears than in the respective serum samples might indicate active TTV replication in the female genital tract. Nevertheless, cooperation between TTV and HPV needs to be further investigated.

AB  - Blood screening by NAT for major transfusion transmitted viral infections (TTIs) was originally intended to complement serology for detection of infected donations. Reports from developed countries showed limited marginal value to NAT blood screening in improving blood safety. Reports on NAT results from Europe indicated yield of 1:0.6 million donations for HBV, <1:M for HCV and HIV-1-related to low prevalence of TTI. In contrast, prevalence of TTI in resource-limited countries is almost always high. As a result, more incident cases can be expected among first-time blood donors. Most reports of NAT blood donation screening in these countries showed NAT confirmed yield as high as 1/2800 for HBV and 1/3100 blood donations for HCV as reported from Thailand and Egypt, respectively. The issues for low resource countries are mostly the high cost of NAT but also the requirements of staff qualification, adequate facilities, reagent procurement and maintenance of delicate equipment. Alternatives to commercial NAT are the use of combos antigen-antibody for HIV and HCV, anti-HBc for HBV and in-house NAT. Most of these alternatives have been reported but very few comparisons are available. Once yield data is available, models for estimation of feasibility and cost-effectiveness are proposed to help decision-making. © 2009 The International Association for Biologicals.

AB  - Measuring trace levels of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in indoor environments is important for the characterization of occupant exposures. The ability to quickly collect air samples at relatively low costs per sample can increase the number of samples that can be collected and thus improve the overall assessment of potential exposures. The specific goal of this paper is to evaluate the accuracy and precision of evacuated glass bottle air samplers (Entech Bottle-Vacs) to collect representative VOC samples at part-per-billion concentrations in indoor environments. Laboratory generated data are also included to validate the precision and accuracy of the method. Multiple Bottle-Vacs in 10 residences in northern New York over 18 different sampling periods were used to collect whole-air VOC samples. Percent relative standard deviations ranged from 1.2 to 20.3% with a median of 8.8% for the 21 compounds analyzed in each Bottle-Vac. Two sampling techniques were used: around the valve (ATV) and through the valve (TTV). Linear regressions of ATV and TTV sample collection into the Bottle-Vacs show that these two sampling techniques are reproducible. Paired t test results show that ATV sampling is more reproducible than TTV; ATV paired samples were statistically the same 100% of the time whereas TTV paired samples were statistically the same 76.9% of the time. ATV sampling of low-level VOCs in indoor built environments is a reproducible chemical sampling technique that could be used by building occupants as a quick and inexpensive means of area sampling.

AB  - Hemovigilance like quality systems and audits has become an integral part of the Blood Transfusion Service (BTS) in the developed world and has contributed greatly to the development of the blood service. However developing countries are still grappling with donor recruitment and efforts towards sufficiency and safety of the blood supply. In these countries the BTS is generally fragmented and a national hemovigilance program would be difficult to implement. However a few developing countries have an effective and sustainable blood program that can deliver equitable, safe and sufficient blood supply to the nation. Different models of hemovigilance program have been introduced with variable success. There are deficiencies but the data collected provided important information that can be presented to the health authorities for effective interventions. Hemovigilance program modeled from developed countries require expertise and resources that are not available in many developing countries. Whatever resources that are available should be utilized to correct deficiencies that are already apparent and obvious. Besides there are other tools that can be used to monitor the blood program in the developing countries depending on the need and the resources available. More importantly the data collected should be accurate and are used and taken into consideration in formulating guidelines, standards and policies and to affect appropriate interventions. Any surveillance program should be introduced in a stepwise manner as the blood transfusion service develops. © 2009 The International Association for Biologicals.

AB  - Background and purpose: SEN virus (SENV) is assumed to be responsible for post-transfusion non-A to -E hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis of SENV has shown 9 different strains. Two strains, SENV-H and SENV-D, were described as possible candidates for post-transfusion hepatitis. This study examined the prevalence of SENV infection and its clinical importance for patients undergoing hemodialysis. Methods: Serum samples were obtained from 63 long-term hemodialysis patients, and examined for SENV-H and SENV-D viremia by polymerase chain reaction. Serum samples were also obtained from 20 patients with chronic kidney diseases (CKD) who were not undergoing hemodialysis and from 20 apparently healthy blood donors to act as controls. For SENV screening, a primer pair was used for the conserved ORF1 region among all SENV genotypes from A to I. Results: SENV infection was significantly more frequent among hemodialysis patients (33/63; 52.4%) and those with CKD (10/20; 50.0%) than among the control participants (2/20; 10.0%) [p = 0.003]. Twenty three of 33 hemodialysis patients had SENV-H or -D, 61% of whom were positive for SENV-H only, 4% were positive for SENV-D only, and 36% were positive for both SENV-H and SENV-D. SENV infection was not associated with age, sex, amount or duration of hemodialysis, or liver function test results. Elevated alanine aminotransferase was significantly associated with HCV viremia, but not with SENV infection. Conclusions: Egyptian hemodialysis patients and those with CKD are at higher risk for SENV transmission. SENV-H is more prevalent than SENV-D. © 2009 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

AB  - Background: Risks of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs), transfusion-associated sepsis (TAS), and transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) were compared between pooled whole blood-derived (PWBD) and single-donor platelets (PLTs) transfused in the United States. Study Design and Methods: The literature was searched for estimates of the risk of TTIs and TAS and of the effect on bacterial contamination of PLTs of process improvements, bacterial culture, and surrogate methods to detect bacteria. Seven studies published between January 2005 and December 2008 and comparing bacterial contamination frequency between PWBD and single-donor PLTs after implementing bacterial culture testing of both components were subjected to meta-analysis. The three retrieved studies diagnosing TRALI based on the 2004 consensus definition in settings transfusing both PWBD and single-donor PLTs were not amenable to meta-analysis and were assessed qualitatively. Results: Under a best-case scenario, if 100% (from the current 12.5%) of PLT doses were provided as PWBD PLTs, the number of additional transmissions of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, bacteria, or a novel pathogen annually could be 1.2, 1.3, 9.0, 105.3, or 69.2 to 252.6, respectively. Compared with single-donor PLTs, US PLT pools of five concentrates have a 5.6-fold higher risk of bacterial contamination (summary odds ratio, 5.58; 95% confidence interval, 2.60-11.98; p < 0.05). The three studies that diagnosed TRALI based on the consensus definition did not demonstrate a difference in risk between PWBD and single-donor PLTs. Conclusions: TTIs and TAS determine the relative safety of PWBD versus single-donor PLTs. The available limited data do not support a higher risk of TRALI from single-donor (compared with PWBD) PLTs. © 2009 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - Active infection with torquetenovirus (TTV) has been associated with an increased severity of diseases in which inflammation plays a particularly important pathogenetic role. Here, we report that cloned DNA of a genogroup 4 TTV (ViPiSAL) is an activator of proinflammatory cytokine production by murine spleen cells and that the effect is mediated via toll-like receptor (TLR)9. The same DNA also increased the levels of proinflammatory cytokines induced by two well-characterized TLR9 stimulants. Finally, in silico analyses of the genomes of ViPiSAL and other TTVs revealed marked differences in the representation of CpG motifs known to be most effective at activating immune cells via TLR9. These findings demonstrate for the first time that at least one TTV isolate has the potential to stimulate and co-stimulate inflammatory responses. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) was first isolated from a human hepatitis patient in 1997. TTV was also identified in several animals, including pigs, cattle, sheep, cats and dogs. In this study, we analysed the prevalence of swine TTV genogroups 1 (TTV1) and 2 (TTV2) in Japanese swine populations with suspected post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome and porcine respiratory disease by using a nested polymerase chain reaction method. Of 153 serum samples from 16 different herds in Japan, TTV1 was detected in 46 samples (30%), TTV2 in 47 samples (31%) and both in 15 samples (10%). There was no significant difference in the detection rate among geographical regions. The overall prevalence rate of TTV genogroups was significantly lower in ≤30-day-old pigs (11%) compared to that in older age groups (54-82%). These results suggest that swine TTV may be widespread in post-weaning pigs and could play aetiological roles in pig diseases in Japan. This is the first report on the prevalence of swine TTV in Japan. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) virus infecting human and non-primate species. Two genogroups of TTV (TTV1 and TTV2) have been described in swine so far. In the present study, TTV1 and TTV2 prevalences in serum, and nasal as well as rectal swabs of 55 randomly selected piglets from seven Spanish multi-site farms, were monitored from 1 to 15 weeks of age. Also, blood from their dams (n = 41) were taken at 1 week post-farrowing. Samples were tested by means of two TTV genogroup specific PCRs. Although prevalence of TTV1 and TTV2 in sows was relatively high (54% and 32%, respectively), it was not directly associated to their prevalence in the offspring. Percentage of viremic pigs for both TTV genogroups followed similar dynamics, increasing progressively over time, with the highest rate of detection at 11 weeks of age for TTV1 and at 15 weeks for TTV2. Forty-two (76%) and 33 (60%) of the 55 studied pigs were TTV1 and TTV2 PCR positive in serum, respectively, in more than one sampling time. TTV1 and TTV2 viremia lasted in a number of animals up to 15 and 8 weeks, respectively. Co-infection with both TTV genogroups in serum was detected at all sampling points, but at 1 week of age. On the contrary, there were animals PCR negative to both genogroups in serum at all sampling times but at 15 weeks of age. During the study period, TTV1 and TTV2 nasal shedding increased also over time and faecal excretion was intermittent and of low percentage (<20%). In conclusion, the present study describes for the first time the infection dynamics of TTV1 and TTV2 as well as the nasal and faecal excretion throughout the life of pigs from conventional, multi-site farms. Moreover, results indicate that both swine TTV genogroups are able to establish persistent infections in a number of pigs. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Environmental factors are capable of triggering the expression of human endogenous retroviruses and induce an autoimmune response. Infection can promote the expression of human endogenous retroviruses by molecular mimicry or by functional mimicry. There are additional mechanisms which may control the expression of human endogenous retroviruses, such as epigenetic status of the genome (hypomethylation, histone deacetylation). Ultraviolet exposure, chemicals/drugs, injury/stress, hormones, all as a single cause or in a concert, may modulate the involvement of human endogenous retroviruses in pathogenic processes. In the current review we summarize the current knowledge on infections, molecular mimicry, cross-reactivity and epigenetics contribution for trigger human endogenous retroviruses expression and pathogenesis in lupus patients.

AB  - In a previous pilot study, a significantly poorer outcome of laryngeal cancer was found in patients co-infected with human papillomavirus (HPV) and genogroup 1 torque tenovirus (TTV). The present study aimed to collect data on the overall prevalence of TTVs on the prevalence of genogroup 1 TTV in two other malignancies associated with HPV, oral squamous cell cancer and cervical cancer, and in oral and cervical premalignant lesions (oral lichen planus, oral leukoplakia, cervical atypia). Oral samples from all patients were accompanied with a sample from the healthy mucosa. The overall prevalence of TTV was significantly higher both in oral squamous cell cancer and cervical cancer compared with other patient groups or with the respective controls. The prevalence of genogroup 1 TTV was significantly higher in lesions of oral squamous cell cancer and oral lichen planus, but not in lesions of oral leukoplakia (24.6%, 10.1%, and 4.5%, respectively), compared with the prevalence in the oral cavity of controls (1.4%). Co-infection rates with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV were significantly higher in oral squamous cell cancer than in controls, oral lichen planus or oral leukoplakia patients (12.3%, 0.0%, 6.7%, and 4.5%, respectively). The prevalence of genogroup 1 TTV in all cervical samples were comparable. These data suggest that genogroup 1 TTV may be associated specifically with some head and neck mucosal disorders, but disproves a (co)carcinogenic role inoral canceror cervical cancer aswell as an association with HPV or with malignancies associated with HPV. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background. Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular, single-stranded DNA virus that chronically infects healthy individuals of all ages worldwide. There is a lot of data on the prevalence and genetic heterogeneity of TTV in healthy populations and in patients with various diseases now available. However, little is known about TTV load among healthy human population. In this study we analyzed TTV load in the group of 512 Russian elite athletes, who are supposed to be, by some standards, the healthiest part of the human population. Results. The prevalence rate of TTV among the Russian Olympic Reserve members was 94% (for test sensitivity about 1000 genome equivalents per 1 ml of blood). Quantities varied from 103 (which corresponded to detection limit) to 1010 copies per 1 ml of blood, with median at 2.7 × 10 6 copies. Conclusion. About 94% of healthy individuals in Russian population have more than 1000 TTV genome copies per 1 ml of blood. This result exceeds the previously published data, and can be explained by either more sensitive PCR test system or by higher TTV distribution in Russian population or both. TTV viral load neither depends on gender, nor age. © 2009 Vasilyev et al.

AB  - Several viruses can pass the maternal-fetal barrier, and cause diseases of the fetus or the newborn. Recently, however, it became obvious, that viruses may invade fetal cells and organs through different routes without acute consequences. Spermatozoa, seminal fluid and lymphocytes in the sperm may transfer viruses into the human zygotes. Viruses were shown to be integrated into human chromosomes and transferred into fetal tissues. The regular maternal-fetal transport of maternal cells has also been discovered. This transport might implicate that lymphotropic viruses can be released into the fetal organs following cellular invasion. It has been shown that many viruses may replicate in human trophoblasts and syncytiotrophoblast cells thus passing the barrier of the maternal-fetal interface. The transport of viral immunocomplexes had also been suggested, and the possibility has been put forward that even anti-idiotypes mimicking viral epitopes might be transferred by natural mechanisms into the fetal plasma, in spite of the selective mechanisms of apical to basolateral transcytosis in syncytiotrophoblast and basolateral to apical transcytosis in fetal capillary endothelium. The mechanisms of maternal-fetal transcytosis seem to be different of those observed in differentiated cells and tissue cultures. Membrane fusion and lipid rafts of high cholesterol content are probably the main requirements of fetal transcytosis. The long term presence of viruses in fetal tissues and their interactions with the fetal immune system might result in post partum consequences as far as increased risk of the development of malignancies and chronic pathologic conditions are discussed. © 2009 Arányi Lajos Foundation.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are classified into the Anellovirus genus of the Circoviridae family. In addition to TTV isolates, TTV genogroup 3 also includes the 8 virus strains known as SENV-A to H. In this study, the prevalence of TTV group 3 viruses and that of SENV-D and H in particular were determined among the staff of a hospital in Budapest. Viruses were genotyped using type-specific PCR primers and by cloning and sequencing of PCR products. Frequency of infection with TTV group 3 was high among both the hospital staff and the control group. Prevalence of SENV-H was similar in the two groups, but SENV-D infection was significantly more common in the study group than in controls. Sequencing of PCR products showed that viruses closely related to isolate TUS01 are common in Hungary. Several sequences could not be genotyped and may represent a previously undescribed genotype within the genogroup. TTV group 3 sequences detected in the serum samples of a symptomless health care worker were followed-up for 15 years. Some strains persisted for up to 10 years, while others caused transient infections and could be detected in only one of the samples. Results showed that TTV infection, superinfection, and viral clearance often occur over the years without apparent symptoms. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Injecting drug users are at increased risk of infection with hepatitis viruses and blood-borne pathogens. The aim of this study was to examine HBV, HCV, HDV, and TTV infections in Saudi drug users (N=344). Extraction of nucleic acid from serum, reverse-transcription, amplification of viral nucleic acids, and HBV and HCV genotyping were done using established techniques. Of the analyzed samples, 41 (12%) contained detectable HBV DNA, 131 (38%) contained detectable HCV RNA, and 174 (51%) had detectable TTV DNA. The predominant HBV genotype was found to be genotype D and the predominant HCV genotype was found to be genotype 1b. All the samples were negative for HDV. Twelve samples (3.5%) were found to contain mixed HBV and HCV genomes, 24 samples (7%) were found to contain mixed HBV and TTV genomes, 82 samples (24%) were found to contain mixed HCV and TTV genomes, and 9 samples (2.6%) were found to contain mixed HBV, HCV, and TTV genomes. Identification of various infections in drug users will help the control of these infections in this group as well as in the community. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to assess the ability of nanofiltration of albumin solution, prothrombin complex (PTC) and factor IX (FIX) to remove two small, non-enveloped DNA viruses, parvovirus B19 (B19V) and torque teno virus (TTV). Virus removal was investigated with down-scale experiments performed with sequential steps of 35-nm and 15-nm nanofiltrations of products spiked with virus DNA-positive sera. Viral loads were determined by real-time PCRs. The 15-nm nanofiltration removed more than 4.0 B19V log from all the products, TTV was reduced of more than 3.0 log from albumin solution and FIX by 35-nm and 15-nm nanofiltrations, respectively, being viral DNA undetectable after these treatments. Traces of TTV were still found in PTC after the 15-nm nanofiltration. In conclusion, nanofiltration can be efficacious in removing small naked viruses but, since viruses with similar features can differently respond to the treatment, a careful monitoring of large-scale nanofiltration should be performed. © 2009 British Blood Transfusion Society.

AB  - Background: The female lower genital tract is a gateway for pathogens entering the host through the mucous membrane. One of the prevalent human viruses is Torque teno virus (TTV). The major reported routes of TTV transmission are fecal-oral and parenteral. Furthermore, other modes of transmission, e.g. sexual contact, are suggested. To investigate the sexual route of TTV transmission, cervical smears of healthy women and those with cervical lesions were screened for the presence of TTV DNA. Methods: TTV DNA was studied in cervical smears of 95 patients with cervical lesions and 55 healthy women. Paired serum samples were available from 55 and 42 women, respectively. All healthy women had normal cytology while 44 patients had histologically confirmed low-grade lesion (LGL) and 51 high-grade lesion (HGL). TTV DNA was detected with primers specific for the non-coding region. In 40 paired cervical smears and serum samples, the phylogenetic group of TTV isolates was determined. The presence of HPV DNA in cervical smears was detected by means of PCR with MY09/11 primers. Results: The prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears of healthy women was 52.7% and was comparable with that in paired serum samples (50%). Symptomatic women had significantly higher prevalence of TTV DNA in cervical smears (74.7%) than healthy controls. The TTV DNA prevalence in patient serum samples was 51%. The phylogenetic groups of TTV serum isolates were concordant with those of TTV from cervical smears of the same subjects. In cervical smears, a wider variety of TTV isolates was found. The viral loads in cervical smears were 10 to 1000 times as high as in sera. The HPV-positive study subjects had significantly higher TTV DNA prevalence than HPV negatives. The prevalence of TTV was not associated with disease severity. Conclusion: High prevalence of TTV incervical smears suggests that sexual transmission is another mode of expansion of TTV infection among the population. The higher viral load in cervical smears than in the respective serum samples might indicate active TTV replication in the female genital tract. Nevertheless, cooperation between TTV and HPV needs to be further investigated. © 2009 Saláková et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Sera from 15 patients coinfected with TTV and HIV-1, collected before and at two times after introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), were tested for TTV load and the presence of the five highly divergent TTV phylogenetic groups. Seven patients showed a 1-5 log TTV load decrease during HAART, while the others did not show significant variations. A decrease in the number of coinfecting TTV genogroups was detected in 12 of 15 patients, with the mean number of TTV genogroups/patient decreasing from 2.33 before HAART to 1.47 at the last collect. All five genogroups were less frequently found after introduction of HAART. Three hundred sixty-seven TTV clones from four different genogroups, derived from two patients, were sequenced. Noticeable fluctuations in TTV subpopulation frequencies were observed in both patients analyzed. In conclusion, HAART tends to reduce the number of TTV genotypes/genogroups and may affect the balance between different TTV isolates coinfecting single individuals. © Springer-Verlag 2009.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV) was detected for the first time in the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown origin. TTV was subsequently, also found in the serum of blood donors with no history of blood transfusion. In the present study, the percentage of TTV carriers among HIV-infected and noninfected patients was determined. The study was conducted to evaluate CD4 count and HIV viral load in 100 asymptomatic patients infected with HIV-1, 100 symptomatic patients with AIDS, 100 HIV-1 exposed but uninfected individuals and 100 normal healthy blood donors. In this work, the presence of TTV was investigated by nested-PCR. TTV was detected in 6% of normal donors, 12.5% of HIV-infected individuals and 21% of exposed individuals. The presence of TTV was statistically significant in the HIV-exposed individuals (21/100) compared with blood donors (6/100). Odds ratio = 4.16 (95%CI 1.60-10.83). No inter-group relations were found for CD4 and CD8 counts or HIV viral load. In the symptomatic group, patients with TTV presented minor viral load. This work demonstrated that TTV was detected in HIV-exposed individuals and no relation was verified for CD4, CD8 and viral load in the asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV patients. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Sera and selected tissue homogenates collected from gnotobiotic swine never exposed to the environment or other swine tissues were tested for the presence of porcine torque teno virus (TTV) DNAs by nested and non-nested polymerase chain reactions (PCR) using primers specific for the untranslated region of porcine genogroups (g) 1 and 2. Twenty-three of 105 (21.9%) gnotobiotic piglets were g1- and/or g2-TTV DNA positive. Twenty-three of 27 (85.2%) sow sera, collected at the time of Caesarian derivation of the litters contained either or both TTV genogroup DNAs. These data demonstrate that porcine TTV may be transmitted to piglets by the in utero route and that the incidence of fetal infection is high. © 2009.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a single-stranded DNA virus that has been detected in serum of primate and non-primate species including swine. Little information on swine TTV infection and transmission dynamics is nowadays available. The goal of this study was to gain insight into the potential role of the sow in transmitting TTV to piglets and the infection dynamics of both swine TTV genogroups (TTV1 and TTV2) during the lactation period. Serum samples from 44 sows at 1-week post-farrowing and 215 piglets at 1 and 3 weeks of age were tested using TTV1 and TTV2 PCR methods. Sow parity distribution and the number of delivered piglets (liveborn, stillborn and mummified) per each studied sow were recorded. TTV1 was detected in higher percentages than TTV2 in both sows (75% vs. 43%, respectively) and piglets at 1 (17% vs. 7%, respectively) and 3 (32% vs. 12%, respectively) weeks of age. TTV1 and TTV2 co-infections were observed in higher percentages in sows (34%) than in piglets (2% and 4% at 1 and 3 weeks of age, respectively). Detection of swine TTV genogroups in sows was not associated with their detection in piglets. Moreover, there were piglets infected at 1 week of age with a swine TTV genogroup different from the one detected in their dam. The number of sows delivering stillborns and the mean number of stillborns per sow tended to be higher in the TTV2 infected sows; this value was significantly higher when co-infected sows (TTV1 and TTV2) were compared with non-co-infected ones. Old parity sows had a higher percentage of TTV1 infected 1-week-old piglets. Results of the present study showed that the TTV infection occurs early in the production system and that these viruses may be transmitted from sow-to-piglet but also from piglet-to-piglet in farrowing facilities. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Routes of swine torque teno virus (TTV) transmission have been minimally investigated in the pig population. Current knowledge suggests the faecal-oral route as the most probable way of viral dissemination. Other transmission routes, such as mother-to-infant, have been studied in humans, but no information is available for swine. Thus, the objective of the present study was to determine the prevalence of two swine TTV genogroups, TTV1 and TTV2, in colostrum samples (n = 61) and sera samples from sows (n = 10) and stillborn pigs coming from them (n = 30). Colostrum was fractioned into two components, milk whey and cell pellets, and 26 out of 61 milk whey samples and 30 out of 58 cell pellets analyzed contained TTV1 or TTV2 genomes, respectively, detected by specific PCR methods. Six and 3 out of 10 serum samples from sows were positive for TTV1 and TTV2 DNA, respectively. Finally, 15 out of 30 sera from stillborns were PCR positive for TTV1, but only 2 were TTV2 positive. Positive stillborns were always infected with the same TTV genogroup as their mothers. However, TTV sequence analysis determined that sequences obtained from sows and their stillborns were not identical. In conclusion, our results indicated that swine TTVs can be transmitted vertically, and suggest that different sow-to-piglet transmission routes may coexist, including transplacental/intra-uterine as well as through lactation. This study represents the first description of swine TTV presence in colostrum and stillborn piglets. © 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A panel of gastroenteritis outbreak samples was subjected to a virus purification and concentration algorithm followed by a sequence-independent amplification method devised to detect viral enteric pathogens. The application of these methods allowed the identification of torque teno virus (TTV) in one outbreak. The complete genome sequence of 3,260 nt was obtained through "genome walking", and four open reading frames were deduced from the genomic sequence. Phylogenetic analysis grouped this virus in TTV genetic group 3, clustering with genotype 27, with 85% similarity at the nt level with strain SAa-01. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - The discharge of treated civil wastewater into natural waters or their reuse in industry and agricultureinvolves virological risks for the exposed population. Although European and Italian regulations do not require routine viral analysis of treated wastewater, a better understanding of viral contamination and resistance to treatments is needed to assess and control such risks. To this end, a wastewater treatment plant was monitored by analysing the sewage at the plant entry and exit points in order to quantify the initial presence and eventual reduction of adenovirus, Torque Teno virus, Hepatitis A virus, rotavirus, enterovirus, norovirus genogroups I and II, somatic coliphages, Escherichia coli and enterococci. The results reveal that treated water may still contain infectious human viruses and thereby represent a potential health hazard. No significant correlations were found between bacterial indicators and the viruses considered, confirming their inadequacy for virological risk assessment, while the best indicators for virus inactivation in recycled waters seem to be adenovirus, followed by somatic coliphages. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs), of the genus Anellovirus, are single-stranded circular DNA viruses that infect many vertebrate species. Although viruses of this type have quite a stable genome, they exhibit low nucleotide homology. Torque teno virus infection has not been consistently linked to specific diseases, although there is epidemiological evidence of an association with disease in humans. The recent recognition of naturally occurring TTV infection in swine and its epidemiological resemblance to human TTV raises the possibility of using the pig as a model to study human TTV infection. Such an approach will require the development of novel investigative tools to study the epidemiology, transmission, immune responses and potential pathogenesis of TTV infection. The present review summarises research on animal TTV infection, focussing in particular on TTV infection in the pig, and considers how a porcine experimental infection model might assist in the study of human TTV infection. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV), a nonenveloped human virus of the Circoviridae family, is hepatotropic, causing liver damage, cirrhosis, and, rarely, fulminant hepatitis. It prevails in 10% to 75% of blood donors due to environmental differences, independent of chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV)/HCV hepatitis, cryptogenic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, and in fulminant hepatitis non-A-G. Reports about the efficacy of clinical alpha interferon are rare. In July 2007, a 65-year-old man who was serologically negative for A-E viruses presented with acute liver failure due to a ruptured hepatic artery aneurysm and underwent orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT). Immunosuppression was based on cyclosporine and steroids. At postoperative day 20, there was persistent hypertransaminasemia with otherwise normal liver function. A percutaneous hepatic biopsy documented pattern suggestive of a viral etiology. Multiple tests for hepatotropic viruses in the donor and the recipient from the pre- and post-OLT periods remained negative. Only the TTV qualitative test, assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on patient sera, was positive. Immunosuppressive therapy was not changed; no antiviral therapy was undertaken. At 6 months posttransplantation, transaminase levels spontaneously normalized and the clinical situation was unchanged. No complications were observed; the patient is in good clinical condition. No graft rejection was observed. In histologically proven non-A-E viral hepatitis, it is important to consider TTV as an incidental pathogenic agent. It may be useful to extend virological tests to TTV among transplant recipients and donors and to gain further knowledge about this virus. © 2009.

AB  - Humans are frequently infected with three anelloviruses which have circular DNA genomes of 3.6-3.9 kb [Torque teno virus (TTV)], 2.8-2.9 kb [Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) and 3.2 kb [a recently discovered anellovirus named Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV)]. Unexpectedly, human TTMDV DNA was not detectable in any of 74 chimpanzees tested, although all but one tested positive for both human TTV and TTMV DNA. Using universal primers for anelloviruses, novel variants of TTMDV that are phylogenetically clearly separate from human TTMDV were identified from chimpanzees, and over the entire genome, three chimpanzee TTMDV variants differed by 17.9-20.3 % from each other and by 40.4-43.6 % from all 18 reported human TTMDVs. A newly developed PCR assay that uses chimpanzee TTMDV-specific primers revealed the high prevalence of chimpanzee TTMDV in chimpanzees (63/74, 85 %) but low prevalence in humans (1/100). While variants of TTV and TTMV from chimpanzees and humans were phylogenetically interspersed, those of TTMDV were monophyletic for each-species, with sequence diversity of <33 and <20% within the 18 human and three chimpanzee TTMDV variants, respectively. Maximum within-group divergence values for TTV and TTMV were 51 and 57 %, respectively; both of these values were substantially greater than the maximum divergence among TTMDV variants (44 %), consistent with a later evolutionary emergence of TTMDV. However, substantiation of this hypothesis will require further analysis of genetic diversity using an expanded dataset of TTMDV variants in humans and chimpanzees. Similarly, the underlying mechanism of observed infrequent cross-species infection of TTMDV between humans and chimpanzees deserves further analysis. © 2009 SGM.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) are vertebrate infecting, single-stranded circular DNA viruses. Two genetically distinct TTV genogroups (TTV1 and TTV2) infect swine worldwide with high prevalence. Currently, swine TTVs are considered non-pathogenic, although TTV2 has been linked to post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome, a porcine circovirus disease. On the other hand, pig materials are an important source of components used in porcine vaccine manufacturing, human drugs and commercial enzyme products. However, there is little information about the possible existence of extraneous viruses in products containing porcine-derived components. In the present study, 26 commercial swine vaccines, seven human drugs and three enzyme products from porcine origin were tested for the presence of TTV1 and TTV2 genomes by PCR. Four vaccines against Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae were positive for TTV2 by PCR. Three M. hyopneumoniae, one porcine parvovirus and one porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus vaccines were PCR positive for TTV1. One human drug contained TTV1 DNA as well as a trypsin enzyme; a porcine-derived elastase product was positive for both TTV genogroups. These results show that swine TTVs are contaminants not only of swine vaccines but also of human drugs containing porcine components and enzymes for laboratory use. © 2009 SGM.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Potential transmission of zoonotic porcine viruses is a major safety issue in xenotransplantation. This review will first summarize recent studies involving transmission and control of the major concern, porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV). Second, the potential for zoonotic transfer and safety measures required against other viruses of concern will be discussed. RECENT FINDINGS: As studies on PERV genomics continue, distribution of PERV, particularly porcine endogenous retrovirus-C in individual pigs in relation to their ability to transmit PERV in vitro, is becoming clearer. However, further study is required to establish pig lines devoid of problematic copies of PERV. As an extra level of safety, several strategies have been sought, with some success, to reduce PERV infectivity and be used to produce transgenic, PERV-suppressed pigs. Porcine herpesviruses, hepatitis E virus, arenaviruses and an Anellovirus, Torque teno virus, have been highlighted as other viruses of potential risk. SUMMARY: Xenotransplantation is a unique situation in which pathogen monitoring may be required to be more comprehensive than that required for specific pathogen-free sources. With evidence of transmission of novel viruses via allotransplantation, significant attention should be paid to emerging and as yet unknown viruses. © 2009 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - A retrospective study to detect evidence of swine Torque teno virus (TTV) genogroups 1 and 2 infection in sera of pigs from the Spanish livestock between years 1985 and 2005 was carried out by means of PCR. Also, the molecular evolution of TTV genogroups 1 and 2 during the 20-year period studied using a 250-base sequence of the non-coding region of the viral genome was assessed. Both TTV genogroup genomes were found in pig sera from the first year of study. Taking into account the whole study period, 113 out of 162 animals (69.8%) were infected with one or the other genogroup, while 38 out of 162 pigs (23.5%) were co-infected with both genogroups. Moreover, TTV genogroup 2 (90 out of 162, 55.6%) was significantly more prevalent than genogroup 1 (54 out of 162, 33.3%). The non-coding region of swine TTV genome sequenced showed its adequacy as a molecular marker in swine TTV. This study represents the earliest evidence of TTV infection in pigs to date, 14 years before the initial description of this virus. Moreover, this is also the earliest evidence of TTV infection in any species. © 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - To test requirement for apoptin in the replication of chicken anemia virus (CAV), an apoptin-knockout clone, pCAV/Ap(-), was constructed. DNA replication was completely abolished in cells transfected with replicative form of CAV/Ap(-). A reverse mutant competent in apoptin production regained the full level of DNA replication. DNA replication and virus-like particle (VLP) production of CAV/Ap(-) was fully complemented by supplementation of the wild-type apoptin. The virus yield of a point mutant, CAV/ApT108I, was 1/40 that of the wild type, even though its DNA replication level was full. The infectious titer of CAV was fully complemented by supplementing apoptin. Progeny virus was free from reverse mutation for T108I. To localize the domain within apoptin molecule inevitable for CAV replication, apoptin-mutant expressing plasmids, pAp1, pAp2, pAp3, and pAp4, were constructed by deleting amino acids 10-36, 31-59, 59-88 and 80-112, respectively. While Ap1 and Ap2 were preferentially localized in nuclei, Ap3 and Ap4 were mainly present in cytoplasm. Although complementation capacity of Ap3 and Ap4 was 1/10 of the wild type, neither of them completely lost its activity. VP3 of TTV did fully complement the DNA replication and VLP of CAV/Ap(-). These data suggest that apoptin is inevitable not only for DNA replication but also VLP of CAV. The common feature of apoptin and TTV-VP3 presented another evidence for close relatedness of CAV and TTV. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective: A novel DNA virus, transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is identified from the serum of a patient from acute hepatitis non-A-E. Few reports have been published on patients with renal disease. Patients on dialysis were at high risk of blood-borne viral infections and little is known about the prevalence of this virus in dialysis patients. In order to verify the prevalence of infection from TTV in these patients, we have examined the incidence of TTV in Italian patients with dialysis. Methods: Serum samples of 85 patients and 65 healthy individuals were examined. In order to evidence the presence of the TTV virus, a method of the seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with TTV-specific primers derives from the N22 region deIl'ORF-1 of the virus has been used and products were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. All serum samples were also analyzed to markers HBV and HCV. Results: The prevalence of TTV DNA in dialysis patients [35/85 (41,7%)] was significantly higher than in healthy population [7/65 (10,7%)]. Among TTV positive dialysis patients, HCV coinfection was present in six cases. The positivity rate for TTV-DNA tends to increase with age. Conclusion: Transfusion-transmitted virus had a high prevalence in Italian-dialysis patients. In our study the virus did not have an important clinical effect on patients; but remains the possibility that it may aggravate liver disease caused by HCV. However, the question of whether TTV infection might have a possible effect on dialysis patients requires further investigation in larger groups. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Many features of the Torque teno virus and the other anelloviruses (AVs) that have been identified after this virus was discovered in 1997 remain elusive. The immunobiology of the AVs is no exception. However, evidence is progressively accumulating that at least some AVs have an interesting interplay with cells and soluble factors known to contribute to the homeostasis of innate and adaptive immunity. Evidence is also accumulating that this interplay can have a significant impact on how effectively an infected host can deal with superimposed infectious and non-infectious noxae. This review article discusses the scanty information available on these aspects and highlights the ones that would be more urgent to precisely understand in order to get an adequate assessment of how important for human health these extremely ubiquitous and pervasive viruses really are. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - This chapter examines the correlation between Torque teno virus (TTV) and chicken anemia virus (CAV). Each has a circular single-stranded (ss)DNA genome with every one of its known open reading frames (ORF) on its antigenomic strand. This structure is distinct from those of circoviruses. The genomic sizes of TTV and CAV are different, 3.8 kb and 2.3 kb, respectively. While the spectrum of the TTV genome is enormously diverse, that of the CAV genome is quite narrow. Although a 36-nt stretch near the replication origin of TA278 TTV possesses more than 80% similarity to that of CAV, the sequence of the other genomic regions does not exhibit a significant similarity. Nevertheless, the relative allocation of ORFs on each frame in these viruses mimics each other. Three or more messenger RNA (mRNAs) are generated by transcription in both of them. The structural protein with the replicase domain is coded for by frame 1 in each virus, and a nonstructural protein with a phosphatase domain is coded for by frame 2. A protein on frame 3 in each virus induces apoptosis in transformed cells. Recently, we confirmed that apoptin is necessary for the replication of CAV. TTV has been proposed to constitute a new family, Anelloviridae. Considering these similarities and dissimilarities between CAV and TTV, it seems more reasonable to place CAV, the only member of genus Gyrovirus, into Anelloviridae together with TTV, or into a new independent family. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Since 1997, groups of novel nonenveloped DNA viruses with a circular, single-stranded (negative sense) DNA genome of 3.6-3.9 kb, 3.2 kb, or 2.8-2.9 kb in size have been discovered and designated Torque teno virus (TTV), Torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), and Torque teno mini virus (TTMV), respectively, in the floating genus Anellovirus . These three anelloviruses frequently and ubiquitously infect humans, and the infections are characterized by lifelong viremia and great genetic variability. Although TTV infection has been epidemiologically suggested to be associated with many diseases including liver diseases, respiratory disorders, hematological disorders, and cancer, there is no direct causal evidence for links between TTV infection and specific clinical diseases. The pathogenetic role of TTMV and TTMDV infections remains unknown. The changing ratio of the three anelloviruses to each other over time, relative viral load, or combination of different genotype(s) of each anellovirus may be associated with the pathogenicity or the disease-inducing potential of these three human anelloviruses. To clarify their disease association, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) systems for accurately detecting, differentiating, and quantitating all of the genotypes and/or genogroups of TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV should be established and standardized, as should methods to detect past infections and immunological responses to anellovirus infections. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Chicken anemia virus (CAV), the only member of the genus Gyrovirus of the Circoviridae, is a ubiquitous pathogen of chickens and has a worldwide distribution . CAV shares some similarities with Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) such as coding for a protein inducing apoptosis and a protein with a dual-specificity phosphatase. In contrast to TTV, the genome of CAV is highly conserved. Another important difference is that CAV can be isolated in cell culture. CAV produces a single polycis-tronic messenger RNA (mRNA), which is translated into three proteins. The promoter-enhancer region has four direct repeats resembling estrogen response elements. Transcription is enhanced by estrogen and repressed by at least two other transcription factors, one of which is COUP-TF1. A remarkable feature of CAV is that the virus can remain latent in gonadal tissues in the presence or absence of virus-neutralizing antibodies. In contrast to TTV, CAV can cause clinical disease and subclinical immunosuppression especially affecting CD8 + T lymphocytes. Clinical disease is associated with infection in newly hatched chicks lacking maternal antibodies or older chickens with a compromised humoral immune response. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Torque teno viruses (TTVs) share several genomic similarities with the chicken anemia virus (CAV). CAV encodes the protein apoptin that specifically induces apoptosis in (human) tumor cells. Functional studies reveal that apoptin induces apoptosis in a very broad range of (human) tumor cells. A putative TTV open reading frame (ORF) in TTV genotype 1, named TTV apoptosis inducing protein (TAIP), it induces, like apoptin, p53-independent apoptosis in various human hepato-carcinoma cell lines to a similar level as apoptin. In comparison to apoptin, TAIP action is less pronounced in several analyzed human non-hepatocarcinoma-derived cell lines. Detailed sequence analysis has revealed that the TAIP ORF is conserved within a limited group of the heterogeneous TTV population. However, its N-terminal half, N-TAIP, is rather well conserved in a much broader set of TTV isolates. The similarities between apoptin and TAIP, and their relevance for the development and treatment of diseases is discussed. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Ten years after the identification of the first partial sequences of Torque teno virus (TTV), more than 200 full-length related genomes have been characterized in humans and in several animal species. As suspected in the earlier stages of their description, a considerable genetic variability characterizes TTV and related viruses, the current members of the floating genus Anellovirous. Since information related to anelloviruses diversity is in constant evolution, the challenge in their taxonomic classification is to take into account all pertinent parameters, along with the taxonomic situation of other viruses having circular single-stranded DNA genomes. Past, present and future phylogenetic and taxonomic considerations are exposed. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Torque teno (TT) viruses have been more frequently reported in malignant biopsies when compared to normal control tissue. The possible contribution of TT virus infection to human carcinogenesis or the potential oncolytic functions of these virus infections are being discussed based on available experimental evidence. The data could suggest an involvement of TT virus infections as an indirect carcinogen by modulating T cell immune responses. Significant oncolytic functions, potentially mediated by the inhibition of nuclear factor (NF)-kB transcription factor or by apoptin-like gene activities, are emerging to be less likely. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - The host cells and the events in the cells during Torque teno (TT) virus infection are at present unknown. Replicating TT virus DNA has been detected in liver, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), and in bone marrow. By alternative splicing this small virus generates three mRNA species, from which by alternative translation initiation at least six proteins are produced. The functions of the proteins are not yet fully understood. However, functions associated with, e.g., DNA replication, immunomodulation, and apoptosis have been suggested to reside in the multifunctional proteins of anelloviruses. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - A role for the ubiquitous Torque teno (TT) viruses in the pathogenesis of disease has not been resolved. In vivo and in vitro intragenomic rearrangement of TT virus genomes has been demonstrated. Replication in cell culture of a subviral molecule (411 bp) occurs through oligomerisation of RNA transcripts. Although the functions of the respective TT viral genes, as well as the newly formed genes in the rearranged subviral molecules, are largely unknown, certain similarities to genes of plant viruses of the family Geminiviridae will be described. A degree of similarity to certain cellular genes poses the question as to a role of molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease and diabetes. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Infection with TT virus (Torque teno virus, TTV), a small, nonenveloped virus with a circular, single-stranded DNA genome classified in the floating genus Anellovirus , is not restricted to humans. Using highly conserved primers derived from the untranslated region of the human TTV genome, a variety of TTV-like viruses have been found circulating in nonhuman primates such as chimpanzees, macaques, and tamarins. TTV variants in nonhuman primates are species-specific, although some genetic groups of human and chimpanzee TTVs cluster to make human/chimpanzee clades. TTVs from macaques and tamarins are increasingly divergent from TTV variants infecting humans and chimpanzees. TTV-like mini virus (TTMV) infections have also been detected in chimpanzees, with genotypes distinct but interspersed with human TTMV genotypes. Pets are also naturally infected with species-specific TTVs, and several isolates have been found in cats and dogs. In addition, other mammals such as tupaias and pigs have species-specific TTVs: swine TTVs are found among pigs worldwide. The genomic organization and proposed transcriptional profiles of TTVs infecting nonhuman primate and other mammalian species are similar to those of human TTVs, and co-evolution of TTVs with their hosts has been suggested. To date, TTVs infecting nonhuman primates and other mammalian species have been under-examined. It is likely that essentially all animals are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs. © 2009 Springer.

AB  - Forty-four raw milk and 15 serum samples from 44 healthy water buffaloes reared in Caserta, southern Italy, the most important region in Europe for buffalo breeding, were examined to evaluate the presence of Torque teno viruses (TTV) using molecular tools. Furthermore, 8 pooled pasteurized milk samples (from dairy factories having excellent sanitary conditions) and 6 Mozzarella cheese samples were also tested. Four of the cheese samples were commercial Mozzarella cheese; the remaining 2 were prepared with TTV-containing milk. Human TTV were detected and confirmed by sequencing in 7 samples of milk (approximately 16%). No TTV were found in serum, pooled pasteurized milk, or Mozzarella cheese samples. The samples of Mozzarella cheese prepared with TTV-containing milk did not show any presence of TTV, which provides evidence that standard methodological procedures to prepare Mozzarella cheese seem to affect viral structure, making this food fit for human consumption. The 7 TTV species from water buffaloes were identified as genotypes corresponding to the tth31 (3 cases), sle 1981, sle 2031, and NLC030 (2 cases each) human isolates. Although cross-species infection may occur, detection of TTV DNA in milk but not in serum led us to believe that its presence could be due to human contamination rather than a true infection. Finally, the mode of transmission of TTV has not been determined. Contaminated of the food chain with TTV may be a potential risk for hu-man health, representing one of the multiple routes of infection. © American Dairy Science Association, 2009.

AB  - Porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV-2) has been found to be the causative agent of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). However, PCV-2 is a ubiquitous virus in the swine population and a majority of pigs infected with PCV-2 do not develop the disease. Different factors such as age, maintenance, the genetics of PCV-2, other pathogens, etc. have been suggested to contribute to the development of PMWS. However, so far no proven connection between any of these factors and the disease development has been found. In this study we explored the possible presence of other so far unknown DNA containing infectious agents in lymph nodes collected from Swedish pigs with confirmed PMWS through random amplification and high-throughput sequencing. Although the vast majority of the amplified genetic sequences belonged to PCV-2, we also found genome sequences of Torque Teno virus (TTV) and of a novel parvovirus. The detection of TTV was expected since like PCV-2, TTV has been found to have high prevalence in pigs around the world. We were able to amplify a longer region of the parvovirus genome, consisting of the entire NP1 and partial VP1/2. By comparative analysis of the nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic studies we propose that this is a novel porcine parvovirus, with genetic relationship to bocaviruses. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Human-specific Bacteroides HF183 (HS-HF183), human-specific Enterococci faecium esp (HS-esp), human-specific adenoviruses (HS-AVs) and human-specific polyomaviruses (HS-PVs) assays were evaluated in freshwater, seawater and distilled water to detect fresh sewage. The sewage spiked water samples were also tested for the concentrations of traditional fecal indicators (i.e., Escherichia coli, enterococci and Clostridium perfringens) and enteric viruses such as enteroviruses (EVs), sapoviruses (SVs), and torquetenoviruses (TVs). The overall host-specificity of the HS-HF183 marker to differentiate between humans and other animals was 98%. However, the HS-esp, HS-AVs and HS-PVs showed 100% host-specificity. All the human-specific markers showed &gt;97% sensitivity to detect human fecal pollution. E. coli, enterococci and, C. perfringens were detected up to dilutions of sewage 10-5, 10-4 and 10-3 respectively. HS-esp, HS-AVs, HS-PVs, SVs and TVs were detected up to dilution of sewage 10-4 whilst EVs were detected up to dilution 10-5. The ability of the HS-HF183 marker to detect fresh sewage was 3-4 orders of magnitude higher than that of the HS-esp and viral markers. The ability to detect fresh sewage in freshwater, seawater and distilled water matrices was similar for human-specific bacterial and viral marker. Based on our data, it appears that human-specific molecular markers are sensitive measures of fresh sewage pollution, and the HS-HF183 marker appears to be the most sensitive among these markers in terms of detecting fresh sewage. However, the presence of the HS-HF183 marker in environmental waters may not necessarily indicate the presence of enteric viruses due to their high abundance in sewage compared to enteric viruses. More research is required on the persistency of these markers in environmental water samples in relation to traditional fecal indicators and enteric pathogens. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Patients with thalassemia major, intermedia or double eterozygous with sickle cell disease are exposed to a major risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Transfusion-transmitted viral infections and long standing iron overload represent principal carcinogenic risk factors. Every effort should be made to prevent tumor development, whose prognosis is usually dismal, or at least to make an early diagnosis. Screening should be performed regularly by means of ultra-sonography (US) and measurement of serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped human virus with a circular (∼ 3800 nt) ssDNA genome. TTV transcription results in three viral mRNAs and six proteins, the function or antigenicity of which are unknown. The six open reading frames of TTV genotype 6 were expressed in bacteria and insect cells. Expression of the ORF1/1-encoded protein was inefficient, while expression of the others was successful, with ORF1 and ORF1/2 as arginine-rich region depleted. All six recombinant TTV proteins were antigenic. Of healthy adults, 11 / 25 (44%) showed strong IgG reactivity with one or more proteins. Four subjects, two of whom were genotype-6-DNA positive, were followed. One of the latter showed concurrently a strong IgG response against the ORF1 protein. The other showed appearance of IgG against the ORF2 protein concomitantly with resolution of the genotype-6 viremia. The genotype-6 sequences remained unaltered for years, suggesting that some mechanisms other than amino acid substitutions play a role in TTV immune evasion. © 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective - To determine whether porcine genogroup 1 torque teno virus (g1-TTV) can infect and cause disease in gnotobiotic swine. Sample Population - 20 conventional baby pigs and 46 gnotobiotic baby pigs. Procedures - Porcine g1-TTV was transmitted from conventional swine to gnotobiotic pigs via pooled leukocyte-rich plasmas (n = 18) that had positive results for g1-TTV DNA. Bone marrow-liver homogenates that had positive results for torque teno virus (TTV) were used in 4 serial passages in gnotobiotic pigs (2 pigs/passage). A pathogenesis experiment was conducted with in vivo passages of g1-TTV in various groups of gnotobiotic pigs. Results - All g1-TTV inoculated pigs had no clinical signs but developed interstitial pneumonia, transient thymic atrophy, membranous glomerulonephropathy, and modest lymphocytic to histiocytic infiltrates in the liver after inoculation with the TTV-containing tissue homogenate; these changes were not detected in uninoculated control pigs or pigs injected with tissue homogenate devoid of TTV DNAs. In situ hybridization was used to identify g1-TTV DNAs in bone marrow mononuclear cells. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Analysis of these data revealed that porcine g1-TTV was readily transmitted to TTV-naïve swine and that infection was associated with characteristic pathologic changes in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with g1-TTV. Thus, g1-TTV could be an unrecognized pathogenic viral infectious agent of swine. This indicated a directly associated induction of lesions attributable to TTV infection in swine for a virus of the genus Anellovirus.

AB  - Objective - To determine whether genogroup 1 porcine torque teno virus (g1-TTV) can potentiate clinical disease associated with porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2). Sample population - 33 gnotobiotic baby pigs. Procedures - Pigs were allocated into 7 groups: group A, 5 uninoculated control pigs from 3 litters; group B, 4 pigs oronasally inoculated with PCV2 alone; group C, 4 pigs inoculated IP with first-passage g1-TTV alone; group D, 4 pigs inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV alone; group E, 6 pigs inoculated IP with first-passage g1-TTV and then oronasally inoculated with PCV2 7 days later; group F, 6 pigs inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV and then inoculated oronasally with PCV2 7 days later; and group G, 4 pigs inoculated oronasally with PCV2 and then inoculated IP with fourth-passage g1-TTV 7 days later. Results - 6 of 12 pigs inoculated with g1-TTV prior to PCV2 developed acute onset of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). None of the pigs inoculated with g1-TTV alone or PCV2 alone or that were challenge exposed to g1-TTV after establishment of infection with PCV2 developed clinical illness. Uninoculated control pigs remained healthy. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - These data implicated g1-TTV as another viral infection that facilitates PCV2-induced PMWS. This raises the possibility that torque teno viruses in swine may contribute to disease expression currently associated with only a single infectious agent.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) belongs to the floating genus of Anellovirus. It was discovered in a human patient, and later it was also found in animals including pigs. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Hungarian pig herds for the first time, and to characterise the viruses found. Serum samples of 82 adult swine from 13 piggeries and 44 weaned pigs from one large herd were tested by PCR for the presence of TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in 30% of the adult swine and 73% of the weaned pigs tested. Liver and intestine of weaned pigs were also tested and found to be infected at a lower rate. The TTV sequences found in sera and intestines were similar and could be clustered as swine genogroup 1. However, the sequences derived from one liver were remarkably different from all other known genogroups and seemed to represent a new genogroup. © 2008 Akademiai Kiado, Budapest.

AB  - Objective - To determine whether commercial Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae bacterins sold for use in swine contain porcine torque teno virus (TTV). Sample Population - 22 commercially available M hyopneumoniae bacterins. Procedures - Direct and nested PCR assays for genogroup-specific TTV DNAs were performed on serials of M hyopneumoniae bacterins by use of published and custom-designed primer pairs at 3 laboratories in North America and Europe. Results - Of the 22 bacterins tested by use of direct and nested PCR assays, 7 of 9 from the United States, 2 of 5 from Canada, and 4 of 8 from Europe contained genogroup 1- and genogroup 2-TTV DNAs. In some bacterins, the TTV DNAs were readily detected by use of direct PCR assays. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - Analysis of these data indicated that many of the commercially available M hyopneumoniae bacterins were contaminated with TTV/DNA. It is possible that some of these bacterins could inadvertently transmit porcine-TTV infection to TTV-naïve swine.

AB  - This study was designed so that three sensitive and widely-used polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods for the detection of TT virus or Torque Teno virus (TTV) would be simultaneously applied to a large number of subjects to evaluate performances of the various PCR protocols with different genotype sensitivities. Sera were collected from 92 children admitted to Hacettepe University Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital Pediatric Gastroenterology Unit (17 cryptogenic chronic hepatitis, 17 asymptomatic HBs carriers, 18 chronic HBV patients and 40 healthy children). TTV DNA was detected via nested N22, nested 3'-UTR and 5′-UTR PCRs for all samples. Differences in TTV DNA detection prevalences were not statistically significant between the study groups with all methods. No significant correlation was detected between presence of TTV DNA and liver enzyme levels. A significant agreement between PCR methods that target UTR was observed. TTV detection rate increased with age, suggesting a non-parenteral, environmental exposure to the virus for the study population.

AB  - Objective - To determine whether porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome (PDNS) could be experimentally induced in gnotobiotic swine. Sample Population - Plasma samples from 27 sows and 20 conventional weaned piglets were obtained, and 30 gnotobiotic pigs were used in experiments. Procedures - 3 experiments were conducted. Groups of 3-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with pooled plasma samples obtained from healthy feeder pigs in a herd that was in the initial phases of an outbreak of respiratory disease; gross and histologic lesions of PDNS were detected in the inoculated pigs. In a second experiment, 2- and 3-day-old gnotobiotic pigs were inoculated with porcine reproductive respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and with PRRSV-negative tissue homogenate containing genogroup 1 torque teno virus (g1-TTV). Lesions of PDNS were detected. Results - Pigs inoculated with pooled plasma or the combination of tissue-culture-origin PRRSV and g1-TTV tissue homogenate developed systemic hemostatic defects, bilaterally symmetric cutaneous hemorrhages, generalized edema, icterus, bilaterally symmetric renal cortical hemorrhage, dermal vasculitis with hemorrhage, and interstitial pneumonia consistent with a clinical and pathologic diagnosis of PDNS. The PRRSV RNAs and g1-TTV DNAs were detected in plasma; all pigs seroconverted to PRRSV, and all had negative results for porcine circovirus type 2 when tested by use of PCR assays. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance - These data suggested that PDNS is a manifestation of disseminated intravascular coagulation in swine. For the experimental conditions reported here combined infection with g1-TTV and PRRSV was implicated in the genesis of these lesions.

AB  - The SEN virus has-been tentatively linked to transfusion-associated non-A to E hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to 1) determine the prevalence of SEN virus among Egyptian patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease and patients undergoing hemodialysis and 2) demonstrate the clinical effect of SEN virus infection on coexistent hepatitis C in terms of severity and probability of developing hepatocellular carcinoma. Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect SEN virus-D and SEN virus-H DNA in serum samples of 74 patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, 45 uremic patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, and 28 healthy controls. SEN virus-D/H DNA was detected in 13.5% of patients with chronic liver disease, 11.1% of patients undergoing hemodialysis, and 7.1% of healthy controls, with no significant differences between patients and the control group. Clinical and biochemical measures did not significantly differ between SEN virus-infected and noninfected patients in the chronic liver disease group or the hemodialysis group. The rate of SEN virus infection was significantly higher in patients with chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (33.3%) than in those with chronic liver disease only (8.5%) (P<.05). In conclusion, SEN virus does not seem to be a common infection in Egyptian patients. It has no apparent influence on the severity of coexistent HCV-related chronic liver disease but could be a risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma in such patients. Further studies are needed to define the etiopathogenic role of SEN virus infection in the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. © 2008 Medscape.

AB  - Aim: TT virus (TTV) is genetically variable and widespread without apparent pathogenicity; however, its epidemiological features in children were not fully understood, partly because blood sampling is often unacceptable for healthy children. We therefore used saliva specimens to investigate epidemiology of TTV infection in early childhood. Methods: Saliva samples were collected from 83 1-month-old, 110 4-month-old and 49 42-month-old children. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and saliva samples were obtained in pairs from 19 healthy adults aged 40 ± 7 years. TTV DNA was detected and quantified by real-time PCR and classified into five genogroups (G1-G5) by a series of PCRs using genogroup-specific primer pairs. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 6, 34 and 90% of children aged 1, 4 and 42 months, respectively, and in 84% of adults. Comparable levels of TTV DNA were detected in pairs of saliva and PBMC. TTV loads in saliva were much higher in children than in adults. G3 was the most common genogroup in all age groups. The second most prevalent was G4 at 1-4 months of age and G1 thereafter. Conclusion: The prevalence of TTV infection reached a plateau at or before 42 months; however, somehow different epidemiologic features were observed among genogroups. ©2008 The Author(s).

AB  - Ten years after their discovery, anelloviruses combine some characteristics making them particularly intriguing. In support of their extreme genetic diversity and high prevalence in various populations, their natural history is still poorly understood along with their implication in human health. These viruses have been identified in blood and blood-derived products, and are probably remarkable examples of co-existence and co-evolution in their various hosts. This article presents epidemiological and molecular characterizing this new viral family. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Aims: It has been suggested that, in HIV-HCV co-infected patients, co-infections with other viruses may affect the response to HCV therapy. We aimed to assess the prevalence of GBV-C, SEN-V and occult HBV infections, their impact on HCV and HIV infections and on the response to HCV therapy in HIV-HCV co-infected patients. Methods: Three-hundred and sixty eight patients were tested before starting interferon-ribavirin for the presence of occult hepatitis B DNA, GBV-C RNA and SEN-V DNA by using real time PCR. Clinical, immunological, virological, histological characteristics and response to HCV therapy were compared according to the presence or not of each viral co-infection. Results: HBV DNA, GBV-C RNA and SEN-V DNA were found in 5 (1.4%, CI95%: 0.2-2.4%), 104 (29.9%, CI95%: 25.1-34.7%) and 209 patients (57.9%, CI95%: 52.8-63.0%), respectively. GBV-C positive patients had significantly higher CD4 count at baseline, during and after HCV therapy, even after stratification on antiretroviral treatment. No other significant difference was observed according to the presence or not of GBV-C or SEN-V co-infection, in particular regarding virological responses to HCV combination therapy. Conclusions: There is no reason to withhold HCV therapy in HIV infected patients who have access to HAART, because of occult HBV, GBV-C or SEN-V co-infections. © 2008 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB  - Background: Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection is currently one of the most relevant coinfections in HIV positive patients. The influence of SEN Virus (SENV) on the outcome of HCV therapy in HIV/HCV coinfected patients who underwent combination therapy with pegylated interferon (PEG-IFN) and ribavirin is unclear. Methods: SENV DNA was determined by polymerase chain reaction in 67 HIV/ HCV coinfected patients, 77 HIV monoinfected patients, 95 treatment naïve HCV monoinfetcted patients, and 122 healthy blood donors. Quantitative analysis was done for SENV H DNA. Results: SENV DNA was detected in 8 of 67 (12%) HIV/HCV coinfected patients, in 9 of 77 (11.7%) HIV monoinfected patients, in 21 of 95 (22%) HCV monoinfected patients, and 12 of 122 (9.8%) healthy blood donors. HIV monoinfected patients showed the highest mean SENV H DNA level. The mean SENV H DNA was significantly lower in HIV/HCV coinfected patients compared to all other groups. The sustained virological response rates to combination therapy of HCV in HIV/HCV coinfected patients did not differ between patients with detectable SENV 5/8 (62.5%) and without SENV 28/59 (47.5%; p = 0.47). We found no significant difference in SENV H DNA pretreatment levels between nonresponders and responders to combination therapy (112 ± 144 copies vs. 8 ± 7 copies/ml; p = 0.27). Conclusion: Coinfection with HCV may reduce SENV H replication in HIV positive patients and results in significantly lower SENV H DNA levels in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. SENV infection has no influence on the outcome of HCV combination therapy in HIV/HCV coinfected patients. © I. Holzapfel Publishers 2008.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) has been assigned to the floating genus Anellovirus. TTV ssDNA genomes have a size of 3.6 to 3.8 kb and display up to 30% nucleotide diversity. The pathogenic potential of TTV is under investigation. To address a putative link of pathogenicity with the observed sequence variations, the transcription profile of P/1C1 (genogroup 1) isolated from a patient diseased with a non A-G hepatitis was analysed. Four mRNAs were identified, which encoded the seven proteins ORF1, ORF1/1, ORF1/2, ORF2, ORF2/2, ORF3 and ORF4. Expression of the ORF1 protein and its splice variant ORF1/1 in cell culture was detected by an ORF1-specific antiserum. Analysis of N-terminal tagged P/1C1-encoded proteins revealed that ORF1, ORF1/1 and ORF1/2 were localised in the nucleoli, ORF3 and ORF4 resided in the nucleoplasm, ORF2/2 appeared either in the nucleoli or the whole nucleus while ORF2 was the only protein seen in the cytoplasm. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Aim: To explore the prevalence of SEN virus (SENV) in patients with non A-E hepatitis and volunteer blood donors in Shanghai. Methods: According to the published gene sequences, primers from the conserved region were designed. Then, the prevalence of SEN virus in 30 samples from healthy voluntary blood donors and 30 samples from patients with non A-E hepatitis were detected by nested-PCR of SFNV-D/H. Some PCR products were cloned and sequenced. Results: The specificity of genotype-specific PCR was confirmed by sequencing, the SENV DNA was detected in 53.3% of the patients with non A-E hepatitis and 10% of the blood donors. The prevalence of SENV-D/H viremia was significantly higher in patients with non A-E hepatitis than in blood donors (P = 0.0002). SENV-H subtype and SENV-D subtype were found in 2 and 1 samples, respectively from blood donors. SENV-H subtype, SENV D subtype, mixed SENV-D and SENV-H subtype were found in 8, 6 and 2 samples, respectively, from patients with non A-E hepatitis. Conclusion: The gene type of SENV in patients with non A-E hepatitis and blood donors in shanghai is D or H subtype, and transfusion is not the only transmitting form of SENV. © 2008 The WJG Press.

AB  - Background. Currently applied indicator organism systems, such as coliforms, are not fully protective of public health from enteric viruses in water sources. Waterborne disease outbreaks have occurred in systems that tested negative for coliforms, and positive coliform results do not necessarily correlate with viral risk. It is widely recognized that bacterial indicators do not co-occur exclusively with infectious viruses, nor do they respond in the same manner to environmental or engineered stressors. Thus, a more appropriate indicator of health risks from infectious enteric viruses is needed. Presentation of the hypothesis. Torque teno virus is a small, non-enveloped DNA virus that likely exhibits similar transport characteristics to pathogenic enteric viruses. Torque teno virus is unique among enteric viral pathogens in that it appears to be ubiquitous in humans, elicits seemingly innocuous infections, and does not exhibit seasonal fluctuations or epidemic spikes. Torque teno virus is transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route and can be assayed using rapid molecular techniques. We hypothesize that Torque teno virus is a more appropriate indicator of viral pathogens in drinking waters than currently used indicator systems based solely on bacteria. Testing the hypothesis. To test the hypothesis, a multi-phased research approach is needed. First, a reliable Torque teno virus assay must be developed. A rapid, sensitive, and specific PCR method using established nested primer sets would be most appropriate for routine monitoring of waters. Because PCR detects both infectious and inactivated virus, an in vitro method to assess infectivity also is needed. The density and occurrence of Torque teno virus in feces, wastewater, and source waters must be established to define spatial and temporal stability of this potential indicator. Finally, Torque teno virus behavior through drinking water treatment plants must be determined with co-assessment of traditional indicators and enteric viral pathogens to assess whether correlations exist. Implications of the hypothesis. If substantiated, Torque teno virus could provide a completely new, reliable, and efficient indicator system for viral pathogen risk. This indicator would have broad application to drinking water utilities, watershed managers, and protection agencies and would provide a better means to assess viral risk and protect public health. © 2008 Griffin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the prevalence and genotype distribution of Torque teno virus (TTV) in patients with different liver diseases and chronic renal failure treated at a referral hospital in North India. Methods: Whereas prevalence of TTV was based on amplification of conserved region of ORF2 of TTV genome, the genotyping of TTV was carried out using restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) procedure on the N22 region of ORF1. Results: TTV-DNA was detected in 137 of 513 (26.7%) patients with liver diseases and 38 of 65 (58.5%) patients with chronic renal failure. TTV was also detected in 27% of healthy controls. The sequence analysis of the PCR product from 10 randomly selected cases failed to show a significant sequence divergence when compared with that of the TRM1 isolate of TTV genotype 1. The results of genotyping in 55 randomly selected patients showed the presence of genotype 1 (G1) in 53 (96.4%) and genotype 2 (G2) in 2 cases (3.6%), respectively. Other genotypes were not identified in this patient subgroup, suggesting that G1 is predominant in this area. The results of genotyping by RFLP were also supported by phylogenetic tree analysis, where G1 was found to be the major genotype. Conclusion: These results indicate that TTV is moderately present in Indian patients, with G1 to be the major genotype in North India. The pathogenicity and etiological role of TTV in different diseases is still a question mark and warrant further studies. © 2008 The WJG Press. All rights reserved.

AB  - Municipal and agricultural wastewater contain a variety of microorganisms and in particular enteric viruses. For the reuse of this treated wastewater it is important to ensure the efficiency of purification treatments and disinfection practices, that have often been insufficient to lower the viral load below the risk level. For this reason, for the routine analysis of recycled waters, the research into pathogenic viruses (e.g. HAV) and classical bacterial parameters (E coli, enterococci and Salmonella) has to be associated with specific viral indicators such as somatic coliphages, adenovirus and TTV. The results of environmental monitoring, carried out in a wastewater treatment plant, showed the presence of adenovirus DNA in 100% of collected samples and TTV DNA in 95% (19/20) of raw sewage and in 85% (17/20) of the exit samples, while HAV was detected only in 2 samples over 40 (5%). The quantitative analysis has revealed an average reduction of 2 log for adenovirus and 1.58 log for TTV. The bacterial indicators were reduced by 1.74 log and 1.99 log respectively for E coli and enterococci, while for somatic coliphages an average reduction of 2.2 log was observed. No significant correlation was shown between these parameters, confirming their inadequacy for the virological risk assessment. However the results of adenovirus confirm it as the best indicator to evaluate the efficacy of wastewater depuration plant in eliminating viruses. © IWA Publishing 2008.

AB  - Few studies have been performed on the prevalence of Torque Teno Virus (TTV) infection in liver transplant (LT) recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence, viremia and genogroup pattern of TTV among LT patients and to ascertain whether TTV causes liver damage in liver transplanted patients with biochemical and histological changes of unknown origin. Twenty-five patients were evaluated before and after LT; 80 healthy subjects were considered as controls. Serum samples were serially obtained from all the patients before LT and thereafter at 3, 6 and 12 months post-transplant. Serum TTV-DNA and genogroups were assessed by PCR. Patients underwent protocol serial liver biopsies at 6 and 12 months after LT. Results were compared using the Chi-squared tests, McNemar's and Student's t-tests. TTV-DNA was found in 25/25 patients before LT and in 60/80 blood donors (P < 0.01). The TTV-DNA load increased significantly after LT (P < 0.001). TTV-DNA was significantly higher in patients on calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) and azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil than in patients on CNI alone (P = 0.04) at 3 months after LT. Genogroup analysis showed a significant increase in genogroup 5 positivity after LT. No differences were seen in the viremia of patients compared according to their viral versus other etiologies of their liver disease before transplantation. Viremia and TTV genotype patterns did not correlate with the presence of hypertransaminasemia or histological liver damage of unknown etiology. The prevalence of TTV-DNA was significantly higher in patients with liver cirrhosis than in controls and the viral load was significantly higher after LT than beforehand. On the basis of our data, TTV does not seem to cause liver damage following LT, although larger studies with a long-term follow up are needed to confirm these findings. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Current clinical studies on human annelloviruses infections are directed towards finding an associated disease. In this review we have emphasized the many similarities between human anellovirus and avian circoviruses and the cell and tissue types infected by these pathogens. We have done this in order to explore whether knowledge acquired from natural and experimental avian infections could reflect and be extrapolated to the less well-characterized human annellovirus infections. The knowledge gained from the avian system may provide suggestions for decoding the enigmatic human anellovirus infections, and finding the specific disease or diseases caused by these human anellovirus infections. Each additional parallelism between chicken anemia virus (CAV) and Torque teno virus (TTV) further strengthens this premise. As we have seen information from human infections can also be used to better understand avian infections as well. Increased attention must be focused on the "hidden" or unrecognized, seemingly asymptomatic effects of circovirus and anellovirus infections. Understanding the facilitating effect of these infections on disease progression caused by other pathogens may help to explain differences in outcome of complicated poultry and human diseases. The final course of a pathogenic infection is determined by variations in the state of health of the host before, during and after contact with a pathogen, in addition to the phenotype of the pathogen and host. The health burden of circoviridae and anellovirus infections may be underestimated, due to lack of awareness of the need to search past the predominant clinical effect of identified pathogens and look for modulation of cellular-based immunity caused by co-infecting circoviruses, and by analogy, human anneloviruses. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Introduction: The frequency of TT virus (TTV) infection is significant so there are many studies concerned to pathogenic importance of virus. It is analyzed the role of infection in liver diseases and gastrointestinal tract, respiratory system, blood and urinary system diseases. Aim of study: The aim of study was to asses clinical picture of TTV infections in children aged 1-36 months. Material and methods: To the study were enrolled 55 children, aged 1-36 months, hospitalized for different illnesses. In 27 children (49%) during this hospitalization TTV infection was detected (PCR method with two primers sets). We compared results of clinical examination and laboratory test between groups of children: with and without TTV infection. Results: It was no dependence of actual diagnosis on TTV status. Similar were morphology parameters except monocytosis - It was less frequent In TTV-infected group. Mean value of AIAT (alanine aminotranspherase) and AspAT (asparaginian aminotranspherase) activity was higher in noninfected children (for AspAT statistical important, p=0.04). Conclusions: It was no dependence of acute respiratory illnesses or gastrointestinal tract illnesses on TTV status in infants and young children. It was no negative importance of TTV infection for results of basic laboratory tests in that group. Copyright © 2008 Almamedia.

AB  - Aims: Torque teno virus (TTV) is a human DNA virus chronically infecting most healthy individuals worldwide and can be transmitted by faecal-oral route. The occurrence of TTV was evaluated in the streams crossing the city of Manaus (Brazilian Amazon) over a 1-year period, four times a year. Methods and Results: Fifty-two water samples were collected from 13 different locations. Viruses were concentrated from two litres of water by adsorption to negative membrane filters followed by ultrafiltration. TTV DNA was detected by PCR assays designed to detect all five TTV genomic groups. By conventional PCR, 19/52 (37%) samples were positive. By real-time PCR, TTV DNA could be detected in 48/52 (92%) samples. Viral loads ranged from 1300 to 746 000 genome equivalent per 100 ml of river water. Eleven distinct nucleotide sequences were obtained. Conclusions: Our results show the wide distribution and diversity of TTV among Manaus urban micro basins. Significance and Impact of the Study: The data presented here may contribute to substantiate TTV as a sensitive indicator of human contamination. © 2008 The Authors.

AB  - Background: SEN virus is a blood-borne, single-stranded, nonenveloped DNA virus. Two of its strains (D and H), appear to be associated with non-A-to-E hepatitis more frequently than the others, although it is not clear whether this observation has any significance. The prevalence of SEN virus in otherwise healthy individuals, including blood donors, differs markedly by geographic region. In this study, an investigation to evaluate the prevalence of SEN virus strains among blood donors in Tehran was carried out. Methods: Sera of 260 blood donors who were negative for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and third-generation hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) were tested for SEN virus-D and -H DNA. DNA was extracted from plasma of 260 blood donors and amplified by semi- nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: SEN virus-D viremia was detected in four (1.5%) of the 260 blood donors (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.0 - 3%). SEN virus-H viremia was detected in 47 (18.08 %) of the 260 blood donors (95% CI, 13.4 - 22.8%). Both SEN virus-D and SEN virus-H viremia were detected in nine (3.4%) of the 260 blood donors (95% CI, 1.2 - 5.7%). SEN virus-D or SEN virus-H viremia was identified in 60 (23.08%) of the 260 blood donors (95% CI, 18.08 - 28.08%). Conclusion: Out of the 260 blood donors, 60 (23%) were infected by SEN virus-D/H. The prevalence of SEN virus-H is more than SEN virus-D. Our results also showed that the high prevalence of SEN virus in healthy blood donors with no history of blood transfusion may attribute to the transmission modes other than parenteral transmission.

AB  - Background/aims: SEN viruses are transmitted parenterally and can cause post-transfusion hepatitis. The prevalence and clinical significance of SEN viruses have been investigated in patients with chronic hepatitis C and B but not in D. We aimed to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of SEN viruses-H in patients with chronic hepatitis C, B and delta in Turkey. Methods: SEN viruses-H was analyzed in 85 patients with chronic viral hepatitis (30 HCV, 30 HBV and 25 HDV) and 43 non-professional blood donors. HBV DNA, HCV RNA and HDV RNA were positive in patients with hepatitis B, C and D, respectively. SEN viruses-H DNA was detected by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction method (L2AS, C5S primer in first step, L2AS, D11 in second step) after extraction of DNA from sera (NucleoSpin blood; Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co KG, Germany). Results: SEN viruses-H DNA was found to be positive in 7/30 (23.3%), 10/30 (33.3%), 6/25 (24%), and 7/43 (16.2%) of patients with chronic C, B, and D hepatitis and healthy blood donors, respectively. There was no significant difference in clinical features and treatment response between SEN viruses-H-positive and -negative patients with chronic viral hepatitis. Conclusions: SEN viruses is more frequent in chronic hepatitis patients than in healthy blood donors. These results indicate that SEN viruses has no effect on the clinical course and treatment response of chronic viral hepatitis.

AB  - Objective: To determine the percentage of false positive testing for transfusion transmitted infections (TTIs) using immunochromatographic test (ICT) as first line of screening tests and its effect on loss of volunteer blood donors. Methodology: Over a period of three months, samples from blood bags of donors undergoing phlebotomy at teaching hospital blood banks in Lahore were screened for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) by immunochromatographic tests. Those found positive on initial screening were re-tested by ELISA method at the screening laboratory of the Institute of Haematology & Blood Transfusion Service, Punjab. Lahore. Results: Out of a total of 62090 voluntary blood donors, 469 donors were found to be initially reactive for either HIV, HBV or HCV. Amongst these 96(0.15%) blood donors were found to have tested falsely positive for HIV, HBV or HCV as compared to testing by ELISA. Conclusions: False positive testing rate of 0.15% or 96 out of a total of 62090 donors is rather small in terms of loss of voluntary donors and appropriate utilization of available resources. Although immunochromatographic testing is not the gold standard, however it serves an important purpose of initial donor screening.

AB  - Genetic and environmental factors are believed to influence development of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Endogenous retroviruses (ERV) correspond to the integrated proviral form of infectious retroviruses, which are trapped within the genome due to mutations. ERV represent a key molecular link between the host genome and infectious viral particles. ERV-encoded proteins are recognized by antiviral immune responses and become targets of autoreactivity. Alternatively, ERV protein may influence cellular processes and the life cycle of infectious viruses. As examples, the HRES-1 human ERV encodes a 28-kDa nuclear autoantigen and a 24-kDa small GTP-ase, termed HRES-1/Rab4. HRES-1/p28 is a nuclear autoantigen recognized by cross-reactive antiviral antibodies, while HRES-1/Rab4 regulates surface expression of CD4 and the transferrin receptor (TFR) through endosome recycling. Expression of HRES-1/Rab4 is induced by the tat gene of HIV-1, which in turn down-regulates expression of CD4 and susceptibility to re-infection by HIV-1. CD4 and the TFR play essential roles in formation of the immunological synapse (IS) during normal T-cell activation by a cognate MHC class II peptide complex. The key intracellular transducer of T-cell activation, Lck, is brought to the IS via binding to CD4. T-cell receptorη (TCRη) chain binds to the TFR. Abnormal T-cell responses in SLE have been associated with reduced lck and TCRη chain levels. HRES-1 is centrally located on chromosome 1 at q42 relative to lupus-linked microsatellite markers and polymorphic HRES-1 alleles have been linked to the development of SLE. 1q42 is one of the three most common fragile sites in the human genome, and is inducible by DNA demethylation, a known mechanism of retroviral gene activation. Molecular mimicry and immunomodulation by a ERV, such as HRES-1, may contribute to self-reactivity and abnormal T and B-cell functions in SLE.

AB  - Objective: The Torque Teno virus (TTV), a member of virus genus Anellovirus has been shown to be commonly present in humans, yet without detectable pathogenicity. Recent studies imply that TTV may contribute to provoke autoimmune progresses in systemic lupus erythematosus and idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. We aimed to study the presence of TTV in a group of patients with autoimmune bullous diseases with a further goal to identify long-lasting foreign antigen, such as TTV as possible triggers of skin-specific autoimmunity. Patients and methods: We performed in silico research to study similarities between known TTV sequences and antigens of bullous pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus vulgaris (PV) and dermatitis herpetiformis (DH). Basic Local Alignment Search Tool results showed matching regions for the major BP antigens BP180 and BP230, PV antigen desmoglein 3 and DH antigen transglutaminase 3 and disclosed overlapping, antigen-predicted sequences only for BP180 regions. We also assessed the prevalence of TTV in these disorders and compared them with the results from two healthy blood donor groups (group 1: sex- and age-matched for the general bullous group, n=95; group 2: sex- and age-matched for BP, n=50). Furthermore, we assayed lymphocytes from four TTV DNA and BP180 NC16A blot-positive BP patients and three controls in a standard lymphocyte transformation test with a TTV peptide from the conserved ORF(Open Reading Frame)1/N22 region. Results: We found that the detection rate of TTV was comparable with that in healthy controls in the group of PV (19/33); whereas detection rates in DH showed a slight, but not significant tendency for elevation (17/20). Contrary, the TTV prevalence in BP patients was significantly elevated (group 1: 36/40 vs group 2: 31/50, P<0.032). Lymphocytes from all four virus-positive BP patients heavily reacted to TTV peptide while two of the three healthy controls have shown not to recognize the viral sequences. Only the TTV carrier healthy control had a minor reaction at lowest peptide concentration. The combined in silico, polymerse chain reaction and in vitro cell assay data of the present study indicate that a TTV persistence may contribute to the pathogenesis of BP. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard.

AB  - There has been a worldwide increase in the number and geographical spread of wild boar populations in recent decades leading to an increase in both the circulation of disease agents and greater contact with domestic animals and humans. Diseases affect the population dynamics of wildlife but the effects of most viral diseases on the European wild boar are largely unknown. Many viral diseases present in domestic pig populations are also present in wild boars where they can provide a disease reservoir, as is clearly the case with classical swine fever, but little is known about other viral diseases such as porcine circovirus diseases or hepatitis E. This review considers the current scientific knowledge of the effects of viral diseases on wild boar populations and their rôle as potential disease reservoirs. The focus is on those viral diseases of domestic swine and wild boars that are included as notifiable by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This work analyzes the prevalence of TTV DNA in peripheral blood cells from patients with hepatic alterations and healthy blood donors and measures levels of sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, phosphatase alkaline, total and direct bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) in certain randomly selected patients. DNA samples from 111 individuals were evaluated. They were divided into two groups, "A" (study) and "B" (control), including 54 patients with liver enzyme alterations (ALT/AST) presenting non-B-non-C hepatitis and 57 blood donors, respectively. TTV DNA was determined by nested PCR. Certain products of the second-round PCR were sequenced. Serum biochemical assay was performed and disclosed TTV in 31.48% (17/54) of patients in group A and 5.26% (3/57) in the control group B. TTV prevalence was significantly higher in patients with liver disease than in healthy donors. In group A, sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, phosphatase alkaline, total and direct bilirubin, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels were analyzed in certain randomly selected patients and no significant difference in biochemical levels (p>0.05) was found when TTV infected and noninfected individuals were compared. Knowledge related to TTV has rapidly increased, but many fundamental aspects remain unclear. This led us to question the role of TTV and doubt remains as to whether or not it is just a commensal virus. Further studies are necessary to confirm and extend these findings.

AB  - Background and objective: IPF is an independent risk factor for lung cancer, but the mechanism of this association has not fully been elucidated. The role of Torque teno virus (TTV) in respiratory disease is poorly understood, although it has been shown that infection with TTV is associated with the activity and prognosis of IPF. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence and titre of TTV DNA among patients with IPF and lung cancer. Methods: The presence of TTV DNA was determined by PCR in the sera of patients with both lung cancer and IPF (n = 22), patients with IPF only (n = 35), and patients with lung cancer only (n = 142). Results: TTV DNA was detectable in all patients with both IPF and lung cancer, in 94.3% of the patients with IPF only and 97.2% of the patients with lung cancer only. The TTV DNA titre in the patients with IPF and lung cancer was significantly higher than that in the patients with IPF only or lung cancer only. The percentage of TTV-positive patients with a high TTV titre in the IPF and lung cancer group was significantly higher than that in the IPF only group. Conclusions: These findings are the first report on the association between TTV and the complication of lung cancer in IPF and suggest that TTV infection might be associated with the development of lung cancer in IPF. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - It is estimated that viral infections contribute to 15-20% of all human cancers. As obligatory intracellular parasites, viruses encode proteins that reprogram host cellular signaling pathways that control proliferation, differentiation, cell death, genomic integrity, and recognition by the immune system. These cellular processes are governed by complex and redundant regulatory networks and are surveyed by sentinel mechanisms that ensure that aberrant cells are removed from the proliferative pool. Given that the genome size of a virus is highly restricted to ensure packaging within an infectious structure, viruses must target cellular regulatory nodes with limited redundancy and need to inactivate surveillance mechanisms that would normally recognize and extinguish such abnormal cells. In many cases, key proteins in these same regulatory networks are subject to mutation in non-virally associated diseases and cancers. Oncogenic viruses have thus served as important experimental models to identify and molecularly investigate such cellular networks. These include the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressors, identification of regulatory networks that are critical for maintenance of genomic integrity, and processes that govern immune surveillance. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - As a consequence of the high prevalence of TorqueTeno virus (TTV) in blood donors, thalassemia patients frequently acquire various genotypes of this virus through therapeutic blood transfusions. At present, the clinical consequences of TTV infection remain indeterminate for these patients. Here, several hundred thalassemia patients were tested for the presence of TTV and its genotypes using a combination of PCR and clone-based DNA sequencing. Approximately 10% (12/118) of the patients aged 2-20 years remained negative for TTV including eight genotypes of SENV. Ferritin, aspartate-aminotransferase (AST) and alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) levels were invariably lower in TTV-negative patients (P = 0.02, <0.01, and 0.06, respectively) than in TTV-positive patients. Patients with TTV-HCV co-infection showed elevated ferritin and ALT levels compared with patients with TTV infection alone (P < 0.02 and P < 0.01). AST and ALT levels were within the normal range for all TTV-negative patients, whereas abnormal levels of AST and ALT were seen in a significant proportion of TTV-positive patients (30.7% and 33.6%, respectively) and patients with TTV-HCV co-infections (70.0% and 56.6%, respectively). Only TTV-positive patients (28.0%) and patients with TTV-HCV co-infections (36.3%) had hyper-ferritin levels (≥3,000 ng/ml). The genotype(s) of TTV responsible for the liver dysfunction could not be determined. However, high levels of AST and ALT were found to be correlated with detection of a higher number of TTV genotypes in the patients. The data suggests that frequent and persistent TTV infection through blood transfusion is associated with hepatic dysfunction and/or damage in transfusion dependent thalassemia patients. © 2007 Wiley Liss, Inc.

AB  - We recently identified a novel human virus classifiable into a third group in the genus Anellovirus, tentatively designated torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb and genomic organization resembling those of torque teno virus (TTV) (3.8 to 3.9 kb) and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) (2.8 to 2.9 kb). TTMDV was characterized by extreme genetic diversity similar to the TTV and TTMV genomes. Taking advantage of universal and virus species-specific primers derived from a highly conserved area located just downstream of the TATA box of the TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV genomes, a PCR method with simultaneous amplification of the genomic DNAs of these three anelloviruses in the first round and subsequent differential amplifications of these viruses in the second round was developed. High prevalence of TTMDV viremia was seen in adults (75/100 [75%]), comparable with the prevalences of TTV viremia (100%) and TTMV viremia (82%). Although none of 10 cord blood samples had detectable TTV, TTMDV, and TTMV DNAs, the prevalences of these three anelloviruses increased with the number of months after birth of the individual and reached 100% for individuals at one year of age. Dual or triple infection of TTV, TTMDV, and/or TTMV was seen in 10 (47.6%) of 21 infants 9 to 180 days of age and more frequently among infants 181 to 364 days of age (20/23 [86.9%]), comparable with the 93.1% (243/261) prevalence among subjects 1 to 81 years of age, indicating early acquisition of dual or triple anellovirus infection during infancy.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a recently discovered DNA virus that was originally isolated from a Japanese patient (initials, TT) with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. TTV is an circular DNA virus classified recently together with related Torque teno minivirus, into a new genus called Anellovirus. Infection TTV has been detected in a range of non-human primates as well as domestic animals. The purpose of this study was to search TTV in the serum and total blood of Brazilian monkeys and in plasma of domestic chickens by seminested PCR of coding region (N22), followed by a genomic sequence and phylogenetic analysis. No serum sample was amplified. TTV DNA was detected in total blood from 3 (4%) out of 75 brown-capuchin (Cebus apella) and from 1 (25%) out of 4 golden-headed lion-tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysomelas). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that one sample showed similarity with one sequence of the cotton top tamarin (Saguinus oedipus) (So-TTV2) and with one of the douroucoulis (Aotes trivirgatus) (At-TTV3). Two samples showed similarity with a human Torque Teno Mini Virus (TLMV). The other sample clustered with one sequence of the chimpanzee (Pt-TTV6) and with the human TTV strain TA278. The plasma chicken samples tested were all negative. The amino acid sequences reported in this study are the first obtained in Brazil from total blood of non-human primates naturally infected by TTV.

It has been classified into a new floating genus called Anellovirus. Recent studies showed that TTV can also be identified in serum specimens obtained from domesticated farm animals and from non-human primates. To better understand the relationship between TTV and their hosts, a study to detect virus in the serum and whole blood of Brazilian non-human primates and in the plasm of chickens was performed by applying the PCR-UTR-A technique, followed by a genomic sequence and phylogenetic analysis. By nested-PCR-UTR, the DNA of TTV was detected in sera from 4 (5.3%) of 75 Cebus apella, 2 (40%) of 5 Alouata fusca, 1 (20%) of 5 Alouata caraya, 1 (5.2%) of 19 Callithrix penicilata, 1 (4%) of 25 Callithrix jacchus, 1 (20%) of 5 Saimiri sciureus and 1 (25%) of 4 Leontopithecus chrysomelas. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that sequences detected in 8 samples clustered with TTV sequences So-TTV2 (Sagüinus oedipus) and At-TTV3 (Aotes Trivirgatus). Three sequences showed similarity with a human Torque Teno Minivirus (TLMV). TTV ORF2 DNA was detected in one sera sample and one whole blood sample of non-human primates and in one plasm sample of chicken. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the sequences amplified by the ORF2 region show no difference between human, non-human primates and chicken. This is the first report of TTV in brazilian new world non-human primates and chicken.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is frequently detected in humans, livestock and some companion animals. Very little is known about presence of TTV in Canadian livestock and the goal of this study was to evaluate the presence of TTV in swine and cattle using molecular tools. TTV DNA was detected and confirmed by sequencing in the plasma of 90.5% and in the feces of 60.3% of the animals tested in a single swine herd as well as 80.9% and 1.1% in the plasma of individuals from general Quebec swine and cattle populations, respectively. The impact of the TTV presence in livestock population for the agri-food chain should be further investigated. Crown Copyright © 2007.

AB  - The unassigned genus Anellovirus comprises viruses called torque teno virus, torque teno mini virus and the recently identified 'small anellovirus'. The length of their circular single-stranded DNA genome ranges from ~2 to ~3.8 kbp depending on the isolate analyzed. A very high genomic variability characterizes members of this genus. These viruses are present in human populations (including healthy individuals) at high prevalence (>80%) and are distributed worldwide without geographic clustering. Some variants have also been detected in animal species. To date, neither their significance for host health nor their mode of transmission have been clearly identified. Diagnostic approaches are mainly based on viral DNA detection using genome amplification techniques. © 2008 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Transfusion-Transmitted Virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded and circular DNA virus belongs to circuviridae family genus Anellovirus, discovered by Nishizawa in 1997. As the usage of common syringes is the known and most common route of the virus transmission, and because of increasing population of Injection drug users (IDUs) we decided to study infection rate in IDU population of our Society. Methods: In a cross-sectional study at Infectious ward of Imam Khomeini hospital, 60 IDU patients were studied. Blood samples were dispatched to lab in citrated test tube for Genome Virus isolation operation, using boiling method, then PCR assay performed based on their available primers. Patient’s information gathered by interview and questionnaire methods. Results: All of our 60 patients were men and their age average was 35.30(SD±9.68) years old. 26(43.3%) patients had positive TTV PCR and 24(92.30%) of them had prison history. 23(88.50%) of these 26 patients had positive HCV Ab, 17(65.40%) had positive HIV Ab and 8(30.80%) had positive HBS Ag. Of 60 study patients 48(80%) had HCV Ab+, 43(71.70%) HIV Ab+, 26(43%) TTV PCR and 43(26.70%) had HBS Ag+ Of 26 patients who had TTV, 34.60% of them had no contemporary sickness and 11.50% of them displayed clear sign of hepatitis (fever, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, RUQ tenderness and Icter). 34.60% of them had LFT more than Upper limit normal (45u/l). Time average of injection in 26 TTV patient was 9 years (SD±7.16) and the patient’s age average was 36.35%(SD±9.2). Conclusions: One of the most important route of TTV infection is use of common syringes, TTV infection transmission chance is less than HIV and HCV infection and is more than HBV. In regard to high prevalence of TTV infection in IDU population and because there is no comprehensive information about pathogenesis of this virus in addition to another way of transmission of the virus, the fecal-oral way, we must make plans and policies to decrease danger of transmission of this virus to health care workers, their families and other near relatives. © 2008, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Significant frequency of TT virus (TTV) infections and its unclear pathogenetic role are purposes for which investigators are interested in theme of spread of the virus. It is considered parenteral way of TTV spread, oral-fecal, droplets, vertical, by breastfeeding and other ways. The aim of the study was to estimate the risk of TTV infection by various ways and to asses the risk factors of infection. Material and methods. To the analysis were enrolled 55 patients, in 27 (49%) of them we confirmed TTV infection (polymerase chain reaction method with two primers sets). We analyzed frequency of infections dependence on risk factors vertical, parenteral, and enteral infections. Results. Disturbances in pregnancy or delivery were not connect to frequency of TTV infections. We're not confirming this frequency dependence on number of past hospitalizations but it was dependence between frequency of TTV infections and chronic diseases and mental-physical retardation of children (p = 0.077; p = 0.01). It was not confirming significant differences in depend on dwelling place. Children from worse social conditions were infected more often (p = 0.05). It was not significant dependence between frequency of TTV infections and breastfeeding. It was confirmed that in children of parents with chronic diseases and children with brothers and sisters with chronic diseases are infected more often (for mothers p = 0.054; fathers p = 0.04, brothers or sisters p = 0.062). Conclusions. TTV infections are more frequent in infants and young children exposed to often contacts with medical environment, children from poor social conditions and with chronic diseases in near family.

AB  - This paper reviews the impact of infections on the onset and clinical course of bronchial asthma. A just emphasis is given to the role viral infections, particularly rhinovirus infections, play in exacerbations, and that played by respiratory syncytial virus, suspected of triggering the asthmatic syndrome. The mechanisms of the immune response to virus attacks are explained, highlighting the asthmatic and allergic patient's weakened response, particularly in the perinatal period. Further stressed is a potentiating effect of viral aggression on the allergic response. The hygiene hypothesis and its lack of scientific consistency is detailed, at least as far as the role it seeks to confer on an unproven antagonism of the Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte responses. The current importance of research not into bacteria, but into bacterial products, including endotoxins, on the modulation of asthma and allergy is noted. Studies which, along these lines, show an environmental impact on genetic secretion in the phenotype are underlined. Also discussed in passing are several mechanisms which go towards explaining neutrophilic asthma - for many a contradiction, given eosinophila's stranglehold on asthmatic inflammation.

AB  - Background: The aim of the study was to assess Torquetenovirus (TTV) loads within respiratory ciliated cells and to verify the existence of a correlation between TTV loads and functional or structural ciliary abnormalities, in a group of children with recurrent or persistent pneumonia. Methods: Nasal brushing samples of 55 children (28 male) were evaluated for ciliary motion and ultrastructural assessment, as well as for detection and quantification of TTV. Moreover, presence and load of TTV within ciliated cells, obtained from 5 patients by laser capture microdissection, were determined. Results: The nasal samples of 47 (85%) children with persistent or recurrent pneumonia resulted positive for TTV (loads ≤ 2.1 "7.3 log10 copiesg total DNA). TTV were demonstrated also within microdissected ciliated cells. No significant difference between primary (11 subjects) and secondary ciliary dyskinesia (44 subjects) for TTV prevalence and mean loads were found. A significant correlation was observed between nasal TTV loads and ciliary beat frequency score (r ≤ 0.305; P < 0.05), but not between TTV loads and presence of abnormal motion patterns, in patients with secondary ciliary abnormalities. As expected no correlations were found between nasal TTV loads and ciliary motion analysis in primary ciliary dyskinesia. Conclusions: The presence of TTV in nasal samples demonstrates TTV ability to infect respiratory ciliated cells and suggests that these cells are potentially able to support virus replication. Moreover, TTV may behave in respiratory cells in a similar way to other viruses, that is, they disrupt the mucociliary escalator. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Introduction. TT virus was first found in patients with non-A-E hepatitis. The frequency of TTV infections is significant in all age groups. In diagnosis of infection PCR methods with different sets of primers are used. The aim of study. To investigate the frequency of TTV infections in infants and children aged 1-3 years. Material and methods. 55 patients aged 0-3 years were investigated. In each of them for detection TTV viraemia 2 primers sets were used: coding ORFI and non-coding region NC. We analysed dependence of frequency of infections on gender, age, body mass of children, number of pregnancies, birth body weight, Apgar score parent's age. Results. TTV infection (positive result at least with one primer set) we confirmed in 27 patients (49%). More frequent infection was confirmed with primers to NC region. It was no difference between boys and girls in frequency of infections. In infants TTV infection was less frequent than in children aged 1-3 years (p=0,04). It was no differences in frequency of infections depend on actual body mass, number of pregnancy, birth body mass, Apgar scale mark and parents age. Conclusions. TTV infections in infants and children aged 1-3 years are frequent. Corroboration of infection is most frequent for primers to NC region. The frequency of infections depend on children's age. © 2008 by Polskie Towarzystwo Pediatryczne.

AB  - Background. Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV) is a novel single-stranded DNA virus that was identified in patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of non-A-G type. Clinical significance of TTV infection was analyzed in Egyptian hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients. The present study attempted to clarify these issues in Egypt, particularly in Qaluobia governorate, a country known for its high endemicity of liver disease and hepatotropic viruses. Methods. TTV are determined in the serum of 60 samples obtained from HCC and liver cirrhosis (LC) patients and 30 healthy individuals. TTV DNA is amplified by nested-PCR with TTV-specific mixed primers derived from the conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region followed by digestion with restriction enzyme. Using the enzymes HaeIII, DraI, EcoRI and PstI, we are able to distinguish between the four TTV genotypes. Results. The positive rate of TTV detection was 46.7%, 40% and 36.7% among HCC, LC patients and healthy individuals respectively. The more prevalence genotype was detected in the positive serum samples was genotype 1 (35.7%) in HCC patients, (50%) in LC and (63.3%) in healthy individuals, Genotype 5 (21.4%), (25.5%) and (18.2%) in HCC, LC and healthy individuals respectively. Discussion. This study indicates that TTV is commonly present in adult patients with HCC and LC as well as healthy individuals. The most prevalence TTV genotype is genotype 1. It seems that the infection neither contribute to the severity of liver disease no to the causation of HCC. © 2007 Hafez et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widely distributed in the general population. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and distribution of TTV genotypes among blood donor candidates and multiple transfused patients in the Southeast region of the state of São Paulo, Brazil. TTV-DNA detection by amplification of a segment of the ORF-1 region, presented a prevalence of 11.9% in 270 serum samples from blood donors, of 46.2% in 18 samples from patients with coagulopathies, and of 31.8% in 15 samples from patients with hemoglobinopathies. When specific primers for the non-coding (UTR) region of the TTV genome were used the prevalences were 50.5%, 95.0%, and 82.0% for blood donors, patients with coagulopathies and patients with hemoglobinopathies, respectively. Positive samples from 49 individuals were sequenced and partial segments of 230 base pairs referring to the ORF-1 region of the TTV genome were used for the determination of their genotypes with the aid of phylogenetic analysis. The most frequent genotype was 1 (74.0%), followed by genotype 2 (26.0%). These data indicate a high prevalence of this virus in the populations of blood donors and transfused patients, providing further evidence for the role of transfusions as an efficient pathway in the transmission chain. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Since the first discovery of Torque teno virus (TTV) in 1997, many researchers focused on its epidemiology and transcriptional regulation, but the function of TTV-encoded proteins remained unknown. The function of the TTV open reading frame (ORF) in the nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway has not yet been established. In this study, we found for the first time that the TTV ORF2 protein could suppress NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner in the canonical NF-κB pathway. By Western blot analysis, we proved that the TTV ORF2 protein did not alter the level of NF-κB expression but prevented the p50 and p65 subunits from entering the nucleus due to the inhibition of IκBα protein degradation. Further immunoprecipitation assays showed that the TTV ORF2 protein could physically interact with IKKβ as well as IKKα, but not IKKγ. Luciferase assays and Western blot experiments showed that the TTV ORF2 protein could also suppress NF-κB activity in the noncanonical NF-κB pathway and block the activation and translocation of p52. Finally, we found that the TTV ORF2 protein inhibited the transcription of NF-κB-mediated downstream genes (interleukin 6 [IL-6], IL-8, and COX-2) through down-regulation of NF-κB. Together, these data indicate that the TTV ORF2 protein suppresses the canonical and noncanonical NF-κ pathways, suggesting that the TTV ORF2 protein may be involved in regulating the innate and adaptive immunity of organisms, contributing to TTV pathogenesis, and even be related to some diseases.

AB  - Purpose: Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a novel non-enveloped, single-stranded DNA virus with unclear pathogenesis throughout the world. Many studies were conducted to determine this virus in various body fluids and different primer sets have been tested for accurate diagnosis. This study aimed to collect data on the prevalence of TTV in serum, tear and aqueous humour of patients undergoing planned cataract surgery and to determine efficacy of three different polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Methods: A total of 72 specimens (24 each ofserum, tear and aqueous humour specimens) were collected from 24 patients (11 male and 13 female) having age-related cataract. The patients did not have any other ocular pathology. TTV DNA was investigated by three different PCR methods: a seminested PCR performed with Okamato's primers, a one-step PCR performed with degenerative Takashi's primers and a commercial real-time PCR system. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 20 (83.3%) of the 24 serum specimens by the one-step PCR and real-time PCR system. However, seminested PCR yielded a positivity rate of 25%. TTV DNA positivities of the one-step PCR and the real-time PCR system were 33.3% and 66.6% of the 24 tear specimens, respectively. Seminested PCR did not yield positive result in these specimens. From aqueous humour specimens, TTV DNA was detected in 3 (12.5%) of the 24 specimens only by the real-time PCR. TTV DNA positivity of seminested PCR was significantly low in all specimens. Conclusions: TTV DNA was detected in serum, tear and aqueous humour of patients undergoing cataract surgery, supporting the idea that this virus can be detected almost all of the body fluids but at different rates under various PCR conditions and primer sets. Using commercial real-time PCR significantly increased the TTV DNA positivity. © 2007 The Authors; Journal compilation © 2007 Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Ophthalmologists.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, circular, single-stranded DNA virus infecting swine and several other species. TTV is nowadays considered a non-pathogenic virus in all species where it has been found. In the present study, the prevalence of two distinct swine TTV genogroups in boar semen and sera was determined by a nested PCR method. Furthermore, association between TTV infection and semen qualitative and quantitative parameters was analyzed. TTV was detected in 74% of boar sera and 72% in semen. The prevalence of genogroup 1 in sera and semen were 64% and 55%, respectively, while lower prevalence of genogroup 2 was observed in both sera (38%) and semen (32%). Some significant associations of TTV infection on semen characteristics in boar genetic lines were observed, but qualitative and quantitative semen parameters obtained in studied boars fall into normal expected ranges. Therefore, TTV semen infection was not evidenced to be harmful for the studied qualitative and quantitative parameters of semen. The high rate of TTV in semen suggests that sexual route might contribute to the transmission of the virus. It is presently unknown if this potential vertical transmission of swine TTV implies any effect on female reproductive tract. This study also represents the first description of swine TTV presence in semen. © 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently, we identified a novel human virus with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, tentatively designated as torque teno midi virus (TTMDV), with a genomic organization resembling those of torque teno virus (TTV) of 3.8-3.9 kb and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) of 2.8-2.9 kb. To investigate the extent of genomic variability of TTMDV genomes, the full-length sequence was determined for 15 TTMDV isolates obtained from viremic individuals in Japan. The 15 TTMDV isolates comprised 3175-3230 bases and shared 67.0-90.3% identities with each other, and were only 68.4-73.0% identical to the 3 reported TTMDV isolates over the entire genome. TTMDV possessed a genomic organization with four open reading frames (ORF1-ORF4) with characteristic sequence motifs and stem and loop structures with high GC content, similar to TTV and TTMV. The total of 18 TTMDV genomes differed by up to 60.7% from each other in the amino acid sequence of ORF1 (658-677 amino acids), but segregated phylogenetically into the same cluster, which was distantly related to the TTVs and TTMVs. These results indicate that TTMDV with a circular DNA genome of 3.2 kb, has an extremely high degree of genomic variability, and is classifiable into a third group in the genus Anellovirus. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - A combined rolling-circle amplification (RCA) and sequence-independent single primer amplification (SISPA) approach was applied to four samples of human plasma and one sample of saliva from a cat. This approach permitted the characterization of nine anelloviruses. Most of them were identified as highly divergent strains that were classified into species of the genus Anellovirus. The smallest anellovirus described so far in humans was characterized (2PoSMA, 2002 nt; 'small anellovirus' species). Two highly divergent sequences belonging to the species Torque Teno Mini Virus (LIL-y1, 2887 nt; LIL-y2, 2871 nt), which clustered into a new phylogenetic branch, were also identified in human plasma samples. Finally, two genomes that are separated by a genetic divergence of 46% were characterized in the cat's saliva, one of these creating a distinct phylogenetic branch (PRA1, 2019 nt). These results highlight the potential of RCA-SISPA for detecting circular (or circularized) genomes. © 2007 SGM.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped human virus with a circular negative-sense (approximately 3800 nucleotides) ssDNA genome. TTV resembles in genome organization the chicken anemia virus, the animal pathogen of the Circoviridae family, and is currently classified as a member of a new, floating genus, Anellovirus. Molecular and cell biological research on TTV has been restricted by the lack of permissive cell lines and functional, replication-competent plasmid clones. In order to examine the key biological activities (i.e. RNA transcription and DNA replication) of this still poorly characterized ssDNA virus, we cloned the full-length genome of TTV genotype 6 and transfected it into cells of several types. TTV mRNA transcription was detected by RT-PCR in all the cell types: KU812Ep6, Cos-1, 293, 293T, Chang liver, Huh7 and UT7/Epo-S1. Replicating TTV DNA was detected in the latter five cell types by a DpnI-based restriction enzyme method coupled with Southern analysis, a novel approach to assess TTV DNA replication. The replicating full-length clone, the cell lines found to support TTV replication, and the methods presented here will facilitate the elucidation of the molecular biology and the life cycle of this recently identified human virus. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The in vitro replication of the Torque teno virus (TT virus) tth8 full-length genome and particle formation in a Hodgkin's lymphoma-derived cell line after transfection with cloned viral DNA were demonstrated. Analyses of the transcription patterns of tth8 and tth7 TT virus isolates in a number of lymphoma and T-cell leukemia cell lines indicated differential additional splicing events and intragenomic rearrangement generating open reading frames which could not be deducted from the genomic sequence. We also demonstrated the presence of rearranged TT virus genomes in vivo in sera taken from pregnant mothers whose children later developed childhood leukemia, as well as sera from control mothers. Control experiments using religated cloned genomic tth8 DNA mixed with cellular DNA did not result in such subviral molecules. These subviral isolates ranged from 172 bp to full-length TT virus genomes. Possible in vivo selection for specific rearranged molecules was indicated by the presence of one isolate (561 bp) in 11 serum samples. It remains to be clarified whether selected rearranged subviral components resulting from specific TT virus types may contribute to the initiation of disease. These data demonstrate new features of TT viruses suggesting possible similarities to plant viruses of the family Geminiviridae, as well as raise questions about the documented plurality and diversity of anelloviruses.

AB  - Since late 2004, the swine industry in the province of Quebec has experienced a significant increase in death rate related to postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS). To explain this phenomenon, 2 hypotheses were formulated: 1) the presence of a 2nd pathogen could be exacerbating the porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) infection, or 2) a new and more virulent PCV-2 strain could be infecting swine. In 2005, 13 PMWS cases were submitted to the Quebec provincial diagnostic laboratory and PCV-2 was the only virus that could be found consistently by PCR in all 13 samples. The PCR detection results obtained for other viruses revealed the following: 61.5% were positive for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, 30.8% for swine influenza virus, 15.4% for porcine parvovirus, 69.2% for swine torque teno virus (swTTV), 38.5% for swine hepatitis E virus (swHEV) and 84.6% for Mycoplasma hyorhinis, transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus (TGEV/PRCV) was not detected. Sequences of the entire genome revealed that these PCV-2 strains belonged to a genotype (named PCV-2b) that has never been reported in Canada. Further sequence analyses on 83 other Canadian PCV-2 positive cases submitted to the provincial diagnostic laboratory during years 2005 and 2006 showed that 79.5% of the viral sequences obtained clustered in the PCV-2b genotype. The appearance of the PCV-2b genotype in Canada may explain the death rate increase related to PMWS, but this relationship has to be confirmed.

AB  - In the last 30 years, tremendous progress in identifying transfusion-transmitted viruses such as HBV, HCV, and HIV in industrialized countries has been achieved. Currently, the residual risk of transmitting these viruses through transfusion is very low especially after the introduction of "minipool" nucleic acid-amplification tests. Despite these major technical advances, there remains a legitimate concern as to the transmission of other blood-borne infectious agents through blood transfusion. Among these agents are HBV mutants, occult HBV, and HCV infections, malaria, Chagas, West Nile, dengue, and vesiviruses, bacterial infections such as Yersinia enterocolitica, and tick borne diseases such as human monocytic ehrlichiosis, human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and Lyme and prion diseases such as Creutzfeldt and variant Creutzfeldt. Most of these agents are very rarely transmitted by transfusion in industrialized countries. However, an awareness of their possible transmission is essential for the control of spread of these diseases among the public by human-to-human transmission via blood transfusion. This review summarizes the current status of prevalence and diagnosis of these emerging diseases and also updates our knowledge on recently discovered non-pathogenic blood-borne viruses such as GB virus C and Torque Tenoviruses. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suspected transfusion-transmissible infections (TTIs) have been reported to public health (PH) in British Columbia (BC) since August 2002. The impact of PH notification of suspected transfusion-transmissible hepatitis C virus (TT-HCV) infection over the first 2.5 years and the effectiveness of HCV lookback (LB) and traceback (TB) investigations conducted by Canadian Blood Services (CBS) in BC were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Suspected TT-HCV cases reported to CBS in BC between August 28, 2002, and February 28, 2005, were analyzed. The incremental yield of plausible TTIs from PH-reported suspected TTIs was calculated. The effectiveness of LB and TB investigations was assessed with respect to the impact of improved anti-HCV donor screening, the number of newly recognized HCV infections, and the timeliness of initiating investigations. RESULTS: Nine of 553 (1.6%) investigations were initiated after PH reporting, yielding an additional 2 of 237 (i.e., 0.8%) plausible TTIs. Ninety-two percent of investigations with transfused units involved transfusions before implementing second-generation anti-HCV enzyme immunoassay (EIA) donor screening. Almost one-third of HCV-infected persons in linked investigations (i.e., LB triggered by a TB and vice versa) were newly identified. Recently tested, PH-reported cases incurred a mean delay exceeding 6 months until initiating a LB or TB investigation. CONCLUSION: PH reporting of TTIs and investigating transfusions after second-generation anti-HCV EIA donor screening identified few plausible TT-HCV infections. Many HCV-infected recipients or lapsed donors first became aware of their infection status as a result of CBS investigations. The current process of reporting suspected TTIs incurs significant time delay. © 2007 American Association of Blood Banks.

AB  - In the process of searching for the recently described small anelloviruses 1 and 2 (SAVs) with the genomic DNA length of 2.2 or 2.6 kb in human sera, we isolated a novel virus with its genomic organization resembling those of torque teno virus (TTV) of 3.8-3.9 kb and torque teno mini virus (TTMV) of 2.8-2.9 kb. The entire genomic sequence of three isolates (MD1-032, MD1-073 and MD2-013), which comprised 3242-3253 bases and exhibited 76-99% identities with the SAVs within the overlapping sequence, was determined. Although the MD1-032, MD1-073 and MD2-013 isolates differed by 10-28% from each other over the entire genome, they segregated into the same cluster and were phylogenetically distinguishable from all reported TTVs and TTMVs. These results suggest that SAVs are deletion mutants of the novel virus with intermediate genomic length between those of TTV and TTMV and that the novel virus can be classified into a third group of the genus Anellovirus. © 2007 SGM.

AB  - Autologous blood transfusion grew in popularity in response to the recognition of transfusion-transmitted HIV and a lack of effective screening. Laboratory screening and donor deferrals have decreased the need for autologous transfusion. The issue of banking blood that has not been tested or has been tested and found positive for serious infectious diseases raises ethical and legal issues that must be addressed by transfusion services, transfusion committees, physicians, and administrators. This article provides a summary of pertinent federal and state laws regarding autologous blood transfusion and a framework to assess the ethical implications of various strategies. © American Society for Clinical Pathology.

AB  - Many studies have reported the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in hemodialysis patients, but few reports studied the prevalence of TTV infection in peritoneal dialysis patients. In this study, we determined the prevalence of TTV in a peritoneal dialysis population in Taiwan and related its prevalence with history of blood transfusion, serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibody to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV), and serum aminotransferases (AST and ALT) levels. Serum samples from 47 peritoneal dialysis patients and a control group of 43 patients at health examination were studied for TTV viremia by using polymerase chain reaction. The rate of blood transfusion exposure (p < 0.0001), female gender (p = 0.001), younger age (p = 0.0014), and serum AST level (p = 0.012) were significantly higher in peritoneal dialysis patients. The prevalence of TTV viremia was not significantly different between peritoneal dialysis patients and the control group (23.4% vs. 37.2%). TTV infection was not associated with evident liver diseases in peritoneal dialysis patients, and the infection rate was not different between automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. There was no statistically significant association between TTV infection and age, gender, transfusion history, duration of peritoneal dialysis, AST level, ALT level, HBsAg, or anti-HCV seropositivity in peritoneal dialysis patients. Our results suggest that TTV infection is not associated with evident liver diseases, and there is no difference between TTV infection in healthy individuals and peritoneal dialysis patients. TTV transmission probably occurs via routes unrelated to peritoneal dialysis. Copyright © Informa Healthcare.

AB  - Infants born from mothers with multiple blood-borne viral infections are at risk of multiple transmissions. Whether the risk of transmission of multiple infections increases with the number of viruses infecting the mother is still unknown. The aim of this study was to describe the risk of mother-to-infant transmission of multiple infections from multi-infected mothers. Sixty-four pregnant women infected by at least two viruses among human immunodeficiency virus-type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis C virus, TT virus, and GB virus type C, together with their 64 infants, were studied. Maternal blood samples were collected in the third trimester of pregnancy and all infants were prospectively followed for evaluation of transmission within 3 months after birth and two times in the subsequent 24 months. Transmission of single and of dual infection from mothers infected by two viruses was, respectively, 10/40 (25%) and 5/40 (12.5%) and from mothers infected by three viruses 9/20 (45%) and 2/20 (10%). One (25%) infant infected by one virus was born from the four mothers infected by four viruses. Transmission of single or dual infection was not significantly associated with the number of viruses infecting the mother (P = 0.9) in the linear regression analysis. Present study suggests the absence of a synergistic effect from viral interactions toward mother-to-infant transmission of multiple infections and supports the hypothesis that transmission from multi-infected mothers is the result of the specific interaction between each virus and the host. These observations may be of clinical relevance in perinatal counseling. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - SEN is a newly discovered blood-transmissible virus. Among its variants, SENV-D and -H are most often associated with non-A, -E hepatitis. Very little is known about the risk of vertical transmission of the virus. By using polymerase chain reaction with specific primers for SENV-D and -H, we investigated the prevalence of SENV-H and -D infection, the transmission rate of SENV infection and clinical features of SENV-infected children in 89 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive human immunodeficiency virus type 1-negative mothers. SENV infection was found in 36 (40%) mothers, and SENV-D was more frequent than SENV-H infection (34/36, 94%vs 5/36, 14%, P < 0.01). No difference in SENV infection rates was found between injection drug user (IDU) mothers (17/51, 33%) and mothers with no risk for bloodborne infection (19/38, 50%, P = ns). SENV-H infection was found only in IDU mothers and mothers with HCV genotype1b. Both SENV-D and -H can be transmitted to the offspring with an overall rate of 47%. Vertical transmission of HCV does not facilitate SENV infection of the offspring. Among 17 SENV-infected children, none was co-infected with HCV. Maternal HCV genotype or viral load does not interfere with mother-to-infant transmission of SENV. Persistence of SENV infection was demonstrated in 100% of infected children after 1-year follow-up, but none had clinical evidence of liver disease. © 2007 The Authors.

AB  - The age-specific incidence of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is bimodal with peaks occurring among young adults (15-34 years old) and people older than 45 years. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is associated with only one-third of HL cases. This study sought to determine if Torque teno virus (TTV) might be independently associated with HL. The presence of EBV was appraised by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in lymph node biopsies from 46 patients (3-81 years old) with HL. TTV DNA was assessed by PCR amplification. EBV was detected in 22 (48%) patients. TTV DNA was detected in 24/46 (52%) patients, as well as in 12/20 (60%) control patients with lymphoid unspecific hyperplasia. TTV DNA was not significantly more frequent in EBV negative (54%) than in EBV positive (50%) nodes. However, it was observed that the group of young adults (15 - 34 years, n = 19) showed the lowest EBV frequency (21%) but the highest TTV occurrence (60%). This may suggest an involvement of TTV infection in the pathogenesis of HL in young adults. Further large population-based studies are required to confirm our findings.

AB  - Background and Purpose: Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), a recently discovered DNA virus, was first identified in patients with non-A to -G hepatitis following blood transfusion. Transmission is generally via the parenteral route but recent data suggest that TTV can also be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted in March 2005 and included 324 patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD) at 3 different centers in Tabriz, Iran. Demographic and clinical data were recorded. Blood samples for virological and biochemical tests were drawn simultaneously. TTV DNA was detected using semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. Serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase were also measured. Results: Overall seroprevalence of TTV was 9.3% (95% confidence interval, 6.1-12.5%). Prevalence rates of hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C virus antibody, and hepatitis E virus antibody were 4.6% (15/324), 20.4% (66/324), and 7.4% (24/324), respectively. Patients were negative for human immunodeficiency virus antibody. There was no association between TTV infection and elevated ALT levels. TTV-positive patients were significantly younger than TTV-negative patients (p=0.018). There was no significant association between TTV positivity and age, gender, duration of HD, positivity for hepatitis B, C, or E virus infection markers, and history of transfusion and transplantation. Conclusion: We observed low TTV prevalence and no association between TTV and blood-borne infections in our HD patients. TTV infection was not related to elevated levels of liver enzymes; however, the clinical impact of this virus need further investigations. © 2007 Journal of Microbiology, Immunology and Infection.

AB  - Background: SouthernTaiwan is a hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) endemic area. SEN virus (SENV) infection has been suggested as transfusion-related hepatitis. Two variants of SENV (SENV-D and SENV-H) have been studied in non-transfused children and transfusion-dependent thalassemia patients. Methods: Sera of 67 non-transfused children and 55 pediatric thalassemia patients with multiple transfusions were tested for SENV-D and SENV-H DNAs, liver function, iron status, HBV and HCV markers. Results: The prevalence of SENV (D or H), SENV-D, SENV-H infection, and SENV-D/H coinfection was significantly lower in nontransfused children than in thalassemia patients (22.4, 20.9, 5.0 and 1.5%, respectively, versus 67.3, 52.7, 40.0 and 25.5%, respectively, p < 0.001). The serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in thalassemia patients with SENV infection alone were significantly lower than levels in patients with SENV/HCV co-infection (p < 0.05), but not different when compared with those without SENV/HCV infection. SENV viremia was not associated with elevated ALT levels in thalassemia patients. SENV viremia did not increase the risk of HCV infection in thalassemia patients. Conclusions: SENV infection is high among non-transfused controls in Taiwan. Transfusion significantly increases the relevance of SENV infection. SENV viremia was not associated with the ALT levels in thalassemia patients. Copyright © 2006 S. Karger AG.

AB  - Objective: To clone the open reading frame 2(ORF2) gene of transfusion transmitted virus(TTV) Lanzhou strain and construct a prokaryotic expression vector. Methods: The ORF2 gene of TTV was amplified from the serum of a blood donor in Lanzhou region by nest PCR and inserted into vector pGEM-T then, after identification by DNA sequencing, subcloned to expression vector pET22b(+). The constructed recombinant plasmid ORF2-pET22 was transformed to E. coli BL21 for expression under induction of IPTG. The expressed product was identified by Western blot, then purified by affinity chromatography and used as an antigen for the determination of TTV-IgG antibody in human serum specimens by ELISA. Results: The homology of ORF2 gene of TTV Lanzhou strain to that of TA287 strain isolated in Japan was 99.3%. The ORF2 fusion protein with 6 histidine labels was expressed. Western blot showed specific reaction of expressed product with TTV-PCR positive serum. The ELISA result using ORF2 protein as antigen showed good accuracy. Conclusion: The ORF2 gene of TTV was successfully cloned and expressed in prokaryotic cells.

AB  - Human herpes virus 8 infection is the primary and necessary factor in the development of Kaposi's sarcoma, but is not sufficient per se to trigger the onset of the disease. In order to search for virological cofactors associated with the occurrence of the disease, we investigated the prevalence of active infection by two newly discovered viruses, hepatitis G virus and TT virus, among patients with classical Kaposi's sarcoma. Serum of 24 patients with Mediterranean Kaposi's sarcoma was investigated using polymerase chain reaction and compared with that of 68 healthy subjects. Cutaneous samples from patients with Kaposi's sarcoma and healthy subjects were investigated for TT virus DNA. No patient had serum markers for hepatitis G virus. TT virus DNA was present in the serum of 21/24 (87.5%) patients and 32/68 (47%) controls (p=0.002). TT virus DNA was present in the lesional skin of 5/18 patients with Kaposi's sarcoma (27.7%), but not in the skin of controls. TT virus might play a role as a cofactor in the clinical emergence of Kaposi's sarcoma in patients infected with Human herpes virus 8, perhaps by immunosuppressive effects or by a common transmission pathway for these two viruses. © 2007 Acta Dermato-Venereologica.

AB  - Torque Teno Virus (TTV) species-cross infection has been documented. However, the genetic relationship between human and animal TTV remains uncertain. In this study, genotypic characterization of TTV in different Camel specimens from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was undertaken for comparison with human UAE TTV. A total of 56 specimens: 34 sera, 14 raw, and 8 pasteurized milk samples were tested for TTV. The results showed that the rate of infection was, 38.2% (13/34), 35.7% (5/14), and 100% (8/8), for the samples of sera, raw, and pasteurized milk respectively. The 5′ untranslated region (5′UTR) of 23 clones that were generated from PCR products amplified from Camel samples (three sera, three raw, and two pasteurized milk samples) were subjected to sequence analysis. The camel TTV clones were classified as genotype 11 (47.8%), group 5 (43.5%), and SENV-H or genotype 16 (8.7%) which are among the predominant genotypes found in humans in the UAE. Phylogenetic analysis of representative sequences revealed that the similarity between isolates from camels and humans is 92%-97% for the same genotypes. The data lead to the conclusion that camels and humans share a common source of TTV infection in the UAE. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) and Torque teno minivirus (TTMV) are highly prevalent in the general population and although no disease has been associated with these viruses yet, co-infections with other pathological viruses are frequent. Both viruses are extremely heterogeneous, especially for DNA viruses, and the role of the immune system in controlling the infections has yet to be established. In this study the TTV/TTMV viral loads in HIV positive tissues have been investigated for the first time. The titers of both TTV and TTMV were compared in the bone marrow and spleen tissues from three groups: HIV negative individuals, HIV positive individuals and HIV positive individuals who had progressed to AIDS, leading to immunosuppression. Limiting dilution PCR using primers situated in the UTR region of the genome were used to semi-quantitate the virus, and TTV and TTMV were differentiated using melting curve analysis of the PCR product. The AIDS group had significantly higher titers compared with both the HIV positive and negative groups for both bone marrow (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.006, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001) and spleen (AIDS vs. HIV positive P = 0.022, AIDS vs. HIV negative P < 0.001). Analysis of TTV/TTMV titer with CD4 T lymphocyte count showed a significant inverse correlation however neither HCV co-infection or type of Anellovirus infection (single TTV or TTMV, or mixed TTV/TTMV) showed any significant correlation with virus titer. The results show a link between deterioration of the immune system and increased the viral loads in studied tissues. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV), currently classified into the family Circoviridae, genus Anellovirus, was first found in a patient with non-A-E hepatitis. TTV has a single stranded circular DNA of ∼3.8 kb. TTVs are extraordinarily diverse, spanning five groups including SANBAN and SEN viruses. Torque teno mini virus (TTMV) with ∼2.9 kb genome also has wide variants. Recently, two related 2.2- and 2.6-kb species joined this community. Recombinations between variants are frequent. This extensive TTV diversity remains unexplained; it is unclear how TTVs could be viable, and why they require such genetic variation. An unequivocal culture system is still not available. TTVs are ubiquitous in > 90% of adults worldwide but no human pathogenicity of TTV has been fully established. Epidemiological surveys need to specify the variants being studied and clinical targets, and must calibrate the sensitivity of the assay used. Potentially interesting observations include a higher viral load in patients with severe idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, cancer and lupus. Active replication was also found in infants with acute respiratory diseases. TTV/ TTMV-related viruses were found in chimpanzees, apes, African monkeys and tupaias, and also in chickens, pigs, cows, sheep and dogs. Experimentally, rhesus monkeys were persistently infected by TTV, but only 1/53 chimpanzees. TTV transcribes three species of mRNAs, 3.0-, 1.2- and 1.0-kb in the ratio of 60:5:35. Recently, at least three mRNAs were shown in chicken anaemia virus. The genomic region -154/-76 contains a critical promoter. TTV seems to have at least three proteins; however, the definite functions of these proteins await further research work. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widespread throughout the world and can be detected in 50-95% of healthy individuals. However, in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected patients co-infected with TTV, histological activity indices were higher than patients with HCV infection alone. There are studies which indicate that TTV can cause aplastic anemia and thrombocytopenia. While TTV is known to be transmitted through blood transfusions and by fecal-oral route, published information on transplasental transmission is controversial. The aims of this study were to detect the frequency of TTV infection among healthy pregnant women and to search whether TTV is transmitted transplasentally during pregnancy. For this purpose, plasma samples collected from 54 women and their newborns were investigated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and viral loads were determined for infected newborns, and their respective mothers. Also, ten mothers whose newborns were tested negative for TTV-DNA were enrolled in viral load tests for comparison. TTV-DNA was detected in 49 (90.7%) of 54 women. Of 49 newborns whose mothers were infected with TTV, only 4 (8.2%) were found positive for TTV-DNA. There was no statistically significant difference in TTV-DNA loads between mothers who transmitted the virus and those who did not (Mann-Whitney U analysis Z=-0.071, P=0.944). As a result, transplasental transmission of TTV is possible but occurs in low frequency and independent of viral load.

AB  - Recently, a novel virus designated SEN virus (SENV), which is thought to be related to posttransfusion hepatitis, was discovered. The aim of the present study was to investigate the prevalence and clinical significance of 2 SENV variants (SENV-D and SENV-H) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and healthy adults. Also, to investigate the possible effect of SEN virus on the humoral immune response against different proteins of HCV through analyzing reactivity patterns of the confirmatory INNO-LIA HCV Ab III update in relation to SEN viremia. We investigated SEN virus infection in 41 patients with HCC (25 males and 16 females) and twenty healthy blood donors (12 males and 8 females). All samples were taken from the National Cancer Institute, Cairo University. We used semi nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification to detect SENV-D and SENV-H strains in serum. All patients were tested against HCV antibody by ELISA and HCV viremia by RT-PCR. Furthermore, nineteen patients positive for HCV antibody by EIA (10 positive for SEN DNA and 9 non viremic for SEN) were confirmed in the immunoblot assay. SENV DNA was detected in 68 % (28 of 41) of patients with HCC and in 64 % (21 of 33) HCV-related HCC, in comparison to 5% (1 of 20) healthy blood donor populations. The blood biochemical parameters, and performance status did not differ significantly between the SENV DNA-positive and- negative patients. However, the overall survival rate was 50 % after two years follow up in SENV DNA-positive and 14 % in SENV DNA-negative HCC patients. Reactivity to NS5 and E2 were less (22 % and 44 % of cases) in SENV negative cases, than in SENV positive cases (70 % and 80 % of cases, respectively). In conclusion, SENV DNA seems to be highly prevalent among Egyptian HCC patients. Cross reactivity between SENV proteins and HCV NS5, E2 or the increased immune response in SENV positive cases and consequently the increased reactivity to HCV NS5 and E2 proteins could not be ruled out. Although there was no apparent effect of SENV on biochemical tests, survival rates of SENV DNA-positive HCC patients were higher thannegative cases, which might be due to other factors affecting survival in our Egyptian HCC patients.

AB  - In 1997 a novel virus in the serum of a patient with acute post-transfusion hepatitis of non A-G etiology was identified. This agent was designed TT virus (TTV). It produces persistent viremia and no disease, but the mechanism of its persistence is poorly understood. In the present study mRNA expression of antiviral proteins as MxA, 2′ 5′ OAS, anti-apopotic protein, cytokines IL- 28, IL- 29 and IFN are examined in a subject affected by B lymphoma and positive for TTV DNA and RNA in this cellular subset, and in BJAB and Dohh2 cell lines.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) infection is highly prevalent in general population and patients with hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. The aim of the present study was to determine the distribution of the genotypes and genogroups of TTV in healthy and HBV-infected individuals in Korea. METHODS: Distribution of TTV genotypes and genogroups was investigated in the serum samples of 69 healthy and 59 HBV-infected individuals. PCR products of N22 region were genotyped by sequence analysis. TTV genogroups were determined by 5 different genogroup-specific PCR assays. RESULTS: Among the 20 sequenced isolates, 9 (45%) were genotype 2, 8 (40%) were genotype 1, 2 (10%) were genotype 3, and 1 (5%) was genotype 4. TTV genogroup 4 was found most frequently (52/128), followed by genogroup 3 (42/128), genogroup 1 (35/128), genogroup 5 (32/128), and genogroup 2 (1/128). Mixed infections with different genogroups were frequent. CONCLUSIONS: TTV genotype 2 and 1 are predominant genotypes. TTV genotype 3 was detected for the first time in Korea. TTV genogroups 4 and 3 were predominant genogroups. No significant difference was observed in the distribution of TTV genogroups between healthy and HBV-infected individuals.

AB  - ◆ Background: Many reports have demonstrated SEN virus (SEN-V) infection rates in hemodialysis patients, but the SEN-V infection rate in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has never been reported. In this study, we determined the prevalence rate of SEN-V viremia in a PD population. ◆ Methods: Serum samples from 47 PD patients and a control group of 43 subjects from the general population at their health examination were assayed for SEN-V-D and -H viremia using polymerase chain reaction. ◆ Results: The proportions of female gender (p = 0.001), previous transfusion (p < 0.0001), and higher mean serum AST Level (p = 0.012) were significantly higher in PD patients. The prevalence rates of SEN-V-D and/or -H viremia were not significantly different between PD patients and controls (27.7% vs 32.6%). SEN-V-D(+) patients had lower mean duration of PD than SEN-V(-) patients. Mean ALT level was significantly lower in SEN-V-H(+) than in SEN-V(-) patients (12.8 ± 5.8 vs 19.6 ± 12.1 (IU/L), p = 0.025). None of the SEN-V-infected PD patients had overt clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease. There were no statistically significant differences in prevalence of SEN-V-D and/or -H viremia between automated PD (APD) patients and continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) patients. ◆ Conclusions: These results indicate that the SEN-V infection rate is not different between healthy individuals and PD patients. Infection with SEN-V is not associated with evident liver disease in PD patients and SEN-V infection rate is not different between APD patients and CAPD patients.

AB  - Stem cell lines used for cell therapy and regenerative medicine programs could be contaminated by several types of microorganism, such as bacteria, fungi, yeasts, viruses and prion particles. The presence of these pathogens makes the stem cell cultures unsuitable for transplant in humans. At the moment, tests for detecting these kinds of pathogens are carried out by means of standardized diagnosis procedures, in order to avoid the possibility of transmitting infectious diseases to the recipients of stem cell products. Some of the methods that can be included in a microbiologic control program are culture-based methods for sterility assessment, molecular techniques (PCR, RT-PCR), Ag detection and electron microscopy. However, new technologies based on DNA microarrays and protein arrays could also be applied for microbial diagnosis in stem cell lines in order to improve the microorganism detection. In this review, we summarize the main features concerning microarray methodology, the advantages and disadvantages regarding microbial diagnosis for stem cell cultures and possible future application in stem cell research centers in the microbiology field.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection (TT-CMV) continues to complicate blood transfusion therapy, which can lead to severe morbidity or mortality in immunocompromised or immuno-immature recipients. The biological mechanisms that underlie TT-CMV (eg, viral latency in donor monocytes or stimulatory signals in the transfusion recipient leading to cytomegalovirus reactivation) are difficult to study in humans, but can be addressed in animal models. In this review, we discuss a mouse blood transfusion model, which can be used to investigate these issues as well as to validate methods to prevent TT-CMV in at-risk patients. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The present study represents the first survey of Torque teno virus (TTV) prevalence in European wild boar (Sus scrofa). The prevalence of two distinct TTV genogroups in 178 Spanish wild boar sera from different geographic regions, management conditions, gender and age was determined by a nested PCR method. The overall prevalence of TTV genogroups was 84% (58% for genogroup 1 and 66% for genogroup 2), and differences between genogroup prevalence were observed depending on the geographical region analysed. Significantly higher prevalence for TTV genogroup 2 was found in fenced managed wild boar, juvenile animals and females. No other significant differences in TTV genogroup prevalence were observed. The phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences obtained from the untranslated region of selected samples revealed that the same TTV genogroups are infecting wild boar and domestic pig. The results indicate that TTV is apparently ubiquitous in European wild boar populations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - In countries with a high prevalence of blood-borne pathogen infections, transmission to infants commonly occurs from an infected mother during pregnancy. Maternal diseases caused by bacteria, viruses and parasites may sometimes be transmitted vertically. For many pathogens, several questions remain unanswered about the pathogenesis of vertical transmission, the relative risk associated with each mode of transmission, the rate of transmission from mother to child, and the factors that might contribute to the efficiency of transmission. There is also a need to quantify the contribution made by intrauterine versus intrapartum events. Here, the feasibility of some new emerging blood-borne hepatitis viral pathogens (hepatitis G virus, hepatitis SEN virus and hepatitis TT virus) passing through the placenta was analyzed based on a consideration of nonostructure level. Based on the particle size as a single factor, it is hereby proposed that the transmission of the studied viruses via the placenta is difficult. Possible infection due to other processes, especially intrapartum infection due to micro-trauma delivery, similar to HIV infection, might be a more important route of vertical transmission.

AB  - The emergence of new antifungal compounds with alternative mechanisms of action and improved tolerability has opened up new therapeutic possibilities for the use of combined antifungal treatment in life-threatening systemic fungal infections. A case report of an 8-year-old allogeneic stem cell transplant recipient who developed a central venous catheter tunnel infection caused by Aspergillus flavus is presented here. In spite of conventional and subsequent liposomal amphotericin B therapy the infection progressed rapidly and the necrosis extended further to the thoracic wall, pleura and the right lung. Combined treatment consisting of liposomal amphotericin B and caspofungin was instituted. After 30 days of dual therapy the deep fungal infection resolved and the extensive soft tissue defect showed scarring. One year post-transplant, the patient is well, with normal bone marrow function and full donor chimerism. Although there is limited clinical data on the effectiveness of echinocandins in pediatric patients with documented invasive fungal infections, this case report shows that combining liposomal amphotericin B with caspofungin could be advantageous. © Mattioli 1885.

AB  - Objective: Many studies have reported the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in hemodialysis patients but only a few reports have studied the prevalence of TTV infection in renal transplant recipients and none from Taiwan. In this study, we have determined the prevalence of TTV in renal transplant recipients and related its prevalence to history of blood transfusion, serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV) and serum aminotransferase (AST and ALT) levels in eastern Taiwan. Patients and Methods: Serum samples from 23 renal transplant recipients and a control group of 43 subjects at health examination were studied for TTV viremia using polymerase chain reaction. Results: The proportion of blood transfusions (p<0.0001) and HCV infection (p=0.048) were significantly higher in renal transplant recipients. Renal transplant recipients had higher mean levels of serum AST (p=0.013) and ALT (p=0.019) than the control group. The prevalence rate of TTV viremia was not significantly different between renal transplant recipients and the control group (34.8% vs 37.2%). TTV infection was not associated with evident liver disease in renal transplant recipients. There was no statistically significant association between TTV infection and age, gender, transfusion history, duration of transplantation, AST level, ALT level, HBsAg or anti-HCV status in renal transplant recipients. Conclusions: These results suggest that TTV infection is not associated with evident liver disease, and the prevalence rate is not different between healthy individuals and renal transplant recipients.

AB  - Oblective: To detect the transfusion transmitted virus-like mini virus (TLMV) sequence gene in patients with chronic hepatitis and to study the TLMV infection in population. Methods: Two sets of primers in the most conservative regions of Japan strains TLMV-CBD279 and CBD231 were designed to amplify TLMV templete extracted from sera of patients with chronic hepatitis B using PCR. PCR products were cloned into pGEMR-T vector and sequenced. Results: The results showed that 72% of TLMV sequence isolated in China was identical to that in Japan, suggesting that there was TLMV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B in China. The patients with hepatitis virus C and the healthy blood donor had the highest infectious rates of TLMV. Conclusion: TLMV infection exists in patients with chronic hepatitis B in China.

AB  - Context.-A novel human DNA virus was isolated from the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis; it was named transfusion transmitted virus (TTV). Objective.-To ascertain the influence of TTV (detected by polymerase chain reaction amplification of a conserved region of the viral genome) coinfection in individuals infected with hepatitis viruses (A, B, and C) and to investigate the putative role played by TTV in hepatic dysfunction in individuals with acute non-A-E hepatitis. Design.-Sixty-two patients with viral hepatitis were included in the study in addition to 18 blood donors. Viral study of 4 hepatotropic viruses (A, B, C, and E) was carried out. Study for TTV DNA was performed by nested polymerase chain reaction. Results.-The prevalence of TTV was not statistically different between hepatitis patients and blood donors, and it was not correlated to the levels of the hepatic aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase between individuals evidencing dual infection with hepatitis B and C viruses and healthy blood donors. However, in the group of patients with viral hepatitis of unknown etiology (non-A-E), those evidencing TTV viremia had statistically significant lower levels of alanine aminotransferase (P = .03) and aspartate aminotransferase (P = .04) than those who were TTV negative. Conclusions.-We can conclude that TTV is a frequent virus isolated from patients with various types of viral hepatitis, from cases of hepatitis without obvious viral agent, and from the healthy population. TTV has no effect on biochemical markers of associated viral hepatitis. It may be associated with a mild form of non-A-E hepatitis.

AB  - Pathogenesis of viral origin has long been suggested in autoimmune rheumatic diseases. Beside the well-defined virus induced transient or chronic rheumatic diseases often resembling systemic autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis, viruses can contribute to disease pathogenesis by several different pathomechanisms. TT virus is a recently discovered virus of extremely high genetic diversity which commonly infects humans. Despite accumulated evidence on the biological characteristics of TTV, its pathogenicity is still in question; many consider TTV as a harmless endosymbiont. The recent paper overviews the biology of TT virus and investigates the hypothesis that TTV might have a causative role in human diseases with special attention to the possibility that TTV might trigger autoimmunity in rheumatic disorders. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Two distinguishable modelling approaches exist for modelling the attitudes of travellers to the unexpected day-to-day variability of travel times. The direct approach sees the extent of travel time variability (TTV) as the variable that travellers react to, whereas the indirect approach claims that TTV effects are fully explained by trip scheduling considerations. Past research has not yet overcome the issue of which of these concepts is preferable, especially for public transport users. In the current paper, factors affecting bus users' scheduling behaviour and attitudes to TTV are investigated, based on a survey among bus users in the city of York, England. The survey methodology and its Internet-based design are described. The results confirm that the influence of TTV on bus users is best explained indirectly through scheduling considerations. The penalty placed on early arrival to the destination is found similar to the penalty on travel time itself; late arrivals are much more heavily penalised. Since the common treatment of TTV in practice is through models that ignore the effect of lateness and earliness, we also examine how using the simple approach rather than the correct one affects the economic interpretation of TTV; the results reveal a massive bias. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is prevalent worldwide in general populations but at present is not related with any, specific pathology. Its presence in faeces and its remarkable environmental stability suggest the possibility of using it as an indicator of faecal contamination in the environment. To evaluate the waterborne spread of TTV and its possible relationship with human pathogen enteric viruses, water samples were collected monthly for a year (May 2004-April 2005) from a river receiving the effluent of the treatment plant of the city of Pisa, concentrated and assayed with bimolecular tests (PCR, RT-PCR). TTV was detected in three samples (25%) while 16% of samples were positive for enteroviruses, 33% for rotaviruses, 8% for noroviruses genotype 1 and 25% for noroviruses genotype 2. Only two TTV samples (June and January) were also positive for rotavirus and norovirus respectively. The detection of TTV in water confirmed its possible faecal-oral role of transmission but data are still insufficient to draw conclusions about the role of TTV as a viral indicator. © IWA Publishing 2006.

AB  - In the aim of studying possible relations between viruses detected in clinical specimens and the ones found in different environmental matrices, in the period May 2004 to April 2005, the collection of faecal samples from gastroenteritis cases and the monthly monitoring of raw and treated wastewater, river water, seawater and mussels were carried out. The viruses considered for environmental monitoring were adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, norovirus, hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Torque teno virus (TTV): they were searched for with PCR and RT-PCR and confirmed by gene sequencing. Faecal coliforms and somatic coliphages' counts were also determined. The surveillance of case detected 45 positive faecal samples out of 255 (17.6%) while 35 of 56 environmental samples (62.5%) resulted positive for at least one of the considered viruses. The detection of the same viral strain in the faeces of gastroenteritis cases and in water was possible for adenovirus and rotavirus, which were also predominant in environmental matrices; thus they could be considered as a reference for risk assessment. © IWA Publishing 2006.

AB  - Sera of 426 adult persons were examined to assess the prevalence of SEN virus (SENV) infection in Slovakia and to determine the importance of different risk factors for parenteral transmission. SENV prevalence was determined by the PCR method using primers of SENV-D and SENV-H strains. Positive results were found in 10 of 37 patients with acute hepatitis of unknown etiology, 7 of 38 with acute hepatitis B, 17 of 44 with chronic hepatitis B, 29 of 102 with chronic hepatitis C, 36 of 72 hemodialysis patients, 2 of 33 health care workers and 24 of 100 persons from the control group. The highest prevalence of SENV was among hemodialysis patients, significantly higher than in the groups of health care workers, acute hepatitis B and controls. The lowest prevalence was in health care workers group, significantly lower also in comparison with groups of chronic hepatitis B and C. Among the possible risk factors of virus transmission the average duration of hemodialysis (1.15 vs. 0.50 years), number of surgeries (1.60 vs. 1.10) and transfusions (1.34 vs. 0.94) showed notable differences in terms of SENV infection. Bilirubin and aminotransferase levels did not differ between SENV-positive and -negative groups. No pathogenetic role of SEN virus in liver injury was confirmed.

AB  - In 1997, a new DNA virus, designated TTV "Transfusion Transmitted Virus", was isolated and seemed to be associated with non A-G post-transfusion hepatitis. The virus infects mainly patients at risk for parenteral exposure and hence, prone to develop chronic liver disease, as well as healthy populations worldwide. Few reports, however, have been published on the epidemiology and potential significance of TTV infection in patients with renal disease. This paper reviews, characterization of the virus, the history of its discovery, taxonomy and identification. Current status of TTV infection in patients with renal diseases are also summarised. © 2006 Elsevier SAS and Association Société de Néphrologie.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of torquetenovirus (TTV) infection in a group of children with recurrent lower respiratory tract infections and radiologic evidence of bronchiectasis. Correlations between TTV loads and severity of bronchiectasis and between TTV loads and lung function were evaluated. METHODS: In 38 subjects, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and plasma tests for TTV detection and quantification were done. In 21/38 subjects, spirometry was also performed. RESULTS: TTV was found in 31/38 (81.6%) patients. The correlation between TTV loads and severity of bronchiectasis was statistically significant (r = 0.548; P = 0.01). TTV loads showed inverse correlation with FEF25-75% (r = -0.541; P = 0.011), and FEF25-75%/FVC (r = -0.512; P = 0.018). Inverse correlation was found also between severity of bronchiectasis and functional lung parameters: FEF25-75% (r = -0.635; P = 0.002), FEV1/FVC (r = -0.541; P = 0.011), and FEF25-75%/FVC (r = -0.645; P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the high prevalence of TTV infection in children with bronchiectasis. Moreover, we have shown a significant correlation between TTV loads and airflow limitation within the peripheral airways, as well as between severity of bronchiectasis and decrease of lung function.

AB  - The present review gives an updated overview of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), a novel agent, in relation to its molecular characteristics, epidemiological features, modes of transmission, tissue tropism, pathogenesis, role in various diseases and its eradication from the body. TTV, a DNA virus, is a single stranded, non-enveloped, 3.8 kb long DNA virus with a small and covalently closed circular genome comprising 3852 bases. It was tentatively designated Circinoviridae virus. TTV genome sequence is heterogeneous and reveals the existence of six different genotypes and several subtypes. TTV has been reported to transmit not only via parenteral routes, but also via alternate routes. This virus has been detected in different non-human primates as well. At present, TTV is detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with no other available diagnostic assays. It shows its presence globally and was detected in high percent populations of healthy persons as well as in various disease groups. Initially it was supposed to have strong association with liver disease; however, there is little evidence to show its liver tropism and contribution in causing liver diseases. It shows high prevalence in hemodialysis patients, pointing towards its significance in renal diseases. In addition, TTV is associated with several infectious and non-infectious diseases. Though, its exact pathogenesis is not yet clear, TTV virus possibly resides and multiplies in bone marrow cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Recently, attempts have been made to eradicate this virus with interferon treatment. More information is still needed to extricate various mysteries related to TTV. © 2006 The WJG Press.

AB  - Due to technical improvements and new developments of immunological assays, the reliability of serological laboratory diagnosis of HIV infection has improved considerably and the residual risk, due to the diagnostic window for transfusion-transmitted HIV, has been reduced significantly. Through the addition of nucleic acid amplification tests (NAT) to blood donor screening, the residual risk can de further decreased by up to 50%, depending on the sensitivity of the NAT protocol and whether individual or pooled blood donations are screened. In-house and commercially available NAT have been implemented in blood banks as HIV only or multiplexed HIV and hepatitis B or C virus assays. As an alternative to separate antigen and antibody screening, combined fourth-generation assays have been developed in 1997, and have achieved a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. Thus, they can replace stand-alone antigen and third-generation antibody assays. While they are used in the routine diagnostics of HIV infection in many countries throughout the world, they probably represent no alternative for NAT in blood-donor screening in industrialized countries. In the next few years, technical improvements will further simplify NAT screening. While there is still some potential to improve the detection threshold of NAT, the sensitivity of the antigen module of fourth-generation assays (a lowest concentration of 3-5 pg of p24 antigen) is probably very close to its technical limit. © 2006 Future Drugs Ltd.

AB  - The existence of spliced mRNA in Chicken anemia virus (CAV) was investigated, as three proteins appeared to be derived from a single 2.0 kb mRNA species. Human Torque teno virus (TTV), which displays a number of genomic similarities to CAV, is known to transcribe three mRNA species, suggesting that CAV may also have multiple mRNAs. Northern analysis of infected chicken MDCC-MSB1 cells revealed a 2.0 kb mRNA 3 h post-infection (p.i.) and additional 1.6, 1.3 and 1.2 kb bands visible at 48 and 72 h p.i. MDCC-MSB1 or COS1 cells transfected with a CAV clone showed similar results. The poly(A)+ RNA of infected cells was subjected to RT-PCR using a suite of CAV-specific primers. The major 2.0 kb RNA reacted with every primer, but the 1.3 and 1.2 kb RNAs only annealed to certain primers. The 2.0 kb mRNA had no deletions or mutations and was capable of encoding all three known CAV proteins. The 1.3 kb RNA had a splice site joining nt 1222 to nt 1814 and encoded head/ tail viral protein 1 (VP1) without a frameshift. In addition, the 1.2 kb RNA possessed a splice site joining nt 994 to nt 1095 and encoded several putative, novel proteins with frameshift mutations. These splice sites conformed to the previously described GT-AG splicing rule. One further 0.8 kb RNA species appeared to be derived from a homologous recombination event. Discovery of the presence of spliced mRNA in CAV strengthens the similarity between CAV and TTV. © 2006 SGM.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The safety of human serum albumin (HSA) is of special interest with respect to virus transmission because of the wide use of this blood product as a therapeutic agent and also, added to other products, as an excipient or a stabilizer. Conflicting data are reported concerning HSA contamination by small, naked viruses such as the erythrovirus B19 (B19V) and the anellovirus torquetenovirus (TTV). This study has been performed to assess the effect of the HSA purification procedures on the viral contamination. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Known concentrations of B19V and TTV virus were spiked in raw Fraction V, the starting material from fractionated human plasma for HSA purification, which was subsequently submitted to the depth filtration procedure. After spiking, B19V and TTV genome copies were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction assays in the mixture at the end of Fraction V dissolution, to determine the virus concentration achieved, in the HSA solution after the filtration step, in the filtered postwashing fluid, and in the supernatant of resuspended Celite. RESULTS: B19V was completely adsorbed by the Celite used as a filter aid in the depth filtration process and was thus undetectable in the resulting HSA-containing fraction. In contrast, in 2 out of 3 experiments, TTV was detected in all samples. CONCLUSION: The different behavior of the two viruses might be a reflection of their different surface charge.

AB  - Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a parenterally transmitted hepatotropic pathogen. HCV infection is a major health problem worldwide, frequently causing cirrhosis and liver cancer. There is no preventive vaccine against HCV and treatment, consisting of interferon alpha plus Ribavirin, is generally effective in less than 50% of cases. HCV has evolved mechanisms for surviving in the host. Infection with multiple different HCV variants, as well as interaction with concurrent pathogens, might be successful strategies for viral persistence. The present review illustrates the current status of HCV co-infection with highly relevant pathogens. Issues regarding tropism, disease progression and antiviral treatment response, among other aspects, are discussed. Data accumulated reveal that HCV co-infection should not be considered the mere sum of several independent infections. Some significant questions are still unanswered. Therefore, nowadays, it might be more reasonable to face HCV co-infections as a new biological, clinical and even predominant epidemiological entity. © 2006 Academic Journals.

AB  - Anellovirus is a recently created, floating genus of viruses. Torque teno virus (TTV), the type species in the genus, was first discovered in a human patient with a post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. Recently, TTV genetically related to but distinct from those discovered in humans have also been found in animals, including pigs. The aims of this study were to estimate the prevalence of swine TTV in Italian pig herds and some risk factors possibly associated with this infection. Serum samples from 179 healthy pigs from 10 farms located in north-central Italy were tested by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of swine TTV DNA. Viral DNA was found in the sera of 43 pigs (24.0%), coming from eight of the 10 farms examined. Prevalence was significantly higher in finishing herds (40.1%) than in farrow-to-finish herds (11.0%) and did not depend on the size of the herd. Within the finishing herds the prevalence was significantly higher in weaners (57.4%) than in fatteners (22.9%), but this difference was not observed in farrow-to-finish herds. No relationship was observed between the prevalence of swine TTV and the implementation of some general hygiene practices and biosecurity procedures within the herds. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.

AB  - □ In hematology patients on chronic transfusion regimes, liver diseases are frequent, and mostly related to the agents transmitted by blood products and concominant iron deposition in liver. Besides hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses, new viral agents like hepatitis G virus (HGV) and TorqueTeno virus (TTV) are identified in these patients, although their association with any pathology or disease is not yet proved. In the present work, the authors studied the clinical importance of TTV in Turkish multitransfused patients with thalassemia. Forty-six healthy and 57 thalassemic patients were enrolled in the study. TTV was detected in serum samples by 3′-UTR nested PCR. Transaminase and ferritin levels, hepatitis B and C virus markers and number of transfusions were interpreted for possible association with TTV infection. As a result, TTV was detected in 63% of the thalassemia and 54% of the control patients. Prevalence of TTV infection, clinical features, laboratory data, and annual transfusion numbers of TTV-positive and -negative patients were not observed to be statistically significant. In conclusion, in Turkish patients with thalassemia, TTV infection cannot be considered as a risk factor for liver disease. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Introduction. Recently, the identification of the SEN virus as a possible etiological agent of parental transmission hepatitis led to the study of the prevalence of such pathogen agents, particularly SENV-H, in our population. This paper compares the rate prevalence in high-risk subjects, such as dialysis patients, and low-risk subjects, such as blood donors. Material and Methods. The study was carried out on SEN virus DNA extracted from serum of dialysis patients and blood donors, and the presence of viral genomes was performed by the nested PCR method. Results. The results showed a higher prevalence in male blood donors, supporting the hypothesis of an epidemiological role for sexual and also parental transmission, as is clearly demonstrated by the high prevalence in dialysis patients. The result reduced the importance of the possible etiological role of the SEN virus due to the high percentage of positivity in healthy population, and it induces one to consider poorly significant the pathogenicity of such viral agents. Conclusion. For this instance, the authors, in agreement with the phylogenically related TT virus, described SEN viruses as absolutely not pathogens and considered them as "simple guests."

AB  - Background: SEN virus (SENV) is a newly discovered DNA virus. We conducted this study to evaluate potential modes of SENV transmission and the pathogenic effect of SENV on liver diseases in children. Methods: Polymerase chain reaction was used to detect 2 SENV variant (SENV-D and SENV-H) DNA in sera from healthy individuals and diseased children. Nucleotide sequence of SENV was determined by direct sequencing. Results: SENV infection was assessed in healthy individuals, including 50 newborns (sera collected from the umbilical cord), 24 infants, 46 preschool children (aged 1-6 years), 42 school children of an age before that of the first sexual experience (aged 7-12 years), 62 adolescents (13-18 years), 72 young adults (19-30 years) and 32 adults (>30 years). The prevalence of SENV-D and/or SENV-H (SENV-D/H) viremia in each group was 0%, 17%, 24%, 24%, 27%, 33% and 40%, respectively. The prevalence of SENV-D/H viremia in 18 children with non-A to E hepatitis, 64 thalassemic children, 80 children transfused during cardiac surgery, 30 children with chronic hepatitis B, 9 children with chronic hepatitis C and 32 infants with biliary atresia was 11%, 61%, 80%, 83%, 67% and 50%, respectively. SENV was found more frequently in all patient groups than in 174 age-matched controls (P < 0.01), with the exception of non-A to E hepatitis (11% versus 24% in the control group; P = 0.27). In 2 infants with proven intrauterine hepatitis B viral infection, identical SENV-D nucleotide sequence existed in both the maternal and neonate serum. Elevated alanine aminotransferase concentrations were rarely observed in children who acquired isolated SENV viremia because of transfusion for surgery. Infection with SENV in children with chronic hepatitis C virus or hepatitis B viral infection was not associated with higher peak alanine aminotransferase values. Conclusion: SENV is transmitted mainly via nonparenteral daily contact and frequently occurs early in life. Transfusion can significantly increase the rate of SENV viremia. SENV does not appear to cause hepatitis in children. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - Objective: To report a retrospective analysis on the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) sequences in formalin fixed, paraffin embedded liver biopsies from eight patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, in comparison with blood markers. Methods: A direct in situ polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique was developed for the detection and localisation of genomic signals in the liver tissue. Conventional serological and molecular methods were used for blood evaluation. Results: In situ PCR showed the presence of one of the three viruses (four HCV, two HBV, and one TTV) in seven of the eight patients. In addition, a co-infection with HBV and HCV was detected in one patient. HCV and HBV sequences were located in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, respectively. When compared with blood markers, these findings were compatible with one occult HBV and two occult HCV infections. Conclusions: These findings provide further evidence for occult HBV and HCV infections in cancerous tissues from patients with hepatocellular carcinomas. In situ PCR could be an additional tool for evaluating the viral aetiology of hepatocellular carcinoma alongside conventional diagnostic procedures.

AB  - Introduction. TT virus (TTV) was isolated from the serum of patients with hepatitis. The clinical significance of the virus was not confirmed. TTV infections are frequent. TT virus can be transmitted by the parenteral as well as enteral route. Objective. The aim of the investigations was to estimate risk factors of enteral infection childhood and adolescents. Material and methods. 70 patients, children and adolescents, were enrolled on the study. TTV-DNA was assayed in the serum of patients. Results. In a rural environment, TTV infection incidence was more frequent than in an urban environment (53% vs 51%). A correlation was found between the number of siblings and risk of TTV infection: that risk decreased as the number of siblings increased. Conclusions. It was found that TTV viraemia was more frequent in children and adolescents with selected risk factors of enteral infections.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate the prevalence of swine Torque teno virus (TTV) in post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS)-affected and non-affected Spanish swine. Nested PCR (nPCR) assays to detect two distinct TTV genogroups were applied. A significantly higher prevalence of TTV infection was found in sera from PMWS-affected animals (97 %) than in sera from non-PMWS-affected animals (78 %). Whilst PMWS-affected pigs (91 %) were more likely to be infected with TTV from genogroup 2 than non-PMWS-affected swine (72 %), no such difference was observed with genogroup 1. Nucleotide sequences of nPCR products were 91-99 % identical between strains within a genogroup. In contrast, inter-genogroup sequence identities were 49-58 %. Phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that genogroups form different clusters without association with PMWS or porcine circovirus type 2 infection status of the animals. These results indicate a high prevalence of both swine TTV genogroups in Spain, being present more frequently in PMWS-affected animals than in non-PMWS-affected animals. © 2006 SGM.

AB  - The three HLA class II alleles of the DR2 haplotype, DRB1*1501, DRB5*0101, and DQB1*0602, are in strong linkage disequilibrium and confer most of the genetic risk to multiple sclerosis. Functional redundancy in Ag presentation by these class II molecules would allow recognition by a single TCR of identical peptides with the different restriction elements, facilitating T cell activation and providing one explanation how a disease-associated HLA haplotype could be linked to a CD4+ T cell-mediated autoimmune disease. Using combinatorial peptide libraries and B cell lines expressing single HLA-DR/DQ molecules, we show that two of five in vivo-expanded and likely disease-relevant, cross-reactive cerebrospinal fluid-infiltrating T cell clones use multiple disease-associated HLA class II molecules as restriction elements. One of these T cell clones recognizes &gt;30 identical foreign and human peptides using all DR and DQ molecules of the multiple sclerosis-associated DR2 haplotype. A T cell signaling machinery tuned for efficient responses to weak ligands together with structural features of the TCR-HLA/peptide complex result in this promiscuous HLA class II restriction.

AB  - TTV and TTMV (recently assigned to the floating genus Anellovirus) infect human populations (including healthy individuals) at high prevalence (> 80%). They display notably high levels of genetic diversity, but very little is known regarding the distribution of Anellovirus genetic groups in human populations. We analyzed the distribution of the major genetic groups of TTV and TTMV in healthy voluntary blood donors using group-independent and group-specific PCR amplifications systems, combined with sequence determination and phylogenetic analysis. Analysis of Anellovirus groups revealed a non-random pattern of group distribution with a predominant prevalence of TTV phylogenetic groups 1, 3, and 5, and of TTMV group 1. Multiple co-infections were observed. In addition, TTMV sequences exhibiting a high genetic divergence with reference sequences were identified. This study provided the first picture of the genetic distribution of the major phylogenetic groups of members of the genus Anellovirus in a cohort of French voluntary blood donors. Obtaining such data from a reference population comprising healthy individuals was an essential step that will allow the subsequent comparative analysis of cohorts including patients with well-characterized diseases, in order to identify any possible relationship between Anellovirus infection and human diseases. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The formation of heparan sulfate (HS) chains is catalyzed by glycosyltransferases encoded by EXT (hereditary multiple exostosin gene) family members. Genetic screening for mutations affecting morphogen signaling pathways in Drosophila has identified three genes, tout-velu (ttv), sister of tout-velu (sotv), and brother of tout-velu (botv), which encode homologues of human EXT1, EXT2, and EXTL3, respectively. So far, in vitro glycosyltransferase activities have been demonstrated only for BOTV/DEXTL3, which harbors both N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-I (GlcNAcT-I) and N- acetylglucosaminyltransferase-II (GlcNAcT-II) activities responsible for the chain initiation and elongation of HS, and no glucuronyltransferase-II (GlcAT-II) activity. Here we demonstrated that TTV/ DEXT1 and SOTV/DEXT2 had GlcNAcT-II and GlcAT-II activities required for the biosynthesis of repeating disaccharide units of the HS backbone, and the coexpression of TTV with SOTV markedly augmented both glycosyltransferase activities when compared with the expression of TTV or SOTV alone. Moreover, the polymerization of HS was demonstrated on a linkage region analogue as an acceptor substrate by BOTV and an enzyme complex composed of TTV and SOTV (TTV-SOTV). In contrast to human, TTV-SOTV exhibited no GlcNAcT-I activity, indicating that BOTV/DEXT3, which is an EXT-Like gene and possesses GlcNAcT-I activity required for the initiation of HS, is indispensable for the biosynthesis of HS chains in Drosophila. Thus, all three EXT members in Drosophila, TTV, SOTV, and BOTV, are required for the biosynthesis of full-length HS in Drosophila. © 2006 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.

AB  - As a result of immunological and nucleic-acid screening of plasma donations for transfusion-transmissible viruses, and the incorporation of viral reduction processes during plasma fractionation, coagulation-factor concentrates (CFC) are now judged safe in terms of many known infectious agents, including hepatitis B and C viruses, HIV, and human T-cell lymphotropic virus. However, emerging pathogens could pose future threats, particularly those with blood-borne stages that are resistant to viral-inactivation steps in the manufacturing process, such as non-lipid-coated viruses. As outlined in this Review, better understanding of infectious diseases allows challenges from newly described agents of potential concern in the future to be anticipated, but the processes of zoonotic transmission and genetic selection or modification ensure that plasma-derived products will continue to be subject to infectious concerns. Manufacturers of plasma-derived CFC have addressed the issue of emerging infectious agents by developing recombinant products that limit the need for human plasma during production. Such recombinant products have extended the safety profile of their predecessors by ensuring that all reagents used for cell culture, purification steps, and stabilisation and storage buffers are completely independent of human plasma.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the rate of infection caused by Torque teno virus (TTV) in United Arab Emirates' (UAEs) healthy population as a pilot study in detecting TTV DNA in 100 healthy blood donors. Methods: We randomly choose a total of 100 healthy blood donors who attended Zayed Military Hospital, Abu Dhabi, UAE from January 20 to May 30, 2005. We carried out a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect TTV DNA. Results: Real-time for TTV was positive in 75 ( 75%) donors. Eight (73%) non-UAE donors were TTV positive while 67 (75%) were UAEs. Among these donors, 72 (77%) were males and 3 (50%) were females. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated a high prevalence of TTV in UAE.

AB  - Background: In Saudi Arabia, the epidemiology and clinical significnance of Torque Teno virus (TTV) infection alone and in patients with hepatitis virus infections have not been determined in a single study. In this paper, we molecularly investigated the rate and genotypes of TTV infection among Saudi Arabian blood donors and patients with viral hepatitis. The effect of TTV coinfection on viral hepatitis was also examined. Subjects and Methods: DNA was extracted from the sera of 200 healthy blood volunteers, 45 hepatitis B virus patients, 100 hepatitis C virus patients, 19 hepatitis G virus patients, and 56 non-A-6 hepatitis patients. TTV DNA was amplified using primers derived from the ORF1 and 5′UTR regions. The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was determined for each specimen. Sequencing of ORF1 amplicons was carried out to investigate TTV genotypes. Results: Using primers derived from ORF1 and 5′UTR, TTV DNA was detected in 5.5% and 50.5%, respectively, of healthy blood donors, in 2.2% and 88.8% in hepatitis B patients, in 2.0% and 70% of hepatitis C patients, in 15.8% and 100% of hepatitis G patients, in 5.4% and 12.5% of non-A-G hepatitis patients and in 4.8% and 56.4% overall. No detrimental effect of TTV coinfection in viral hepatitis patients was noted. An overall prevalence of 4.8% and 56.4% was established. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most common genotype of TTV among Saudis is 2c. Conclusion: The rate of TTV infection among Saudi Arabians seems to be lower than that stated in previous reports on Saudi Arabia and in some other countries. The virus does not seem to worsen the status of those who are suffering from viral hepatitis infection.

AB  - SEN virus is a recently discovered DNA virus, and eight genotypes (A to H) were detected by phylogenetic analysis. Genotype D (SENV-D) and H (SENV-H) are thought to be associated in the etiology of post-transfusion hepatitis. Although no strong association was revealed between liver pathology and SEN virus, the viral replication in hepatocytes and transmission by blood transfusions were well characterized. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of SENV-D and SENV-H in blood donors. One hundred serum samples were included in the study which were obtained from blood donors comprised of 98 male and 2 female with a mean age 36.4 years who were enrolled at Mersin University Faculty of Medicine blood center. The DNAs of SENV-D and SENV-H were detected with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), by using D10S/L2AS and C5S/L2AS primers, respectively. SEN virus DNA positivity was detected in 25 of 100 (25%) sera, of which 10 (10%) were positive for SENV-D and 15 (15%) were positive for SENV-H DNA. Although, the number of samples were not sufficient to reflect the general prevalence, our study relatively reveals that asymptomatic carriage rate of these viruses were 25% in our province.

AB  - SEN virus (SENV) is a new, mostly parenterally transmitted, hepatotropic agent. The prevalence of SENV among patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis (HD) in Poland, as well as risk factors for the infection are not established. Serum samples of 91 patients receiving maintenance HD in Białystok were tested for the presence of strain H SENV (SENV-H) DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction. Fifty-one non-dialysis subjects, age- and sex-matched with the HD patients, mostly with chronic kidney diseases (96%), without hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) or the history of blood transfusion and donation served as controls. SENV-H viremia was prevalent in 40% of HD patients and in 2% of control subjects (p < 0.0001). On multivariable logistic analysis, neither age (63.1 +/- 13.2 years), gender (49% females), dialysis vintage (29, 2-200, months), previous transfusions of packed red blood cells (84%) or fresh frozen plasma (4%), seropositivity for HBs antigen (13%), HCV antibodies (23%) or HCV RNA (17%) were independently associated with SENV-H prevalence in HD patients (chi2 for the model = 13.3, p = 0.103). No associations between SENV-H status and clinical or biochemical markers of liver disease, including serum aminotransferases levels were observed. In conclusion, SENV-H viremia is widespread among patients receiving maintenance HD in north-eastern Poland. Risk factors for its occurrence are equivocal; the infection may well be transmitted by parenteral and feco-oral routes. SEN virus is not directly responsible for liver damage in maintenance HD patients.

AB  - The aim of the study was to assess the prevalence, clinical impact and importance of different risk factors of transmission of TTV infection in Slovakia using two PCR methods. Sera of 426 adult persons were examined. TTV DNA was identified by PCR using primers from N22 and untranslated region (UTR) respectively. The established prevalence of TTV tested with N22 and UTR primers according to patients groups was: acute hepatitis of unknown etiology 4 resp. 28 of 37, acute hepatitis B 3 resp. 29 of 38, chronic hepatitis B 11 resp. 41 of 44, chronic hepatitis C 10 resp. 93 of 102, hemodialysis patients 13 resp. 72 of 72, health care workers 0 resp. 27 of 33, control group 8 resp. 83 of 100. Using N22 primers, TTV infection occurred more frequently in chronic hepatitis B group compared with health care workers, if UTR primers were used the group of hemodialysis patients differed significantly from both acute hepatitis groups, health care workers and controls (p < 0.05). From possible risk factors hemodialysis and transfusion count showed notable differences. Bilirubin and aminotransferase levels did not differ between TTV positive and negative groups. No pathogenetic role of TT virus in liver injury was confirmed.

AB  - Titers of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV)-like DNA in saliva samples have been reported 100-1,000 times higher than those of the corresponding sera, suggesting viral transmission by saliva droplets. The present study was conducted to determine whether TTV-like DNA sequence elements play a role in the pathogenesis of cystadenolymphoma or pleomorphic adenoma and if the parotid or the submandibular gland is a major source of TTV persistence. Sixty-two archival salivary gland samples (16 cystadenolymphomas, 13 pleomorphic adenomas, and 33 controls) and 23 corresponding saliva samples were examined using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for TTV DNA. All PCR products that displayed DNA bands were sequenced. Leder's stain and immunohistochemistry (anti-CD8, anti-CD20, anti-CD45R0, anti-CD68, and anti-Ki67/MiB1) were applied to detect possible changes associated with findings of TTV-like DNA sequences. Tissue displayed TTV-like DNA sequences in 8.1% (5/62; saliva: 47.8%, 11/23). Tissue that contained TTV-like DNA sequences was histologically indistinguishable from samples lacking such DNA. TTV appears to be only a bystander in cystadenolymphoma, pleomorphic adenoma, and other salivary gland affections. Neither of the glands seems to be a major source of TTV persistence. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - Background: This study presents data on the prevalence rate of infectious markers among voluntary and replacement donors in the blood transfusion service in Armed Forces from 2000 to 2004. Methods: 39,646 units of blood were collected from donors during the period from 2000 to 2004. All the samples were screened for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1&2, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and by venereal disease research laboratory test (VDRL). Results: 24,527 (61.9%) were voluntary donations and 15,119 (38.1%) replacement donations. Prevalence of HBsAg had decreased, amongst voluntary donors from 1.67% to 0.77% but the positivity rate has not showed significant change. Seropositivity of HIV had decreased both in voluntary and replacement donors to 0.22% and 0.86% respectively. The seropositivity for anti-HCV showed steady decrease amongst voluntary donors from 0.46% to 0.20% in 2004, but in replacement donors, there was an increase in reactivity rate from 0.43% to 0.65%. Conclusion: The increased seropositivity for HCV, HIV and HBsAg could be decreased by introduction of nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) in minipools for HCV and HIV and introduction of anti-HBcAg (IgM) for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. But this may not be possible in near future in developing countries due to financial constraints. At present implementation of strict donor criteria and with use of sensitive laboratory screening tests it is possible to reduce the incidence of transfusion transmitted infections (TTI) in Indian scenario.

AB  - Viruses GBV-C/HGV and TTV were identified in patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology. Aim of our study was to assess the frequency of infection markers of these viruses in blood donors and haemophilia patients treated with virucidaly activated and non inactivated blood products. Material and methods. TTV DNA (by PCR using primers to coding ORFI and non-coding region NC) and GBV-C/HGV (RNA by RT-PCR and anti-E2 by EIA) were tested in blood donors (200 for TTV and 219 for GBV-C/HGV), 122 haemophilia patients treated in the past with non inactivated blood products and in 20 haemophilia children treated exclusively with inactivated clotting preparations. Results RNA GBV-C/HGV were identified in 3,2%; 23,7% and in 0%, respectively blood donors, adult and children haemophilia patients. Antibody anti-E2 were found in 23,6%; 37% i 25% of studied groups respectively. DNA TTV was detected most frequently by NC than ORF1 primers: in 78% vs.10% of blood donors, 100% vs 43,5% of adult haemophilia patients and in 95% vs. 15% young haemophiliacs. Conclusions Haemophilia patients were at risk of GBV-C/HGV and TTV infection. Following implementation of viral inactivation methods in the process of clotting factor concentrates production, the risk for GBV-C/HGV transmission was significantly reduced and in less extant for TTV.

AB  - The triggers of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS) remain elusive. Epidemiological studies suggest that common pathogens can exacerbate and also induce MS, but it has been difficult to pinpoint individual organisms. Here we demonstrate that in vivo clonally expanded CD4+ T cells isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a MS patient during disease exacerbation respond to a poly-arginine motif of the nonpathogenic and ubiquitous Torque Teno virus. These T cell clones also can be stimulated by arginine-enriched protein domains from other common viruses and recognize multiple autoantigens. Our data suggest that repeated infections with common pathogenic and even nonpathogenic viruses could expand T cells specific for conserved protein domains that are able to cross-react with tissue-derived and ubiquitous autoantigens. © 2005 Sospedra et al.

AB  - We investigated the characteristics and detection rates of SEN virus (SENV) infection among 100 Turkish patients who had with high alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase levels but were negative for HBV DNA and HCV RNA and had no history of transfusion. As a control group, we also analyzed 50 healthy individuals who had normal ALT levels, were negative for HBV DNA and HCV RNA, and had no history of transfusion. The serum samples of patient and controls were analyzed by PCR to detect the presence of SENV DNA and its two genotypes (SENV-H and SENV-D). We detected SENV DNA in 13 of 100 (13%) patients. Five of 13 (38.46%) patients were positive for SENV-D and 8 of 13 (61.53%) patients were positive for SENV-H DNA. We also detected SENV DNA in 5 of 50 (10%) patients in the control group. Two of 5 (40%) patients were positive for SENV-D and 3 of 5 (60%) patients were positive for SENV-H DNA in the control group. SENV was detected at almost the same frequency in the patient and control groups. SENV did not seem to contribute to the pathogenesis of liver disease (P > 0.05) in this cohort. Our results also showed that SENV transmission was not only associated with blood transfusion but also with some other possible routes.

AB  - Background: The TTV virus (transfusion transmitted virus - TTV) was isolated in 1997 from the sera of patients with hepatitis of unknown aetiology. The role of TTV in hepatitis is under question. The possibility of an association of the infection with diseases like aplastic anaemia, acute leucaemia, kidney diseases, infections and others is being considered. Aim: The aim of this study was an attempt to assess the influence of TTV infection on selected laboratory tests results and endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract in children and juveniles with recurrent abdominal pain. Patients: The analysis encompassed 25 TTV-infected patients and 45 noninfected ones. The patients were hospitalised at the Department of Pediatrics, Gastroenterology and Allergology, Collegium Medicum, Mikolaj Kopernik University, with recurrent abdominal pain. Methods: The results of: aminotransferase activities, blood courts, selected parameters of kidney function and results of endoscopic examination between TTV-infected and noninfected patients were compared. Statistical analysis was performed with Students-t-test and the U-test for 2 fractions. Results: There was no statistically significant difference between groups of infected and noninfected patients with regard to aminotransferase activity (AspAT 27.45 U/l vs. 26.23 U/l, A/AT 19.65 U/l, vs. 19.47 U/l). TTV-infected patients had significantly higher leucocyte counts in comparison with noninfected patients, but the remaining blood morphology parameters were similar between groups. There was no statistically significant difference between groups of infected and noninfected patients with regard to parameters of kidney function. The results of endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract were comparable in both groups. Conclusions: On the basis of the performed analysis it was confirmed that TTV infection does: not influence aminotransferase s activity; not influence kidney function parameters; not influence red blood cell parameters and platelet count; not influence the results of upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopie examination and that it can increase the white blood cell count.

AB  - Background: HCV was initially identified in 1989 when it was found to be the primary causative agent of non-A, non-B hepatitis,a condition associated with high rates of progressive and end-stage liver disease, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Since then, appreciation of the significant worldwide health impact of HCV infection has grown. HCV infection was identified as a public health problem in Cuba in the 1990s. Despite universal blood donor screening, which was achieved in 1995 using the Cuban immunoassay system UMELISA HCV, the infection is still found in multi-transfused patients. Objectives: To determine the magnitude of HCV, HBV and HIV-1&2 infections among Cuban blood recipients and to assess the role of potential risk factors. Study design: Cross-sectionalstudy of 318 patients from Havana City, Pinar del Río and Villa Clara, who had been previously treated with 10 or more units of allogenic blood or blood components in at least two different occasions. The patients were evaluated for HCV Ab, HBsAg, anti-HBc Ab, and HIV-1&2 Ab. Data management and statistical analysis were performed using EpiInfo and SSPS software. Results: Prevalence rates were 51.6% for HCV Ab; 5.3% for HBsAg; 45.0% for anti-HBc and 0% for HIV-1&2 Ab. Ten (3.1%) patients were co-infected with HCV and HBV Blood transfusion was not identified as the main risk factor for HCV transmission. The number of blood units received by the patients was not statistically associated with the HCV Ab prevalence. Conclusions: Infection with HCV was identified more frequently than HBV and HIV among our study population. Patients undergoing hemodialysis were at the highest risk of becoming infected. Medical procedures including surgery, transplantation, invasive odontology, and sharing or reuse of needles and syringes, are associated with higher HCV Ab seroprevalences compared with blood transfusion alone. © 2005 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Blood transfusions carry risks of untoward reactions, including the transmission of infections, such as hepatitis B and C. Proper blood donor recruitment and selection, and adequate laboratory screening for infectious markers diminish the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Objectives: To estimate the potential risk of acquiring transfusion-transmitted infections by hepatitis B or hepatitis C in 24 Caribbean countries during the period of 1996 to 2003. Study design: Official national reports for 1996, 2000-2003 of the yearlynumber of blood donors, screening coverage, and prevalence of serological markers for infectious diseases were used to estimate the risk of patients receiving an HBV- or HCV-positive unit of blood, and of developing an infection after receiving a positive unit. Estimates of number of infections transmitted through transfusion and number of infections prevented by screening of blood were also obtained. Results: During the period analyzed, HBV screening coverage among blood donors was 100% in all countries with the exception of Grenada (0% in 1996) and Saint Lucia (99.5% in 2002). For HCV, only 10 countries reported universal screening in 1996, while 15 did in 2003. The number of countries that did not screen any units for HCV decreased from 11 in 1996 to five in 2003. In general, high prevalence rates of HBV (10-75 per 1000 donors) and HCV (7-19.3 per 1000 donors) markers were found in the majority of countries. We estimated that 235 infections by HCV (1:12471 donations) and two infections by HBV (1:1465373) were transmitted through transfusion because of lack of screening. On the other hand, screening of blood for transfusion prevented 21 005 HCV and 22 100 HBV infections. Conclusions: Blood donor recruitment and coverage of screening for transfusion-transmitted infections, especially HCV, mustbe improved in the Caribbean countries. © 2005 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI) continue to be a problem in many parts of the world, and multi-transfused patients (MTP) are at a particularly increased risk of TTI. Objectives: to estimate the prevalence of TTI among multi-transfused patientsin Brazil, and to understand the epidemiological characteristics of TTI among these patients. Study design: cross-sectional study of 353 MTP, who were interviewed using a structured questionnaire and tested for serological markers of hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Results: the overall prevalence of HCV, HIV, HBV and co-infection among MTP were 16.7%, 1.7%, 0.8% and 1.7% respectively. A dose-effect relationship could be detected between the number of units transfused and HCV infection. Other non-transfusion related (NTR) risk factors for HCV did not confer any excess risk of HCV infection to MTP. Conclusions: HCV infection was the most prevalent TTI among MTP, and remains a major health problem for these patients.A dose-effect relationship could be detected between HCV and the number of units transfused. The implementation of measures such as donor education programs, standards for donor selection criteria, and of improved serological screening protocols, paralleled the decline in the prevalence of TTI, specially of HCV, observed in MTP, underscoring the importance of such measures for the reduction of the residual risk of TTI. © 2005 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The knowledge of transfusion-transmitted viral infections in Argentina is scarce. A regional study organized by thePan American Health Organization let us asses the current status. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of HCV, HBV and HIV infection in a population of multi-transfused Argentinean patients. Study design: Multi-center, cross sectional study of 504 patients from national referral institutions in Buenos Aires, who had received more than ten units of blood products in more than two occasions. Demographic and clinical data were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Blood samples were analyzed for a-HCV, a-HIV, HBsAg and a-HBcore. Results: Patients belonged to five diagnostic categories: onco-hematology (309; 61.3%); hemophilia (96; 19%); acute bloodloss (54; 10.7% ); hemoglobinopathies (35; 6.9%); and hemodialysis (5; 1% ); five patients (1%) had two of the previous conditions. Overall prevalence rates of viral markers were: a-HCV 9.3% (CI95%: 6.7-12.0); a-HBcore 4.8% (CI95: 2.8-6.7); a-HIV 1.2% (CI 95%: 0.14-2.2) and HBsAg 0.20%(CI95%: 0.2-0.59). The highest prevalence rates were found among patients living with hemophilia (PLH). There was a significant statistical association (p &lt; 10-5, OR =78.8 [29.7-209.7]) between a-HCV infection and having been transfused before 1993, when screening blood donors for a-HCV became mandatory in our country. The subpopulation of patients exposed to transfusion before 1993 was conformed mostly by PLH (70.9%) and hemoglobinopathies (18.6%). In this subpopulation, we found a significant association (p &lt; 10-4, OR = 40 [5.68-281.66]) between years of exposure to transfusion and a-HCV among the patients under the median age (21.95 years old); however, there was no association for those above the median age (p=0.111). Conclusion: a-HCV was found to be the most prevalent infection in the multi-transfused patient population under study. Most infected individuals were PLH, transfused before 1993. This study will provide support for further research aimed at improving blood safety in Argentina. © 2005 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Transfusion-transmitted infections (TTIs) constitute a major health problem worldwide where routine screening of blood or blood products is improperly done, and where non-medical injecting medications and/or drug use are prevalent. Prevalence and risk factors vary by geographic location and by the specific TTI (including HIV-1, HBV, HCV and HTLV-I). Objective: To determine theprevalence and risk factors associated with TTIs among a sample of multi-transfused adult patients in Peru. Study design: A cross-sectionalmulti- center study was conducted across seven major hospitals in Peru from February 2003 to September 2004. Self-reported behavior information (medical procedures, number of sexual partners, and drug use history) was analyzed, along with a review of exposure history from hospital medical records. Prevalences were calculated by TTI for different exposures, along with unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for infection risk. Results: Overall, 192 (54.7%) of 351 multi-transfused patients were found infected with one or more TTIs.Number of transfusion units, years of transfusion history (6 or more), and number of treatment facilities (2 or more) were associated with HCV infection. Hemodialysis history was a common risk factor associated with HBV, HCV and HTLV-I infection. HIV infection was associated only with total number of transfusion units received. Conclusions: High prevalences of HBV and HCV infection were foundamong Peruvian multi-transfused patients and were associated with a past history and number of blood transfusions, as well as with past hemodialysis procedures. TTIs continue to represent a significant public health problem in Peru. Continued vigilant attention to blood safety procedures, including universal screening and health care provider education, is recommended. © 2005 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - We investigated the prevalence and genotypic distribution of GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) and TT virus (TTV) in blood donors, mentally retarded children and four groups of patients living in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The prevalence and genetic analysis of TTV were determined by using the primers of the UTR and ORF 1 regions of TTV, respectively. Reverse transcription nested (RT-n)-PCR was used to amplify 5′ UTR of GBV-C/HGV. Genotyping of HGV was carried out by PCR-based genotyping assay while RFLP was conducted to determine the genotypes of TTV. TTV DNA was detected in 118 of 410 sera tested, giving an overall prevalence of 28.7%; GBV- C/HV-IGV-RNA was detected in only 17 cases, giving an overall prevalence of 4.1%. No significant differences were observed in the number of positive or negative tests for GBV-C/HGV and TTV according to duration of illness or mean duration of institutionalization in any of the groups studied, Although all samples from the study population belonged to genotypes 1 and 4, the most common TTV genotype is G2. In conclusion, our results indicate a low endemicity of GBV-C/HGV and TTV infection in Eastern Anatolia, Turkey. The presence of G2 strains reveals the limited genetic diversity of the GBV-C/HGV circulating in Turkey. We suggest that TTV infection of genotypes 1 and 4 is prevalent in the same region.

AB  - Background: The risk of transfusion transmitted viral infection is now so low that mathematical modelling is required to estimate the residual risk. The first national viral risk estimates for hepatitis B virus (HBV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) were recently published by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service. Using several refinements to the original methodology, as well as an additional 2 years of data, new risk estimates have been derived. Methods: Viral screening data for Australian donors for 2000/2003 were retrospectively analysed. The data were applied to three published models to estimate the residual risk of transmitting HIV, HBV, HCV or human T lymphotrophic virus (HTLV) by blood transfusion in Australia. Results: Applying the three models to HBV, HIV and HCV, three point estimates of the residual risk per unit were calculated for each virus. The median point estimates were 1 in 1 339 000 for HBV, 1 in 1 in 7 299 000 for HIV, and 1 in 3636000 for HCV. Although the HTLV risk could not be equivalently calculated because of the lack of incident infection it was estimated to be considerably less than 1 in 1 000 000 using a separate method. Conclusions: The most current and accurate estimate of residual risk of viral transmission in Australia has been provided in the present study. The residual risk in Australia is exceptionally small, continuing to decrease and is generally less than European or US risk estimates. These new estimates demonstrate that for viral transmission the Australian blood supply is amongst the safest in the world, and provide a basis for evaluating the cost benefit of future viral testing methodologies.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) has been reported from a number of hemodialysis (HD) units from various countries throughout the world. TTV has been associated with liver diseases, viral hepatitis B, and C. Clinical details and information regarding TTV prevalence from India are insufficient. The prevalence and clinical significance of TTV infection were studied in New Delhi, India in HD patients. Serum samples were derived from 75 patients on maintenance HD, and 75 age- and sex-matched voluntary blood donors were examined for TTV viremia by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers derived from UTR (A) region of the TTV genome. The prevalence of TTV DNA in patients on HD (83%) was significantly (p < 0.05) higher than in blood donors (43%). Clinical background including the mean age, sex, mean duration of HD, and mean alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels did not differ significantly between TTV DNA-positive and -negative HD patients. Fifty-four (72%) TTV-positive HD patients and 7 (56%) TTV-negative HD patients had blood transfusion histories (p > 0.05). Among TTV-positive patients, Hepatitis B virus (HBV) co-infection was present in 14.2% cases while hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection was absent. Persistent elevation of ALT levels was observed in 7(9.3%) HD patients; 3 (43%) of them were TTV positive and 4 (57%) were TTV negative (p > 0.05). All 3 TTV-positive patients with elevated ALT levels were co-infected with HBV. Patients with TTV infection alone showed normal ALT levels. Prevalence of TTV infection is high in North Indian patients on maintenance HD. Also, none of the exclusively TTV DNA-positive patients had clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease. TTV seems to spread through parenteral routes. More often, TTV seems to be associated with parenterally transmitted virus HBV, indicating a parenteral mode of TTV transmission. The pathogenicity of TTV remains unclear from the present study. © 2005 International Society for Hemodialysis.

AB  - Background and Objectives: To reduce the risk of transfusion-transmissible viruses entering the blood supply, the nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) was implemented to screen Scottish and Northern Irish blood donations in minipools. After 5 years of NAT for hepatitis C virus (HCV) and 2 years for human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1), the yield of serologically negative, nucleic acid positive 'window donations' and cost-benefit of NAT is under review. Materials and Methods: When the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) implemented NAT in 1999, a fully automated 'black box' system was not available. Therefore, an 'in-house' assimilated NAT assay was developed, validated and implemented. The system is flexible and allows testing for additional viral markers to be introduced with relative ease. Results: The HCV and HIV NAT assays have 95% detection levels of 7.25 IU/ml and 39.8 IU/ml, respectively, as determined by probit analysis. One HCV (1 in 1.9 million) and one HIV (1 in 0.77 million) window donation have been detected in 5 and 2 years, respectively, of NAT. Conclusion: The SNBTS NAT assays are robust and have performed consistently over the last 5 years. The design of the in-house system allowed HIV NAT to be added in 2003 at a relatively small additional cost per sample, although for both assays, the royalty fee far exceeds the cost of the test itself. Clearly NAT has a benefit in improving the safety of the blood supply although the risks of transfusion-transmitted viral infections, as reported in the Serious Hazards of Transfusion (SHOT) report, are extremely low. Also, in UK the yield of HCV antibody negative, NAT positive donations is far lower than predicted although the early detection of an HIV window period donation and the increase of HIV in the blood donor and general populations may provide a stronger case for HIV NAT. Summary sentence The yield of HCV and HIV NAT in UK is significantly less than that anticipated from statistical models. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV) is a non-enveloped, single-stranded, circular, DNA virus, first isolated from a patient with hepatitis of unexplained etiology. The much deliberated pathological role of the virus continues to be conjectural in the absence of a suitable in vitro replication model. So far, the liver and the bone marrow have been shown to be the main sites of TTV replication. In this study, the human cell lines HepG2 and Chang Liver, the rat hepatoma cell line MH1C1, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-stimulated TTV-negative peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) cultures and the B lymphoblast cell line, Raji were investigated as potential in vitro replication systems for TTV. The cell lines were infected with an inoculum prepared by pooling TTV genotype1 DNA positive sera and monitored for virus replication. Of the three hepatocyte cell lines, while the HepG2 and MH1C1 cell lines did not support TTV replication, the Chang Liver cell line showed clear morphological changes as a result of the in vitro infection, which included clumping and granular degeneration of the entire cell sheet over a period of 6 days. The infected cells also showed presence of virus-specific mRNA representative of viral transcription. The consistent presence of infectious viral particles in the supernatant culture fluid at 24-hr fluid replacement intervals indicated limited extra-cellular release of viral particles. The PHA-stimulated TTV-negative PBMC cultures and the Raji cell line were also able to support TTV replication and released significant levels of infectious viral particles into the supernantant culture fluid. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Fifty-nine children with well-controlled, mild to moderate persistent asthma were studied for the presence and load of torquetenovirus (TTV) in nasal fluid. Rates of TTV positivity and mean nasal TTV loads were not dissimilar to those observed in the general population and in a group of 30 age- and residence-matched healthy control children without a history of asthmatic disease. However, in the children with asthma, 3 important indices of lung function-forced expiratory flow (FEF) in which 25% and 75% of forced vital capacity (FVC) is expired (FEF25%-75%), forced expiratory volume in 1 s/FVC, and FEF25%-75%/FVC-showed an inverse correlation with nasal TTV load. Furthermore, signs of reduced airflow were more frequent in the children with asthma who had high nasal TTV loads (≥6 log10 DNA copies/mL of nasal fluid) than they were in those who had low nasal TTV loads (&lt;6 log10 DNA copies/mL of nasal fluid), despite similar therapy regimens. In contrast, the control children showed no associations between nasal TTV load and the spirometric indices. Levels of eosinophil cationic protein in sputum were also greater in the children with asthma who had higher nasal viral burdens than they were in those who had lower nasal viral burdens. These findings are the first report of TTV infection status in children with asthma and suggest that TTV might be a contributing factor in the lung impairment caused by this condition. © 2005 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

AB  - In 239 torquetenovirus-positive people, multiple-genogroup infections were common and associated with higher viral loads than would be expected from simple additive effects. The latter observation was restricted to the infections which included both genogroups 1 and 3, pointing to the possible existence of some kind of infection facilitation between these genogroups.

AB  - Objectives. The prevalence and clinical significance of two SEN virus (SENV) strains, SENV-D and SENV-H, was investigated among patients on maintenance hemodialysis in southern Taiwan. Methods. Sera from 99 uremic patients were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV), and SENV-D and -H DNA. Sera from 120 healthy blood donors were tested as a control group. Results. Of the 99 patients, 24.2 and 7.1% were positive for anti-HCV and HBsAg, respectively, and the prevalence of SENV-D and/or -H (SENV-D/H), SENV-D and SENV-H DNA was 61.6, 46.5 and 27.3%, which was significantly higher than for donors (23.3, 18.3, and 5.8%, respectively; all P<0.0001). Patients with SENV-D DNA had significantly higher mean age among both patients (P=0.019) and donors (P=0.015). Mean serum ALT levels were significantly higher among patients with anti-HCV (P=0.003) and patients with SENV-D and -H concurrent infection (P=0.034). By multivariate analyses, the presence of serum anti-HCV and concurrent SENV-D and -H infection were independent factors associated with increased ALT level. Conclusions. The prevalence of SENV-D/H infection is high among Taiwanese patients on maintenance hemodialysis with SENV-D more prevalent than SENV-H. The ALT level was associated with not only positive anti-HCV but also concomitant viremia of both SENV-D and SENV-H. © 2004 The British Infection Society. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Objective: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients produce autoantibodies to HRES-1/p28, a human endogenous retrovirus-encoded nuclear protein. To identify cross-reactive viral antigens capable of triggering autoreactivity, HRES-1/p28 epitopes were mapped by SLE antibodies. Methods: Forty-four peptides overlapping HRES-1/p28 and 13 viral peptides were synthesized on cellulose membrane and tested for recognition by antibodies from 16 HRES-1 Western blot seropositive SLE patients. Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) was detected by gene amplification in sera of 211 SLE patients, 78 healthy SLE family members, 199 unrelated healthy donors, and 91 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients. Results: HRES-1/p28 residues 41-55, 121-135, and 156-170 were recognized by 12/16 (75.0%), 11/16 (68.8%), and 9/16 lupus sera (56.25%) and considered immunodominant. HRES-1/p28 residues 121-135 harbor cross-reactive epitope with retroviral peptides and the 70 K U1snRNP lupus autoantigen. HRES-1/p28 residues 41-55 and 156-170 exhibited the highest prevalence of cross-reactivity with TTV peptide ORF2a (14/16, 87%). Prevalence of TTV DNA was increased in lupus patients (120/211) with respect to healthy (66/199; P < 0.0001) or RA controls (23/91; P < 0.0001). TTV prevalence in healthy lupus relatives (40/78) was decreased with respect to lupus patients (80/121; P = 0.0184) and increased with respect to unrelated healthy donors (66/199; P = 0.0026). HRES-1/p28 Western blot reactivity was observed in 12/23 TTV PCR-negative donors and 43/58 TTV PCR-positive donors (P < 0.0281). Conclusions: Increased prevalence of TTV and molecular mimicry with HRES-1/p28 may contribute to generation of antinuclear antibodies and pathogenesis of SLE. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A sequence-independent PCR amplification method was used to identify viral nucleic acids in the plasma samples of 25 individuals presenting with symptoms of acute viral infection following high-risk behavior for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transmission. GB virus C/hepatitis G virus was identified in three individuals and hepatitis B virus in one individual. Three previously undescribed DNA viruses were also detected, a parvovirus and two viruses related to TT virus (TTV). Nucleic acids in human plasma that were distantly related to bacterial sequences or with no detectable similarities to known sequences were also found. Nearly complete viral genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of a new parvovirus distinct from known human and animal parvoviruses and of two related TTV-like viruses highly divergent from both the TTV and TTV-like minivirus groups. The detection of two previously undescribed viral species in a small group of individuals presenting acute viral syndrome with unknown etiology indicates that a rich yield of new human viruses may be readily identifiable using simple methods of sequence-independent nucleic acid amplification and limited sequencing.

AB  - SEN virus (SEN-V) is a blood-borne, single-stranded, nonenveloped DNA virus. Although its prevalence varies by geographic region, it has been detected in as many as 30 percent of postoperative transfusion recipients, compared to 3 percent of postoperative patients who did not receive transfusions. A significant association has been observed between transfusion volume and the occurrence of SEN-V infection. Transmission by transfusion also has been confirmed by the detection of greater than 99 percent homology between SEN-V in donor and recipient sera. Concurrent infections with SEN-V and hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, or human immunodeficiency virus type 1 have been documented, and these observations probably reflect the blood-borne transmission of these viruses as well as SEN-V. Although SEN-V was discovered as part of a search for causes of posttransfusion hepatitis, there is no firm evidence so far that SEN-V infection either causes hepatitis or worsens the course of coexistent liver disease. Nevertheless, SEN-V appears to be transmitted by transfusion, and further studies may reveal more about its role in the future.

AB  - Background & objectives: The recent discovery of a novel parenterally transmitted, unenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus called TT virus (TTV) in chronic hepatitis patients with unclear pathogenesis throughout the world led us to investigate, its presence in chronic hepatitis patients attending a hospital in New Delhi, India, and to evaluate its role in liver disease. Methods: TT virus DNA was investigated in serum samples of 70 patients with various types of chronic hepatitis, and 100 healthy subjects from New Delhi, India by nested PCR using the primers that belonged to UTR (A) region of the genome. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 6 of 23 patients (26%) with type B chronic hepatitis, 3 of 20 patients (15%) with type C chronic hepatitis, and 12 of 100 subjects (12%) from healthy control group with normal liver function profile tests. None of the 27 non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis patients had TTV DNA positivity. The prevalence of TTV was significantly higher in type-B chronic hepatitis patients as compared to normal subjects (p< 0.05) but comparable to type C chronic hepatitis patients. The clinical course and biochemical profiles of type B, or type C chronic hepatitis patients co-infected with TTV did not differ significantly from those without TTV infection. Interpretation & conclusions: Interestingly, in chronic hepatitis patients, TTV was always associated with either hepatitis B or C virus indicating a likely parenteral route of transmission. All TTV-positive subjects in healthy control group showed normal clinical and biochemical profiles. Thus, the presence of TTV infection is unlikely to influence the course of chronic hepatitis related to hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) or cause liver diseases in healthy subjects.

AB  - Although most cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are associated with either the hepatitis B or C viruses (HBV, HCV), about 10-20% of HCCs occur in patients with chronic hepatitis that is aetiologically undefined. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of the transfusion-transmitted SEN virus (SEN-V) in patients with HCC, including those patients who do not otherwise appear to be infected with HBV or HCV. Fragments of SEN-V subtypes D and H were amplified separately by PCR from the sera of 50 patients with HCC (31 from Canada and 19 from Japan) as well as from HCC and adjacent nontumourous liver tissues from eight of the Canadian patients. SEN-V DNA was found in the serum of 10 of 31 (32%) Canadian patients and eight of 19 (42%) Japanese patients [overall, 18 of 50 (36%) HCC patients]. SEN-V DNA was detected in the serum of 10 of 23 (43%) HCC patients with antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), six of 11 (55%) with hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and two of 16 (12%) without detectable anti-HCV or HBsAg. Twenty-three HCC patients in this study had 'silent HBV,' characterized by the detection of HBV DNA in the absence of HBsAg; eight of these (35%) also had SEN-V infections. SEN-V DNA was detected in HCC patients most typically in those with coexistent HBV or HCV infection. SEN-V was found in only one of seven HCC patients without HBV (without HBsAg or HBV DNA) or HCV and thus does not appear to be an important cause of 'cryptogenic' HCC. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Calculation of viral residual risk is dependent on estimating incidence, which is not easily obtainable by most blood centers. Prevalence, however, is readily available. Understanding whether prevalence reflects corresponding incidence may help blood centers monitor disease risks. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: With data on 12 million allogeneic donations, prevalence and incidence of transfusion-transmitted viral infections (TTVIs) were calculated. Relationships between prevalence (in total, first-time, and repeat donations) and incidence were analyzed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV) relative to temporal and donor demographic stratifications, respectively. RESULTS: Overall prevalence of HIV, HBV, and HCV did not consistently reflect corresponding incidence. The relationship between prevalence and incidence varied with time and donors' age and was virus-specific. CONCLUSION: Incidence of TTVIs cannot be easily predicted from overall prevalence. Accurate assessment of TTVI risk necessitates knowledge about donation histories and person-years at risk. Establishing comprehensive frameworks for monitoring blood donations and infectious disease markers remains a key to monitoring blood safety.

AB  - Background: The pathogenic role of TT virus (TTV) is not clear in patients with chronic hepatitis B. The aims of the present study were to determine the frequency of TTV positivity in serum and saliva samples and the possible role of TTV in children with chronic hepatitis B. Methods: Sera and saliva from 29 healthy children and 25 children with chronic hepatitis B were tested for TTV-DNA by means of real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Results: Fifty-two percent (13/25) of the serum samples and 32% (8/25) of the saliva samples were positive for TTV-DNA in children with chronic hepatitis B. In healthy non-transfused children, TTV-DNA was detected in 58% (17/29) of the serum samples and 41% (12/29) of the saliva samples. Six (46%) of 13 children with chronic hepatitis and 10 (59%) of 17 healthy children had TTV-DNA positivity both in serum and saliva samples. Two serum samples were negative for TTV-DNA while the saliva samples were positive for TTV-DNA in chronic hepatitis B and control groups. Mean age, sex, serum alanine aminotransferase levels, hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA values were similar in TTV-positive and -negative children with chronic hepatitis B. However, total histologic activity index (HAI), periportal necrosis and portal inflammation scores were significantly higher in children with HBV-DNA and TTV-DNA viremia (P = 0.013, P = 0.008, P = 0.015, respectively). Conclusions: Because total HAI, periportal necrosis and portal inflammation scores were higher in children with TTV coinfection, TTV infection may contribute to the progression of liver damage in children with chronic hepatitis B.

AB  - Frequent infections in early childhood, whole-day care and a socially unprivileged environment have been reported as protective factors for childhood leukemias and lymphomas. Conversely, a protected social environment, higher level of education and growing up in families with a low number of children are considered as risk factors. Additional risk factors involve agricultural occupation of the parents and exposure to several other occupational factors. These data led to a number of hypotheses that attempted to explain the epidemiologic observations; however, a number of questions are still open. Here we propose a new concept that could explain most of the epidemiologic characteristics. This concept is based on the assumption that persistent infections with TT virus-like agents increase the risk for specific chromosomal translocations. This risk should correlate with the viral load. Interferon induction by intermittent infections should reduce the viral load and thus decrease the risk for chromosomal modifications. Some virologic observations in support of this model are presented. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first isolated in 1997 from the patient with acute post-transfusion hepatitis. This fact led to the conclusion that the virus was hepatotropic and could be one of the causative agents of acute hepatitis. Afterwards, however, the virus was found in other human tissues and serological studies revealed that it was widespread. Multiple tropisms of TTV and the fact of its high incidence in general population are considered to indicate no medical significance of TTV in human pathology. Here we present a report of two cases of TTV infection in patients who developed pancreas cancer. The patients were hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases due to hepatitis of unknown origin. Since serological and virological markers of common primary and secondary hepatotropic viruses were negative, TTV-DNA was found in serum and was believed to be the only causative agent with probable hepatotropic action. The patients later developed pancreas cancer and they underwent operation. The relationship is difficult to confirm, however the cases we present should be treated as a preliminary report and a comment on the real role of TTV in human pathology. © 2005 The WJG Press and Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Multiply primed rolling-circle amplification is a novel technology that uses bacteriophage phi29 DNA polymerase to amplify circular DNA molecules, without the need for prior knowledge of their sequences. In an attempt to detect Torque teno virus (TTV), rolling-circle amplification was used to amplify DNA extracted from eight human and four pig serum samples. All samples gave high molecular weight (>30 kb) amplification products. By restriction endonuclease digestion, these products generated DNA fragments whose sizes were consistent with those of human TTV (3.8 kb) and swine TTV (Sd-TTV; 2.9 kb) genomes. Two TTV isolates derived from a single AIDS patient, as well as two Sd-TTV isolates derived from a single pig, were characterized by complete nucleotide sequencing. One of the Sd-TTV isolates showed very low (43-45 %) nucleotide sequence similarity to the other Sd-TTV isolate and to the prototype isolate Sd-TTV31, and could be considered the prototype of a novel genogroup. © 2005 SGM.

AB  - The occurrence of human enteric viruses in surface water in the Tamagawa River, Japan, was surveyed for 1 year, from April 2003 to March 2004. Sixty-four samples were collected from six sites along the river, and 500 ml of the sample was concentrated using the cation-coated filter method, which was developed in our previous study. This method showed recovery yields of 56% ± 32% (n = 37) for surface water samples inoculated with polioviruses. More than one kind of tested virus was detected in 43 (67%) of 64 samples by TaqMan PCR. Noroviruses and adenoviruses were detected in a high positive ratio; 34 (53%), 28 (44%), and 29 (45%) of 64 samples were positive for norovirus genotype 1 and genotype 2 and adenoviruses, respectively. The mean concentrations of norovirus genotype 1 or genotype 2 determined by real-time PCR were 0.087 and 0.61 genome/ml, respectively, showing much higher values in winter (0.21 genome/ml for genotype 1 and 2.3 genomes/ml for genotype 2). Enteroviruses were detected by both direct PCR (6 of 64 samples; 9%) and cell culture PCR (2 of 64 samples; 3%). Torque teno viruses, emerging hepatitis viruses, were also isolated in three samples (5%). The concentration of total coliforms and the presence of F-specific phages showed a high correlation with the presence of viruses, which suggested that the simultaneous use of total coliforms and F-specific phages as indicators of surface water may work to monitor viral contamination.

AB  - Goals: This study was aimed at obtaining data on the epidemiology and clinical course of TT virus (TTV) infections among Indian subjects. Background: The TTV is a nonenveloped DNA virus, first identified in the peripheral blood of individuals with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. There has been much conjecture regarding the disease association of this virus. Study: A total of 494 serum specimens from various groups of high-risk and control subjects were screened for TTV DNA by a semi-nested PCR, using the ORF1-derived N22 primers. The sera were also screened for the HBsAg surface antigen by an ELISA, HCV RNA by a 5′ NCR-based RT-PCR and GBV-C/HGV RNA by a 5′ UTR-based RT-PCR. The clinical and hepatic profiles of the various subjects were also studied. Seventy-one randomly picked TTV isolates were directly sequenced and their phylogeny was studied. Results: TTV showed an overall positivity rate of 45.34% with a significant higher prevalence of 52.9% among the high-risk subjects as against a prevalence of 28% among healthy control subjects (P < 0.001). Abnormal liver function profiles were frequent among TTV viremic individuals and among the acute hepatitis cases studied a higher mortality rate correlated with a superimposed TTV infection. The 71 TTV isolates sequenced were found to belong to genotype 1a being closely homologous to TTV prototype TA278. Conclusion: The TT virus shows a significant prevalence in the Indian population, particularly among subjects at risk for acquiring parenterally transmitted infections. Our study corroborates a putative role of the virus in the etiology of liver disease, particularly in coinfection with other agents. Copyright © 2005 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - The expression profile of the circovirus TTV has not yet been fully characterized. In this paper, we show that following transfection of a full-length viral clone of TTV genotype 6, each of the three virally encoded mRNAs is translated from two initiating AUGs, and therefore, the TTV genome generates at least six proteins. Localization studies of hemagglutinin-tagged versions of these proteins in fixed cells, and green fluorescent protein-tagged versions of these proteins in living cells, expressed following transfection, demonstrated that two were primarily nuclear, two were primarily cytoplasmic, and two were found throughout the cell.

AB  - Background: The aetiology and factors leading to the progression of laryngeal cancer are still unclear. Although human papillomavirus (HPV) has been suggested to play a role, reports concerning the effect of HPV infection on tumour development are controversial. Recently, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) was suggested to play a role in certain infections as a causative or coinfecting agent. Aims: To investigate whether the development and progression of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is associated with coinfection with TTV and HPV. Methods: The prevalence of TTV and HPV was investigated using the polymerase chain reaction in tissue samples from 40 healthy individuals, 10 patients with recurrent papillomatosis, five patients with papillomatosis with malignant transformation, and 25 patients with laryngeal carcinoma. The obtained prevalence data were compared and analysed statistically. Results: In the 11 patients with carcinoma who had metastasis or relapse there was a high rate of coinfection with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV (eight of 11), whereas in the 14 without tumour progression no coinfection was found. Coinfection was associated with significantly lower tumour free survival in patients with carcinoma (p < 0.001). Furthermore, four of five patients who had papillomatosis with malignant transformation were coinfected with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV. Conclusions: Although the nature of cooperation between HPV and TTV needs to be investigated further, coinfection with genogroup 1 TTV and HPV appears to be associated with poor clinical outcome in laryngeal cancer.

AB  - Ever since the first outbreaks of hepatitis in hemodialysis units in the late 1960s, a number of hepatotropic viruses transmitted by blood and other body fluids have been identified. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding these blood-borne agents from an epedemiologic and preventive perspective. Data source and study selection were obtained from research and review articles related to the epidemiology of viral hepatitis in hemodialysis and indexed on Medline and Embase from 1965 to 2004. Hepatitis B virus (HBV) was the first significant hepatotropic virus to be identified in hemodialysis centers. HBV infection has been effectively controlled by active vaccination, screening of blood donors, the use of erythropoietin, and segregation of HBV carriers. To date, HBV remains an important cause of morbidity in endemic areas. Hepatitis delta virus is a defective virus that can only infect HBV-positive individuals. Hepatitis C virus is the most significant cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis and is mainly transmitted by blood transfusion. The introduction in 1990 of routine screening of blood donors for HCV contributed significantly to the control of HCV transmission. An effective HCV vaccine remains an unsolved challenge, however. Pegylation of interferon-α has made it possible to treat HCV-positive dialysis patients. Unexplained sporadic outbreaks of hepatitis by the mid-1990s prompted the discovery of hepatitis G virus and hepatitis GB virus C in 1995 and the TT virus in 1997. Although epidemiologic analyses revealed high prevalence rates of both viruses in the hemodialysis population, their exact role in liver disease has yet to be determined. The vigilant observation of guidelines on universal precaution and regular virologic testing are the cornerstones of the effective control of chronic hepatitis in the setting of hemodialysis. © 2005 International Society for Hemodialysis.

AB  - Tranfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), a single-stranded circular DNA virus that chronically infects humans and other animals, displays a high degree of genetic diversity and was originally thought to be associated with hepatitis. The prevalences of TTV infection among different populations of humans and non-human primates from Venezuela have now been evaluated, using serum samples and three different detection tests. All three tests were PCR-based, one involving a hemi-nested PCR and primers based on the N22 open-reading-frame-1 region (N22-PCR), another employing 55 cycles with primers from the more conserved untranslated region (UTR-PCR), and the other using a hemi-nested PCR with primers from the same region (HUTR-PCR). The overall prevalences of human infection appeared much higher with the HUTR-PCR (52%) than with the N22-PCR (13%) or the UTR-PCR (5%). When the products amplified by N22-PCR from 28 human isolates of TTV were sequenced, only two genotypes of the virus were detected. The non-human sera tested came from primates kept in a zoo in north-western Venezuela. TTV DNA was detected, by HUTR-PCR, in both of the chimpanzee sera tested but not in any of the sera from the 11 New-World primates or the other 12 Old-World primates that were investigated. The results, particularly those of the HUTR-PCR, indicate that TTV infection is common in Venezuela, especially in populations, such as many Amerindian groups, who live under poor sanitary conditions. Although TTV infection may be relatively rare among non-human primates from the New World, this will have to be investigated further, using many more samples collected throughout the Americas. © 2005 The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.

AB  - With the aim of helping define the epidemiological picture of the TT virus, we used the "heminested" PCR method to quantify the prevalence of TTV-DNA in the blood samples of 163 subjects, divided into four groups: healthy (80), microcytic anaemia sufferers (30), dialysis patients (27) and kidney-transplant (former dialysis) patients (26). In the amplification phase, primers were targeted on the N22 fragment of the ORF1 encoding region. In accordance with the findings of other Authors, our results indicate that TTV is widespread, both in the healthy population and in pathological groups, and that the percentage of prevalence is on average 43.41% higher in subjects with hepatitis B and/or C than in those without liver disease. Statistical comparison shows that none of the pathological conditions taken into consideration has a dominant role in the manifestation of TTV infection, also in relation to healthy subjects, The transaminase (ALT) values were found to be 30.89%, higher among subjects coinfected by hepatitis B and/or C and TTV, compared to corresponding hepatic patients without TTV. This finding supports the hypothesis that an active role is played by TTV in aggravating concomitant hepatitis B and/or C, but further studies should be performed to clarify the role of TTV in this controversial aspect of its epidemiology.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Men who have had sex with men (MSM) since 1977 are permanently deferred from donating blood. Excluding only men who engaged in male-to-male sex within either the prior 12 months or 5 years has been proposed. Little is known about infectious disease risks of MSM who donate blood. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Weighted analyses of data from an anonymous mail survey of blood donors were conducted to examine the characteristics of men reporting male-to-male sex during specified time periods. RESULTS: Of the 25,168 male respondents, 569 (2.4%) reported male-to-male sex, 280 (1.2%) since 1977. Compared to donors who did not report male-to-male sex, the prevalence of reactive screening test results was higher among donors who reported the practice within the past 5 years (≤12 months odds ratio [OR] 5.3, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.6-10.4; > 12 months to 5 years, OR 7.1, 95% CI 1.2-41.7); however, no significant difference was found for donors who last practiced male-to-male sex more than 5 years ago (>5 years-after 1977, OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7-2.6; 1977 or earlier, OR 1.6, 95% CI 0.7-3.7). The prevalence of unreported deferrable risks (UDRs) other than male-to-male sex was significantly higher for all donors who reported male-to-male sex with ORs ranging from 3.1 to 18.9 (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: No evidence was found to support changing current policy to permit donations from men who practiced male-to-male sex within the past 5 years. For donors with a more remote history of male-to-male sex, the findings were equivocal. A better understanding of the association between male-to-male sex and other UDRs appears needed.

AB  - Torque Teno virus (TTV) has been demonstrated to be present persistently in the blood of healthy individuals without evidence that it causes any disease process. The levels of TTV vary in patients co-infected with other viruses and there has been considerable speculation as to whether TTV contributes to pathogenesis by other viruses or if the varying levels might be related to immune activation in the host. In the present study, the load of TTV was examined in plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following immunization of subjects with either influenza (a recall antigen) or hepatitis B virus (HBV) (a new antigenic exposure). The results overall did not indicate a significant change in TTV titers over a 90 day observation period; however, when TTV genogroup was taken into consideration there was an increase in viral load in plasma at some time points for subjects persistently infected with genogroup 3. While this was observed in both influenza and HBV immunized subjects, the effect was more profound in HBV vaccination. Thus, it appears that exposure to a new antigen rather than a recall antigen may stimulate TTV replication more effectively. The data further suggest that investigating the interactions between TTV and its host might require to examine specifically each TTV genogroup separately in order to determine if certain TTV types have any role in disease pathogenesis. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The hepatitis G virus (HGV) and transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) are recently defined hepatitis viruses that the pathogenic roles in liver diseases are still not clear. It has been well known that some hepatitis virus, such as hepatitis C, might have an affinity to pancreatic islet cells. To investigate the relationship between the newly defined hepatitis viruses and diabetes mellitus (DM), we studied the prevalence of TTV and HGV in a type 2 diabetic patient population. Serum samples of 60 patients with DM and 45 healthy volunteers as control were taken. HGV RNA and TTV DNA was investigated by polymerase chain reaction. HGV was detected in none of diabetic patients (0%) and only one in control group (2.2%). However, TTV DNA was detected in 16 patients with DM (26%) and in five controls (11%). TTV was more prevalent in diabetic patients, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). These results revealed that TTV is more common in diabetic patients than in controls. At present, we don't know if this result is only a coincidence or a sign of potential association between TTV and DM. Further studies are certainly needed to elucidate a potential relationship. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a novel hepatitis virus which is considered to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. Wastewater samples were collected monthly from eight wastewater treatment plants in Japan for 1 year, from July 2003 to June 2004, and tested for the presence of TTV by TaqMan PCR. TTV was detected in 97% (93/96) of influent samples, implying that TTV is epidemic in Japan. TTV was also isolated in 18% (17/96) of secondary effluent samples before chlorination and in 24% (23/95) of final effluent samples after chlorination. There was no significant difference between the concentration of total coliform in TTV-positive final effluents and that in TTV-negative final effluents, which indicates that total coliform cannot be used as an indicator of TTV. No TTV was detected in 24 effluents for reuse from two wastewater treatment plants using sand filtration and ozonation. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Torque teno virus (TTV) is a circular, single-stranded DNA virus that chronically infects healthy individuals of all ages worldwide. TTV has an extreme genetic heterogeneity which is reflected in its current classification into five main phylogenetic groups (1-5). Using specific PCR assays, it has been shown that many individuals are co-infected with TTV isolates belonging to different phylogenetic groups. Here, a multiplex PCR assay was developed, using five recombinant plasmids. Each plasmid carried an insert of different size issued from a TTV isolate belonging to a different group. The assay was able to simultaneously amplify DNAs of TTV isolates belonging to all five phylogenetic groups. Multiplex PCR was then tested satisfactorily on DNAs extracted from 55 serum samples (47 health care workers and 8 AIDS patients). All individuals but nine were infected with at least one TTV isolate. Co-infection with multiple isolates was found in 29/47 (62%) health care workers and in 8/8 (100%) AIDS patients. A number of discrepancies were observed when results obtained with three thermostable DNA polymerases were compared. For example, four TTV phylogenetic groups were detected in a particular serum sample by using one of the three DNA polymerases, whereas the other two enzymes were able to detect only three TTV groups. However, none of the three enzymes used could be broadly considered to be more efficient than the others. Despite its limitations, the assay described here constitutes a suitable tool to visualize the degree of co-infection of a given population, avoiding time-consuming experiments.

AB  - The TT virus, a recently identified single-stranded DNA virus with unknown pathogenicity, has been shown to commonly infect humans. Viruses have been considered to contribute to disease pathogenesis in autoimmune disorders including idiopathic inflammatory myopathies (IIMs) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We assessed the prevalence of TTV infection in IIM compared with that in patients with RA and healthy blood donors. Detection of TTV was conducted by nested PCR and real-time PCR in the sera of 94 patients with IIM, 95 RA patients, and 95 age- and sex-matched healthy blood donors. Identity of the PCR products was confirmed by sequencing. TTV DNA was detected in 61 of 94 (64.9%) patients with IIM, in 64 of 95 (67.4%) patients with RA, and in 62 of 95 (65.3%; P &gt; 0.05) healthy individuals. Age, sex, activity, or duration of disease had no influence on TTV positivity in either group. However, patients with severe IIM (n = 36) had a significantly higher rate of TTV infection (31/36, 86.1%) than patients with mild disease (30/58, 51.7%, P &lt; 0.05, χ2 = 10.0). Disease was considered severe in IIM when immunosuppressive treatment was necessary because of continuous high activity and/or serious inner-organ involvement despite corticosteroid treatment. In conclusion, although we found the detection rate of TTV similar in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and rheumatoid arthritis and comparable to that in healthy controls, our data suggest that infection with TT virus may result in a more severe disease in patients with idiopathic inflammatory myopathies. © 2005 New York Academy of Sciences.

AB  - Presently, the diagnosis of virus infections is based mainly on serological assays. Although polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) have been increasingly used for the diagnosis of such viral infections, the risk of transfusion-transmitted blood-borne viruses remains. Furthermore, PCR and ELISA are expensive and time-consuming, and sometimes cause false-positive or false-negative results. Therefore, a rapid, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic procedure is needed. We subjected plasma from individuals infected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1), the causative agent of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), as well as plasma from uninfected individuals as a control to near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, which may provide a rapid diagnostic method for HIV-1 infection without using any reagent NIR spectra in the 600-1,000 nm region for plasma from pre-serologically HIV-1-infected individuals and healthy donors were subjected to partial least squares (PLS) regression analysis and leave-out cross-validation to develop a multivariate model to estimate the concentration of HIV-1. Simultaneously, the same plasma samples were examined for HIV-1 p24 by ELISA. The results obtained by the NIR spectroscopy model for HIV-1 yielded a good correlation with those obtained by the reference method (HIV-1 p24 ELISA). These results suggest that NIR spectroscopy using plasma could provide a rapid, accurate, cost-effective tool for large-scale diagnosis of HIV-1 infection.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a naked, single stranded DNA virus, which has been discovered in the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. TTV is widespread in the population, however, the mode of its transmission is unclear. This study was conducted to search for TTV-DNA positivity rates and its relationship with the clinical outcomes of recipients who underwent multiple blood or blood product transfusion, together with healthy children. TTV-DNA was investigated in 52 multitransfused pediatric patients (age range: 3 mnths - 17.5 yrs, mean age: 9.2±5.7 years) and 18 healthy children (age range: 1 mnth - 16.5 yrs, mean age: 8.1±4.9 years), by qualitative in-house semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with the primers NG059, NG061 and NG063, generated from ORF1 region of the viral genome. TTV-DNA was found positive in 30.8% of multitransfused, and 16.7% of healthy children. The differences of TTV-DNA positivity rates between the multitransfused and control groups, and ALT values between the patients with positive and negative TTV-DNA, were statistically insignificant (p>0.05). As a result, no relationship was detected between TTV positivity and hepatitis, although there was a statistically insignificant increase of TTV-DNA positivity in multitransfused children. However, since the primers of ORF1 N22 region used in our PCR method did not have enough sensitivity for the detection of TTV-DNA, it has been concluded that more sensitive primers such as UTR primers, should be used for more reliable evaluation of the results.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is the unique single stranded circular DNA virus, isolated from humans. Viral DNA is shown to be present not only in patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology but also in apparently healthy populations. TTV's role as a causative agent for non A-E hepatitis is widely questioned. In this study, 23 non A-E hepatitis patients (mean age: 46.8 yrs), 21 chronic hepatitis B (CHB) patients (mean age: 41.0 yrs), 28 chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients (mean age: 48.1 yrs) have been investigated, together with 90 healthy blood donors (mean age: 33.4 yrs), for the presence of TTV-DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Two sets of primers targeting different regions (N22 and NCR) of the viral genome were combined to enhance the detection sensitivity. TTV-DNA was detected in 10 (43.5%) of non A-E hepatitis, 10 (35.7%) of CHC, 4 (19.1%) of CHB patients, and 16 of studied 52 (30.8%) blood donors, by N22-PCR. Viral DNA positivity rates by using NCR-PCR were found as follows for the groups respectively; 65.2% (15/23), 50% (14/28), 42.9% (9/21) and 57.8% (52/90). The differences of TTV-DNA positivity rates between study groups were found statistically insignificant, when data from each set of primer were compared (p>0.05). However, the positivity rate of non A-E hepatitis group (91.3%) was significantly higher than CHC (64.2%), CHB (47.6%), and control (57.8%) groups, when the detection sensitivities of both sets were combined (p=0.002 and p=0.046, respectively). The study also revealed that the prevalence of TTV might be underestimated if appropriate molecular methods were not employed. DNA sequencing and genotyping are required to establish TTV's role as a causative agent of non A-E hepatitis and to identify certain genotypes that might have a role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis.

AB  - TTV is a non enveloped, single-stranded, circular- DNA virus that has been assigned to the Family Circiniviridae. The primary mode of TTV transmission was proposed to be transfusion (and hence its name). Little is known about the clinical significance and the natural history of TTV infection. Hence, responsibility of the virus for specific liver disease is still debated. In our study, we tested ninety five blood donors attending Kom EL-Decka regional blood bank in Alexandria for the presence of TTV DNA in their sera by PCR technique. The same samples were tested for ALT and AST levels by colorimetric technique and for HBsAg and anti-HCV by the ELISA technique. Out of the 95 blood donors, 46 (48.4%) had TTV DNA in their sera. None of the 95 blood donors included in this study was positive for HBsAg, while 22 (23.2%) were anti-HCV positive. Out of the 22 anti-HCV positive blood donors, 13 (59.1%) were TTV DNA positive, while out of the 73 anti-HCV negative blood donors, 33 (45.2%) had TTV DNA in their sera. There was no statistically significant difference between the prevalence of TTV DNA and anti-HCV in blood donors. No biochemical evidence of liver disease potentially linked to the TTV infection was observed in our blood donors who were TTV DNA positive. Furthermore, the occurrence of elevated serum AST and ALT was most often linked to HCV rather than TTV.

AB  - TTV was first isolated from the serum of a Japanese patient with post transfusion hepatitis of unknown ethiology in 1977. TTV has been visualized by electron microscopy and was found to be an unenveloped, small, spherical particle with a diameter of 30-32 nm, and is a member of family ralated to Circovridae family. The exact role of TTV in the pathogenesis of liver disease is yet to be established. Our aim was to determine the prevalence of TTV in thalassemic patients in Ahwaz. Viral DNA was studied in 250 thalasemic patients. The results were compared with those of 250 blood donor controls. DNA was extracted from plasma and amplified by semi nested polymerase chain reaction with reported primer sets from a conserved region of the TTV genome. 57.2% (143/250) samples obtained from patients and 20% (54/250) of blood donors were positive for TTV-DNA detected by PCR. The difference in TTV prevalence between the two groups was statistically (χ2) significant (P= 0.0001). The prevalence of TTV-DNA in Iranian thalassemic patients is high, which is the same as other countries.

AB  - Infantile hepatitis is occasionally seen in apparently healthy children. In most cases, the etiology of the infection is uncertain. However, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6), human herpesvirus-7 (HHV-7), human parvovirus B19, and TT virus (TTV) are considered to be associated with hepatitis in children. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlations between these viruses and infantile hepatitis. Twenty-six children from 1 to 24 months old (median age, 7 months) who had liver dysfunction of unknown etiology were enrolled in this study. Plasma samples were examined by a real-time PCR assay for CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-7, parvovirus B19, and TTV DNA. The DNA of CMV was detected in the plasma of four patients (15.4%) and was detected significantly more often in the patient group than in the control group. The CMV-infected patients were 1 to 3 months old, which was significantly younger than the remaining patients. The serological findings did not always correlate with the results of the real-time PCR assay. The DNA of TTV was detected in four patients (15.4%), while human parvovirus B19 DNA was detected in three (11.5%). However, the detection frequencies of these viral DNAs were not significantly different from those in the control groups, and some of these patients had co-infections. These results indicate that CMV might be one of the major pathogens responsible for infantile hepatitis; however, serological tests have limited utility for the diagnosis of CMV infection in young children.

AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the prevalence of HEV, TTV and GBV-C/GBV-C/HGV in patients with acute viral hepatitis A, B and non-A-C. We evaluated sera of 94 patients from a sentinel program who had acute hepatitis A (N = 40), B (N = 42) and non-A-C (N = 12); 71 blood donors served as controls. IgM and anti-HEV IgG antibodies were detected by enzyme immunoassay using commercial kits. TTV and GBV-C/HGV were detected by nested PCR; genotyping was done by sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. Anti-HEV IgG was present in 38, 10 and 17% of patients with hepatitis A, B and non-A-C. Four patients with hepatitis A and 1 with non-A-C hepatitis also had anti-HEV IgM detected in serum. TTV was detected in 21% of patients with acute hepatitis and in 31% of donors. GBV-C/HGV was detected in 9% of patients with hepatitis, and in 10% of donors. We found TTV isolates of genotypes 1, 2, 3, and 4 and GBV-C/HGV isolates of genotypes 1 and 2. Mean aminotransferase levels were lower in patients who were TTV or GBV-C/HGV positive. In conclusion, the detection of anti-HEV IgM in some acute hepatitis A cases suggests co-infection with HEV and hepatitis E could be the etiology of a few cases of sporadic non-A-C hepatitis in Salvador, Brazil. TTV genotype 1, 2, 3 and 4 isolates and GBV-C/HGV genotype 1 and 2 strains are frequent in the studied population. TTV and GBV-C/HGV infection does not appear to have a role in the etiology of acute hepatitis.

AB  - The hazards associated with pathogens in land-applied animal and human wastes have long been recognized. Management of these risks requires an understanding of sources, concentrations, and removal by processes that may be used to treat the wastes; survival in the environment; and exposure to sensitive populations. The major sources are animal feeding operations, municipal wastewater treatment plant effluents, biosolids, and on-site treatment systems. More than 150 known enteric pathogens may be present in the untreated wastes, and one new enteric pathogen has been discovered every year over the past decade. There has been increasing demand that risks associated with the land treatment and application be better defined. For risks to be quantified, more data are needed on the concentrations of pathogens in wastes, the effectiveness of treatment processes, standardization of detection methodology, and better quantification of exposure.

AB  - Background: Monitoring infectivity markers in multi-transfused patients is an important indicator of the efficiency and quality of testing in blood centers. This study is part of a regional initiative to bring both national and regional attention to the problem of hepatitis C, compare the threat of HCV to that of HBV and HIV; assess the risks for viral infection of using different blood products and implementing different transfusion practices, and contribute to a better understanding of the state of blood safety in the region. Study design and methods: A cross sectional study was conducted from September 2002 to August 2003 and included multi-transfused patients from eight private, public and Social Security hospitals from Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula, Honduras. A survey was completed for each patient which included demographic and clinical data. Patients were tested for HBsAg, anti-HBc, anti-HIV and anti-HCV Effects of the exposure to blood products, to whole blood; to lyophilized factor VIII in patients living with hemophilia on the prevalence of HBV, HCV and HIV infection were evaluated. Results: Five hundred and two patients were enrolled in the study; 11% were positive for HBsAg; 27% for anti-HBc; 7% for HCV and 1% for HIV One point six percent of hemophilia patients were positive for HBsAg; 38% were positive for anti-HBc and 26.9% for HCV A dose effect between the exposure to blood products and prevalence of HCV was found (p < 0.05). It was not possible to show a dose effect between the exposure to blood products and prevalence of either HBV or HIV in any of the subpopulations studied. Conclusions: The transfusion of blood products seems to be the main factor for HCV seropositivity in the subpopulation of patients studied. Additional work is needed to elucidate the risk factors associated with HBV infection in Honduras. © 2005 Elsevier B V All rights reserved.

AB  - The national surveillance of French blood donors is performed by the Institut de Veille Sanitaire and the National Reference Center for Hepatitis B and C in transfusion in collaboration with the Etablissement Français du Sang and the Army blood center. The main objectives of this surveillance are to evaluate trends in prevalence and incidence rates of blood-borne infections in the blood donor population, to identify routes of contamination and to assess residual risk. This exhaustive surveillance also contributes to evaluate the blood donor selection and the impact of measures taken to prevent infections in the general population. The analyse of the database of all blood donations obtained from 2001 to 2003 has shown that prevalence rates were stable in the study period (0.60 per 104 donors for HIV, 8.0 per 104 donors for HCV, 1.8 per 104 first-time donors for HBs Ag and 0.56 per 104 donors for HTLV), The incidence rate of HIV and HBV (1 per 105 person-years) was three-times higher than for HCV (0.35 per 105 person-years) and eleven times higher than for HTLV (0.09 per 105 person-years). At least, the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted viral infections is very low: 1/3 150 000 donations for HIV, 1/10 000 000 donations for HCV and 1/640 000 donations for HBV. The yield of Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) is limited since only 2 donations for HIV and 3 for HCV which were negative for antibodies were discarded thank to the NAT. © 2005 Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Anemia and allogenic RBC transfusions are exceedingly common among critically ill patients. Multiple pathologic mechanisms contribute to the genesis of anemia in these patients. Emerging risks associated with allogenic RBC transfusions including the transmission of newer infectious agents and immune modulation predisposing the patient to infections requires reevaluation of current transfusion strategies. Recent data have suggested that a restrictive transfusion practice is associated with reduced morbidity and mortality during critical illness, with the possible exception of acute coronary syndromes. In this article, we review the immune-modulatory role of allogenic RBC transfusions in critically ill patients.

AB  - Background. TT virus is prevalent worldwide, but its prevalence and genotype distribution in Central and East-Europe has not been determined. The high prevalence of TTV in multiply-transfused patients points to the importance of a parenteral mode of transmission, but since more than half of the general population is infected other possible routes of transmission must be considered. Methods. In our study, we investigated the epidemiology, transmission and phylogeny of TTV in the Czech Republic. The following groups were selected: a control group of 196 blood donors, 20 patients with hemophilia, 49 intravenous drug users, 100 sex workers, 50 penitentiary prisoners, 208 healthy children aged 1 to 14 years, 54 cord blood samples, 52 patients with non-A-E hepatitis, 74 patients with hepatitis C, and 51 blood donors with increased ALT levels. Primers specific for the non-coding region were used. The genotype distribution was studied in 70 TTV-positive samples. Results. The prevalence rate of TTV among the Czech population was 52.6%. We have shown that TTV is not transmitted prenatally. Children were infected after birth with two peaks: one at the age of two years and the other after the beginning of primary school. Adults have shown a further increase in the TTV prevalence with age. The highest TTV prevalence was found in the group of patients who had received multiple blood transfusions. The TTV prevalence rate in subjects at an increased risk of sexual transmission was not significantly higher than in the general population. Genotypes G2 and G1 were most prevalent among the Czech population, followed by G8 and G3. The subjects positive for markers of HBV and/or HCV infection tested significantly more often TTV DNA positive, which is suggestive of a common route of transmission of these three infections. Conclusions. This study on TTV prevalence, mode of transmission and age-specific prevalence is the most extensive study performed in Central and Eastern Europe. It showed insights into the epidemiology of TTV infection, but failed to associate TTV infection with clinical manifestations. © 2004 Salakova et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - The significance of co-infections with novel hepatitis viruses Hepatitis G (GBV-C, HGV) and TT virus (TTV) in chronic hepatitis C is not clear. We determined the prevalence of HGV RNA and TTV DNA in chronic hepatitis C patients and in asymptomatic hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers, and assessed the influence of these agents on the course of HCV infection. Seventy-seven patients with chronic hepatitis C - 50 of them treated with interferon (IFN) - and 33 HCV carriers with normal alanine aminotransferase have been investigated. Previous HBV infection was detected by testing serum HBsAg and aHBc. HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected by PCR. In the healthy population, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 0.3%, HGV RNA 8.0% and TTV DNA 18.5%. In chronic hepatitis C HGV RNA occurred in 9.09% and TTV DNA in 40.25% of cases. In IFN-treated patients with sustained remission, the frequency of TTV was 20% vs. 45.7% found in non-responders. Among asymptomatic HCV-carriers, the prevalence of HGV RNA was 9.09% and TTV DNA 75.7%. Neither HGV RNA nor TTV DNA had apparent effect on the HCV infection. TTV was detected with the lowest frequency in persons with sustained remission due to IFN, suggesting antiviral effect of IFN on TTV.

AB  - To investigate the prevalence of hepatitis E virus (HEV) infection among patients on maintenance hemodialysis, serum samples collected in January 2003 from 416 patients who had been undergoing hemodialysis for 7.6 ± 6.3 (mean ± standard deviation) (range, 0.3-26.0) years in a dialysis unit in Japan and serum samples that had been collected from these patients at the start of hemodialysis were tested for IgG antibodies to HEV (anti-HEV IgG) by an "in-house" enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Overall, 39 patients (9.4%) had anti-HEV IgG in January 2003, and included 35 patients (8.4%) who had already been positive for anti-HEV IgG at the start of hemodialysis and 4 patients (1%) who seroconverted after initiation of hemodialysis. Periodic serum samples that had been collected from the four seroconverted patients were tested for HEV antibodies and HEV RNA. The four patients became positive for anti-HEV IgG in 1979, 1980, 1988, or 2003, and continued to be seropositive until the end of the observation period. Although anti-HEV IgM was not detectable in the four patients, three were infected transiently with apparently Japanese indigenous HEV strains of genotype 3. The patient who contracted HEV infection in 1979 had been transfused with 2 U of blood 21 days before the transient viremia: one of the two stored pilot serum samples had detectable HEV RNA with 100% identity to that recovered from the patient. Our study provides evidence of transfusion-transmitted HEV infection in Japan in 1979, and that the prevalence of de novo HEV infection during hemodialysis was low (1.1% or 4/374). © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Human TT virus (TTV), originally isolated from a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis in 1997, is ubiquitous and non-pathogenic. Viruses related to human TTV have since been identified in non-human primates, bovine, ovine, porcine, feline, and canine. The objective of this study was to genetically characterize porcine TTV from pigs in different geographic regions. PCR primers based on the non-coding region of the only available porcine TTV isolate were designed to amplify porcine TTV DNA from sera of pigs in six different countries. Porcine TTV DNA was detected in 66.2% (102/154) of the swine sera. The percentages of positive pigs varied greatly from country to country and even within the same country: 33% in Iowa, USA; 40% in Thailand; 46% in Ontario, Canada; 80% in China; 85% in Korea; 90% in Spain; 100% in Quebec and Saskatchewan, Canada. A total of 40 porcine TTV isolates (five from each geographic region) were sequenced for a 218 bp fragment within the non-coding region. Sequence analyses revealed that porcine TTV isolates from different geographic regions shared 86-100% nucleotide sequence identity to each other. The prototype Japanese isolate of porcine TTV, Sd-TTV31, shared 90-97% nucleotide sequence identity with porcine TTV isolates reported in this study. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the clustering of the porcine TTV isolates is not associated with geographic origins. Although porcine TTV is not known to be associated with any swine disease, co-infection of pigs with TTV and other known swine pathogens may result in enhanced disease. There are also concerns for risk of potential human infection during xenotransplantation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a potential cause of post-transfusion hepatitis in patients with haemophilia. Plasma-derived clotting factor concentrates currently undergo processes that are effective in removal and inactivation of viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and C; however, their effectiveness with respect to TTV is unknown. To determine if TTV DNA is present in plasma-derived concentrates of factor IX, we tested 14 lots of Mononine® and compared the results with BeneFix®. Nucleic acid isolation, followed by a two-round polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and agarose gel analysis indicated that all 17 lots were negative for TTV. Although TTV may be considered an emerging pathogen, no evidence of the virus was detected in the commercially available plasma-derived concentrate of FIX most commonly used to treat haemophilia B. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV) was isolated recently from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV infection is widespread in the general population, and its prevalence increases continuously with age. The pathogenic role of TTV in liver disease remains controversial, and the source of transmission is still unclear. We investigated the pathogenicity and epidemiology of TTV infection in infants born to TTV DNA-positive mothers. Enrolled in this study were 22 mother-child pairs testing negative for antibodies to hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and the human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs). The children were followed for 30 months after birth. Serum TTV DNA was detected by N22-PCR, and the PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The prevalence of TTV infection in children increased with age. Of the 22 children, 13 (59%) became positive for TTV DNA during the follow-up period. Of these 13 children, 6 (46%) had elevated levels of serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), although the elevations were transient and mild. TTV viremia was not associated significantly with the abnormal ALT levels. Children with TTV viremia developed neither severe liver disease nor fulminant hepatitis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that, in 11 (85%) of the 13 pairs, the mother and child had the same genotype at the first PCR-positive time point. Among those 11 mother-child pairs, 6 (55%) had identical TTV nucleotide sequences. However, the genotype of predominant clones changed in 5 (50%) of 10 children who were positive for TTV DNA at two or more time points during the follow-up period. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence that TTV infection is related to liver disease in children. Although the main source of TTV infection in children is presumed to be their mothers, transmitted via non-parenteral routes in the course of daily contact, intrafamilial carriers may also be sources of TTV infection. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A 40-year-old female with chronic myelogeneous leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase was treated with imatinib mesylate (STI571) because of interferon resistance. She achieved complete cytogenetic response but not complete molecular response 3 months after STI571 administration. Six months later, she developed severe liver damage without evidence of actively infectious hepatitis A, B, C, G, E, TT virus, Epstein-Barr virus or cytomegalovirus. A significant serum level of STI571 (107 ng/ml) was detected, although she had not taken the drug for 6 days. Liver biopsy demonstrated massive hepatic necrosis, consistent with drug-induced hepatitis. She achieved complete molecular response, although she did not take STI571 for 47 days after the development of hepatitis. These results suggest that both hepatitis and molecular response were associated with the serum STI571 concentration. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - A nested PCR was used to detect TTV DNA in serum from 490 mother-infant pairs to determine the rate of vertical transmission of TTV in Guangzhou City, P.R. China. TTV DNA was positive in 87 mothers and 12 of their babies, giving a prevalence of 17.8% in pregnant women and a mother-to-child transmission rate of 13.8%. In eight mother-infant pairs, TTV DNA nucleotide sequences from the mothers and their corresponding infants were identical. The homology of Guangzhou TTV and Japanese TTV ranged from 85.3%-98.2% at nucleotide level. TTV infection is common in pregnant women in South China and vertical transmission can occur. Guangzhou's and Japanese TTV isolates belong to the same genotype.

AB  - The regulation of TT virus (TTV) gene expression was characterized. Transient-transfection assays using reporter constructs revealed that a 113-nucleotide (nt) sequence within the untranslated region, proximal to the transcription initiation site and containing a TATA box motif, has a basal promoter activity. This sequence is well conserved among different TTV genotypes. Upstream stimulating factor bound to a consensus binding motif within this region and positively regulates TTV transcription. Furthermore, a 488-nt region upstream of the basal promoter exhibited enhancer activity, presumably in a cell type-specific manner. This study illustrates some of the mechanisms involved in the transcriptional regulation of TTV.

AB  - Children with bronchopneumonia have considerably higher Torque tenovirus (TTV) loads than do children with milder acute respiratory diseases (ARDs). Moreover, in children with ARDs, high TTV loads correlate with low percentages of circulating CD3+ and CD4+ T cells and with elevated percentages of B cells, suggesting that TTV might be immunomodulatory. Here, we show that, in children with ARDs, the presence of TTV and TTV load correlate with concentrations of serum eosinophil cationic protein. The possible mechanisms whereby TTV infection might lead to augmented activity of eosinophils and the implications for pathogenesis are discussed.

AB  - Background: A novel single-strand, circular DNA virus has been recently isolated and named TT virus (TTV). It has been demonstrated that peripheral blood cells harbor TTV DNA, suggesting that the virus might replicate in lymphoid cells and contribute to lymphocyte imbalances with consequent immunosuppressive effects. The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence of TTV DNA in healthy and periodontally compromised subjects, evaluating the presence of the virus in the gingiva and saliva, and comparing virological results with clinical data. Methods: Twenty-one patients (seven males and 14 females, aged 25 to 76 years) were enrolled in the study. Eleven subjects were diagnosed with moderate periodontitis, while 10 were periodontally healthy. A sample of saliva was taken from each patient before recording the periodontal data; subsequently, a gingival biopsy was performed. A real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the presence of TTV DNA in saliva and gingival specimens. Results: A statistically significant association was, found between TTV in gingival tissue and the presence of periodontitis (P = 0.0351), while no association was observed between TTV in saliva and the presence of periodontitis (P = 0.4762). Conclusions: A new DNA virus (TTV) was first identified in the gingival tissue and was found to be significantly associated with the presence of periodontitis. These findings need to be investigated in further studies.

AB  - Of the eight different isolates of SEN virus (SENV), SENV-D and SENV-H have been suggested associated with transfusion-associated hepatitis. The prevalence and clinical significance of these two SENV strains among blood donors in southern Taiwan were investigated in this study. Sera of 223 blood donors who were negative for serum hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and third-generation HCV antibody (anti-HCV) from a blood center of southern Taiwan were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) anti-envelope protein 2 (anti-E2) antibody and RNA, and SENV-D and -H DNA. Of the 223 donors, the prevalence of SENV-D and/or -H (SENV-D/H), SENV-D, SENV-H DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA, and anti-E2 were 24.2, 19.7, 5.8, 2.2, and 8.5%. The donors with SENV-D DNA had a significantly higher mean age than those without (31.2 ± 10.9 vs. 27.5 ± 8.3 years; P=0.014). No association between positive SENV DNA and gender, GBV-C/HGV exposure, mean ALT level, or abnormal ALT was found. Based on multiple logistic regression analysis, the increased age was the only independent factor associated with positive SENV-D DNA (odds ratio, 1.042; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.08). Nearly a fourth of blood donors in southern Taiwan were infected by SENV-D/H, with SENV-D more prevalent than SENV-H. Patients with higher ages have a higher prevalence of SENV-D. SENV-D or SENV-H infection was not associated with ALT levels.

AB  - We report the isolation of 24 novel genotypes of TT viruses from a surgically removed spleen of a patient with Hodgkin's disease. The sequence analysis of our 24 isolates revealed the remarkable heterogeneity of TT virus isolates not only from the same patient but also from the same biopsy material. These isolates belong to four phylogenetic groups of TT viruses. Nucleotide sequence analyses revealed five distinct genotypes (tth3, tth4, tth5, tth6, and tth7). The limited variation in sequence identity of the other isolates defines the latter as variants of four of these genotypes. A group of 6 isolates (the tth7 group) revealed a reorganization of open reading frame 1 (ORF1) leading to one larger and a varying number of smaller ORFs. The nucleotide difference of the full-length genomes was less than 1%. A variation of 69 to 97% in amino acids of a second group of 8 isolates (the tth3 group) was restricted to the hypervariable region of ORF1, indicating the existence of a quasi-species. These isolates differed by less than 2% in the remainder of their nucleotide sequences. An alignment of these isolates with 79 previously reported TT virus genotypes permits the proposal of TT virus genera and species within the family Anelloviridae in analogy to a previous proposal for the papillomaviruses (family Papillomaviridae).

AB  - The prevalence and genotype distribution of human TT viruses (TTV) were analyzed in 312 Portuguese individuals. Detection of TTV DNA was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) through the combined use of N22 and UTR-specific primers and revealed a prevalence of infection of 74%. Detection of TTV DNA was not statistically associated to the use of intravenous drugs, infection with HBV, HCV, HIV-1, HIV-1 viral load or CD4 cell count (in HIV-1 infected individuals). Our data suggest that, in the population studied, the prevalence of TTV infection does not seem to be related to intravenous viral transmission. Phylogenetic analysis of 49 plasmid clones harboring N22-specific sequences revealed the circulation of genotypes: 1 (27%, subtype G1a and G1b), 2 (51%, subtype G2b and G2c) and 4 (22%), as well as multiple genotype infections (G1b-G2b and G1a-G4). To our knowledge, this is the first report of TTV detection and partial characterization of TTV genetic variants in Portuguese individuals. Our results show that TTV infection is widespread in Portugal as in other parts of the world. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Although the thrust of this chapter has been to discuss ongoing threats and continuing fears, let us not lose sight of how far the safety of the blood supply has come. Prospective studies have shown that the risk of post-transfusion hepatitis has declined from 30% in 1970 to virtual zero in 2000. Mathematical modelling shows the risk of hepatitis C, after the introduction of NAT testing, to have been reduced to approximately 1 case per 2 000 000 transfusions. The risk of hepatitis B is more difficult to calculate and may still be as high as I in 350 000 transfusions. HTV, transmission, the most devastating consequence of blood transfusion, has now been almost totally eradicated with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2 000 000 million transfusions. These low incidence rates for the previous major infectious scourges of blood transfusion are remarkable accomplishments of advancing technology and stringent regulation. There are still threats to face and perhaps others to come, but excellent strategies are in place to handle them and transfusion risk has been minimized to the extent possible within existing technologies. As the latter improve, the environment is such that they will be applied even if not cost effective by traditional definitions. New technologies might include sensitive point of release testing for bacteria, antibody testing for trypanosomes, a test to detect abnormal prions and gene arrays that will allow simultaneous testing for the genomes of multiple organisms, indeed virtually any organism that might pose significant danger to blood recipients. The ultimate strategy will be to develop inactivation methods that can pre-emptively strike against emerging threats and that can be applied to all blood products without introducing new risks or exorbitant costs. We are in a continuing and evolving battle with the mutational capabilities of infectious organisms. In this struggle, I believe technology will ultimately play the winning hand.

AB  - Background: TTV DNA has been reported in patients with a broad spectrum of hepatic disorders as well as in healthy people. Aim: To clarify the role of TTV in children with liver disease and in healthy children. Methods: Degenerate primers designed to amplify a target sequence from the ORF 1 region of TTV genome were used for nested PCR, to detect TTV DNA in sera. Results: TTV was detected in 3 of 18 children with chronic hepatitis B (16.7%), 2 of 17 hepatitis B carriers (11.8%), 2 of 17 children with cryptogenic chronic liver disease (11.8%), and 1 of 40 (2.5%) children without liver disease. The infection rate was similar among the various study groups and in the various age groups. There was no difference between TTV positive and negative children in respect to gender, history of surgery, parenteral treatment, transfusion of blood and blood products, presence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, jaundice, and transaminase values. Conclusion: TTV does not seem to have an etiologic role in cryptogenic liver disease in children and does not seem to influence the clinical course of liver disease.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered human virus of high genotypic diversity. TTV is widely distributed among humans, but the possible genotype-related differences in TTV biology are not well known. The prevalence and amount of TTV-DNA, especially of genotype 6, was determined by nested-PCR in various human tissues, and human parvovirus B19, another ssDNA virus, was used as a reference. TTV DNA was detected simultaneously in bile, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and plasma of 77% subjects, in 38% skin samples, in 38% synovial samples and in all (100%) adenoids, tonsils and liver samples. The relative concentrations of TTV-DNA did not vary significantly among the different samples. Genotype 6 TTV-DNA was detected in bile and plasma of one subject (3%), in skin and serum of one subject (8%) and in one liver (5%). The overall prevalence of TTV genotype 6 was 4% in subjects and 4% in sera. TTV genotype 6 was shown to occur in human tissues with no obvious tissue-type or symptom specificity. Parvovirus B19 DNA was detected overall in 38% subjects, and bile was the only sample type tested that did not persistently harbour B19 DNA. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widespread among the global population. Its pathogenic nature is still unclear but TTV seems to be more prevalent in cases of hepatitis than in healthy individuals. TTV harbours similarities to chicken anaemia virus (CAV). Here, the apoptotic potential of a putative TTV-derived 105 aa protein and of the main apoptosis-inducing agent of CAV, Apoptin, is compared. As the putative protein induced apoptosis in various human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cell lines, it was named TTV-derived apoptosis-inducing protein (TAIP). The apoptotic activity of TAIP in HCC lines was comparable with that of Apoptin. Conversely, unlike Apoptin, TAIP induced only low-level apoptosis in several non-HCC human cancer cell lines. The data suggest that TAIP acts in a different way to Apoptin as it is selective to a certain degree for HCC lines. This activity of TAIP, coupled with the heterogeneity of TTV isolates, may help to explain the variable reports of TTV pathogenicity. © 2004 SGM.

AB  - The SEN virus (SEN-V) belongs to a recently discovered group of DNA viruses whose members (SEN-V-D and SEN-V-H) are associated with post-transfusion hepatitis. It is a single-stranded circular, non-enveloped DNA virus of ∼3600 to ∼3800 nucleotides with at least three open reading frames (ORFs). Eight different strains of SEN-V have been identified and provisionally classified as members of the Circoviridae family, a group of small, single-stranded, non-enveloped circular DNA viruses that includes the TT virus (TTV), TUS01, SANBAN, PMV and YONBAN. Prevalences in different populations show great variability with marked differences between different countries and groups. Although parenteral transmission is very likely, other routes of transmission cannot be excluded. Mother to infant transmission has been demonstrated. The effect of SEN-V on chronic liver diseases has been studied. The influence of SEN-V on the response to HCV therapy was investigated in three studies, with contradictory results. Data for other acute and chronic liver diseases are sparse. Further studies are needed to define the pathogenesis and clinical importance of SEN-V infection. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Transfusion Transmitted Virus (TTV) is a hepatotropic virus and its transmission is by fecal-oral, intravenous and transplacental route. It is firstly isolated from 5 patients that were diagnosed as a post-transfusional non-A, non-G hepatitis in Japan. TTV is a single-strained, linear DNA virus which is similar to Circoviridae family. After replication in hematopoietic cells, the virus attacks liver. Although the risk of hepatocytic injury is lesser, the TTV is mostly seen in patients that have been exposed transfusions, transplantations and hemodialysis. Many cases of TTV infection are asymptomatic and the serum level of liver enzymes are normal. The recognization of TTV is good for explaining the cause of post-transfusional hepatitis, however there are still much more to be known about viruses that might cause hepatitis.

AB  - Background/Aims: The prevalence of co-infections with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and novel hepatitis viruses GBV-C (Hepatitis G virus, HGV) and TT virus (TTV) in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) infection has been studied. In patients with chronic hepatitis C and in asymptomatic healthy HCV carriers, the influence of these agents on the course of HCV infection was assessed. Methods: a total of 110 HCV-positive individuals, among them 77 patients with chronic hepatitis C - 50 of them treated with interferon (IFN) - and 33 HCV carriers with normal alanine aminotransferase have been investigated. HBV-DNA, HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected by PCR, to determine HBsAg and anti-HBc ELISA technic has been used. Results: In the healthy population, the prevalence of anti-HCV was 0.3%, HBsAg 0.09%, anti-HBc 2.5%, HGV RNA 8.0% and TTV DNA 18.5%, respectively. In chronic hepatitis C HBsAg (accompanied with HBV-DNA) occurred in 1.29%, anti-HBc 25.97%, HGV RNA in 9.09% and TTV DNA in 40.25% of cases. In IFN-treated patients with sustained remission, the frequency of TTV was 20% vs. 45.7% found in non-responders. Among asymptomatic HCV-carriers, the prevalence of anti-HBc was 27.27%, HGV RNA 9.09% and TTV DNA 75.7% respectively. Conclusions: Neither previous HBV infection, nor HGV RNA and TTV DNA had apparent effect on the course of chronic HCV infection. TTV was detected with the lowest frequency in persons with sustained remission due to IFN, suggesting antiviral effect of IFN on TTV.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the transfusion transmitted Virus (TTV) prevalence in three groups of population from Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The A group contained 39 multitransfused patients, the B group contained 10 blood donors supposed to be healthy persons which have never been transfused and the group C contained 43 patients with chronic liver pathology. In this last group, 33 patients had HBV positive serology and the 10 others, HCV positive serology. We used PCR to investigate TTV in patients serum. Detection rates were comprised between 67% and 82%. This is the first study to provide information about the high portage of TTV in ivorian population.

AB  - Molecular techniques have allowed the identification of new viruses in a number of patients with cryptogenic hepatitis. Whether they are clinically inapparent or true hepatitis agents remains unknown for some of them. Latest described viruses include GBV, TTV and SENV. However, based on the limited data available, they do not seem to be contenders for the new hepatitis virus title. However, researchers are looking for a role of these viruses in other chronic and acute human diseases. Only a careful evaluation of the data and the scientific concordance of all the evidence will resolve the question of whether they are only commensal viruses or pose a real pathogenic potential.

AB  - Since the discovery of TT virus (TTV) in 1997, its mechanism of transcriptional control has remained unsolved. Molecular analysis points at the 1.2-kb noncoding region (NCR) as being responsible for transcriptional control. The 5′ terminus of TTV mRNA was located at nt 114 using the primer extension method (nt 114 will be referred to as position +1). This employed the PE1 primer, designed to start approximately 100 nt downstream of the predicted initiation site. Overall promoter and enhancer activity of the NCR was analyzed using dual luciferase assays in K562, Jurkat, U937, A549, HepG2, Huh7, and HeLaS3 cells. Of those tested, K562 showed the highest relative luciferase activity of 31.1, and activity in HepG2 (14.6) was significantly higher than that in Huh7 (2.8). Fragments of <250 nt length, spanning the NCR, were inserted into a luciferase vector possessing an SV40 promoter. Fragments F5(-542/-311) and F6(-310/-197) showed promoter-enhancing activities of >6.0 by insertion not only in the sense orientation, but also both in the antisense orientation and downstream of the luciferase gene. The 5′ deletion of NCR from -1201 to -370 resulted in no significant decrease in the level of luciferase activity. A gradual decrease in the activity of the 5′-deletion mutants from position -370 through -155 was consistent with the loss of enhancer binding sites detected during fragment analysis. A further deletion at position -76 completely abolished luciferase expression, indicating that region -154/-76 contains the critical regulatory element for functioning of the TTV promoter. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Recent observations suggest that TT virus (TTV), in addition to liver, may also infect bone marrow. In this study, bone marrow samples and sera from 33 patients with haematological disorders and sera from 16 healthy controls were investigated for TTV DNA presence. Altogether TTV DNA sequences were demonstrated in bone marrow cells of 84.84% of patients. Moreover TTV DNA was detected in sera from 72.72% of patients and from 93.75% of controls. N22 sequences amplified from bone marrow cells and serum of 3 patients were analysed, after cloning: all these isolates were of type 2c and 2 or 3 variants were present in each isolate. After single strand DNA degradation, replicative forms were detectable in BM cells. This finding, in addition to the detection of variants similar in the BM and in the serum of the same patient could suggest that BM is a site of TTV replication (or one of the sites) from which the virus is spread in blood.

AB  - Background: TT viruses are single-stranded DNA viruses, suggested to be involved in non A-E hepatitis. We studied the prevalence of TTV infection in acute or chronic hepatitis in Belgium in comparison with that in blood donors and in patients regularly receiving blood products. Methods: TTV-DNA was detected by PCR using the primer set of Takahashi et al (1998) or a nested-PCR specific for genotype-2, because it had been reported that this subtype might be more pathogenic (Tagger et al. 1999). Results: TTV-DNA was present in 49% of 128 patients with chronic hepatitis C, in 54% of 54 with chronic hepatitis B and in 54% of 24 with acute liver failure. This prevalence is similar to the 47% in 127 patients with clotting disorders, or the 64% in 103 undergoing chronic haemodialysis, but lower than the 29.7% found in 340 healthy blood donors. Significant differences in clinical or biochemical characteristics between TTV-positive or TTV-negative patients could not be substantiated. The genotype-2 subgroup comprised 3.9%, but they also did not differ from non genotype-2 patients. Conclusions: The prevalence of TTV infection was higher in patients than in healthy blood donors. Its clinical significance remains questionable since clinical and biochemical characteristics were not different between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. The higher prevalence of TTV in patients might be related to parenteral transmission, but the relatively high prevalence in healthy blood donors points to an additional presumably faeco-oral infection. The presence of TTV in animals suggests that infection might also originate from food. Long term follow-up will have to define whether co-infection with TTV eventually alters the natural history of chronic hepatitis.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like viruses (TTVLs) have been reported to be associated with non-A-E hepatitis. To determine the rate of infection and genotypic characteristics of TTV in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), a total of 449 serum samples representing different populations in the UAE and comprising healthy as well as patients positive for HBsAg and HCV were screened. National subjects (n=200) and non-nationals residing in the UAE (n=249) were tested by PCR. The results obtained showed that the rate of TTV infection in healthy nationals, and those with HBsAg or antibody to HCV were 34.9, 97.9, and 95.7, respectively, compared to 89.1% (115/129), 89.2% (66/74), and 84.8% (39/46), respectively, in non-nationals. Sequence analysis of the untranslated region (UTR) using 71 clones generated from the PCR products of eight serum samples from healthy individuals (four nationals and four non-nationals) showed that 83.1% of the TTV clones were classified into groups 1-4, whereas 16.9% into possibly new genotype(s). The analysis also revealed that healthy national subjects carried multiple viruses. Phylogenetic analysis of representative sequences revealed clustering of clones into at least five major groups. Also, when compared to reference genotypes (from GenBank), two of our clones belonged to two previously identified genotypes. Non-significant gender differences were seen in all ethnic groups studied (P > 0.05). In conclusion, the rate of TTV infection in the UAE nationals is significantly lower (P < 0.05) than that of the non-nationals and several genotypes were isolated with common multi-infections. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) represent the first described human circoviruses. They do not show significant sequence homology with any other animal circovirus identified to date. They are both detected with high prevalences in various body fluids. The spread mode may include the parenteral way, the transmission by saliva droplets and the fecal-oral route. Genetic variability within a viral group is high and the co-infection by distinct viral strains is common in a given individual. The description of several messenger RNAs obtained after multiple splicing revealed a specific transcription profile. Despite apparent asymptomatic infections, the possible association of variants of TTV and TLMV with a given pathology cannot be formally ruled out. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: The aim of this study was to evaluate the transfusional transmitted virus (TTV) seroprevalence in asymptomatic HBsAg (+) patients and to assess the influence of TTV on the course of these patients. Methods: Sixty asymptomatic HBV carriers were included and 31 healthy volunteers served as controls. Cases were followed at 6-month intervals for a total duration of 4 years. Results: In the asymptomatic carrier group, 31 patients (51.7%) had a history of surgery and 10(16.7%) had a history of blood transfusions. TTV-DNA was detected in 45 of these patients (75%). In the control group, 12 patients (38.7%) had a history of surgery and 2 had (6.5%) a history of blood transfusions. TTV-DNA was found in 20 (64.5%) of these subjects. The incidence of TTV-DNA positivity was not significantly different between the two groups (P > 0.05). Conclusion: In spite of the common occurrence of HBV and TTV, TTV-DNA was also detected in 64.5% of healthy controls. Furthermore, during 4 years of follow up, TTV had no detrimental effects on the course of asymptomatic HBV carriers. These results suggest that the hepatic injury due to TTV is insignificant in this group of patients.

AB  - The main transmission route of TT virus (Transfusion-Transmitted Virus, TTV) and hepatitis G virus (HGV) is by parenteral route of blood and blood-products. Since they form the same risk group, some of TTV or HGV positive patients may also be infected by hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or hepatitis C virus (HCV). In this study, the presence of TTV and HGV has been investigated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR, GeneAmp 5700 Sequence Detection System, AB), in 40 hepatitis B, 30 hepatitis C and 5 hepatitis B and C co-infected patients, 50 HBV and HCV negative hemodialysis patients, and 50 randomly selected healthy blood donors. As a result, 37 (21.1%) TTV and 11 (6.3%) HGV positivity were detected, out of a total 175 cases. The positivity rates for TTV and HGV were found as 40% and 5% in HBV-positive, 23.3% and 20% in HCV-positive, 20% and 20% HBV+HCV co-infected patients, 20% and 4% in hemodialysis patients, and 6% and 0% in healthy blood donors, respectively. In conclusion, as the positivity rates were not low for these viruses, their role on the hepatitis pathogenesis should be further investigated by detailed studies.

AB  - Background and Aim: The role of the newly described transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), a circular single-stranded DNA virus, has been investigated in acute liver disease, comprising 36 patients with acute viral hepatitis (AVH) and 25 with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), including 50 volunteer blood donors as controls. Methods: Detection of TTV DNA sequences was carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers derived from the UTR(A) region of the TTV genome. The clinical course and biochemical profile when infected with TTV alone or coinfected with other classical hepatotropic viruses were analyzed. All patients were first evaluated for liver function profile and for the presence of various hepatotropic viruses using serological tests and PCR in serologically negative patients. Results: Transfusion-transmitted virus DNA was detected in 80.6% (29/36) of the AVH cases and in 76% (19/25) of the FHF cases, which were significantly higher levels (P < 0.05) than the 52% (26/50) observed in volunteer blood donors. No significant difference in symptoms, clinical course, liver function and risk factor profile between TTV-positive and TTV-negative patients could be observed in both AVH and FHF patients. TTV was found to coexist with both parenterally and non-parenterally transmitted hepatotropic viruses in similar frequency in both AVH and FHF patients. Further, there was no significant difference in the mortality rates between TTV-positive and TTV-negative FHF patients. Also, there was no difference between patients coinfected by TTV and other hepatotropic viruses and those with TTV infection alone. Conclusion: Thus, it appears that TTV, although it exists in a very high frequency in the Indian population, appears to have no significant etiological role in AVH and FHF. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Human isolates of the highly prevalent TT virus (TTV) have been classified into five major genomic groups (1-5). The geographical distribution of the groups throughout the world is not well known. Five different PCR assays were developed in an attempt to amplify specifically TTV DNAs of each genomic group. Serum samples collected from 72 Brazilian adults (24 voluntary blood donors, 24 hepatitis B virus (HBV) carriers, and 24 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-infected patients) were tested. TTV DNA from at least one genomic group was detected in 11 (46%) blood donors, 13 (54%) HBV carriers, and 24 (100%) HIV-1 patients. All five genomic groups were detected in the three populations, with the exception of group 2 in blood donors. Some samples, negative with all five specific assays, were positive with the commonly used untranslated region (UTR) PCR system. On the other hand, TTV DNAwas detected in some samples by using specific assays but not with the UTR PCR. Mixed infections with 2-5 TTV isolates from different groups were detected in 21% blood donors, 29% HBV carriers, and 71% HIV-1 patients. Fifteen PCR products (three obtained with each assay) were sequenced. Most sequences showed high (>86%) homology with those of TTV isolates belonging to their presumed groups. However, three sequences had low homology with all TTV sequences available from the DNA databanks. In conclusion, TTV isolates belonging to all five known genomic groups circulate in Brazil, and the results suggest the existence of new and as yet uncharacterised major genomic groups. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first isolated in 1997 from the patient with acute posttransfusion hepatitis. This fact led to the conclusion the virus was hepatotropic and could be considered as one of causative agents of acute hepatitis. However, later it was found in other human tissues and serological studies have revealed it is widespread. Multiple tropisms of TTV and the fact the virus is found in high rate of general population, are considered arguments for lack of medical significance of TTV in human pathology. Here we present a report of two cases of acute viral hepatitis in patients hospitalized at the Department of Infectious Diseases, Medical University of Lublin, in whom TTV-DNA was found in serum and serological and virological markers of common primary and secondary hepatotropic viruses were negative. The cases of acute hepatitis we present here should be treated as a preliminary report and the comment in the discussion about the real role of TTV in human pathology.

AB  - Aim: TT virus (TTV) is a newly described DNA virus related to postransfusion hepatitis that produces persistent viremia in the absence of clinical manifestations. PEG-IFN plus ribavirin have been useful in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. This study investigated the responses of TT virus (TTV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) to PEG-IFN plus ribavirin therapy. Methods: Fifteen patients infected with HCV were treated with PEG-IFN(0.5 μg/body weight/week) and ribavirin (1 000 mg-1 200 mg/daily) for 48 weeks. Blood samples were drawn at the beginning and the end of the therapy. Serum TTV DNA and HCV RNA were quantified by real time PCR. Results: At the beginning of treatment, TTV infection was detected in 10/15 (66.6%) of HCV-infected patients. Loss of serum TTV DNA at the end of therapy occurred in 6/10 (60%) patients. Out of these 6 patients, 4 (67%) became positive for TTV DNA after 6 months of therapy. Regarding HCV viremia, 11/15 (73%) patients were negative for serum HCV RNA after 48 weeks of therapy, 7/11 (64%) of these cases also became negative for TTV DNA following the combined treatment. In the 3/4 (75%) patients who were positive for HCV RNA at the end of therapy, TTV DNA was detected as well. Sustained HCV response at 6 months after treatment was 53% (8/15). Conclusion: No TTV sustained response can be achieved in any patient after PEG-IFN plus ribavirin administration.

AB  - Background: Little is known about the pathogenic role and the endemic situation of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV). Objectives: In this study, a molecular assay for detection of TTV based on automated nucleic acid extraction and real-time PCR was developed and evaluated. The new assay includes an internal control. Study design: After optimization of the molecular assay, 103 clinical samples were studied retrospectively. All sera had been tested for anti-HCV and anti-HIV-1 antibodies earlier. Results: The amplification efficiency was found to be 102%. When clinical specimens were tested, 79 of 103 serum samples were found to be positive for TTV. There was no significant difference between various groups of patients. The internal control was detected in all negative and weak positive samples. Conclusions: This molecular assay proved to be suitable for routine detection of TTV in clinical samples. Moreover, a relative statement on the TTV serum load can be done. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) DNA was detected in serum samples obtained from healthy infants and volunteer blood donors living in Jiujiang city in an attempt to shed light on the prevalence of TTV infection and the transmission route of TTV infection in infants. METHODS: Modified untranslated region, polymerase chain reaction (UTR PCR) and N22 PCR were performed to test TTV DNA in serum samples from 86 infants and 58 blood donors. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected by UTR PCR in 51 (53.5%) infants and 58 (100%) in blood donors, while that tested by N22 PCR was 14 (16.3%) and 22 (37.3%) in infants and blood donors, respectively. Among infants younger than 30 days, 1 - 6 months and 7 - 12 months of age, TTV DNA was detected by UTR PCR and N22 PCR at rates of 0, 33.3%, 95.0% and 0, 7.4%, 30.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: The prevalence rates of TTV DNA detected by UTR PCR were 95% in infants of 7 - 12 months after birth and 100% in healthy blood donors in Jiujiang city. However the results obtained by N22 PCR were much less frequently in the same population. Results showed that significant difference did exist in the prevalence of TTV DNA detected by the two different PCR systems. Age-dependent increase of TTV infection was observed in early childhood, while environmental sources were considered to be the most common route of TTV acquisition as the primary infection in infants. However, the prevalence of TTV in infants of 7 - 12 months was similar to that in healthy adults in the same region.

AB  - Objective: To assess the significance of increased serum transaminase levels in neonates admitted to a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and its relationship with blood transfusion. Methods: Follow-up prospective study of 209 patients; 177 completed follow-up, of whom 129 were transfused and 48 were not; 57 were born after full gestation and 120 were born prematurely. The activity of serum levels of ALT, AST, and GGT was measured monthly up to six months of age, and until six months after the last transfusion. At the end of follow-up, and whenever an increase in serum transaminase levels was detected, the viral agents of hepatitis A, B, C, G, TT, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr, and herpes 1 and 2, and toxoplasma were studied. Viral serology was also carried out in mothers and in donors when children tested positive. Results: One hundred twenty nine neonates (73%) received 461 U red blood cell transfusions (3.6 ± 3 U/patient). ALT levels increased in 54 (30.5%) patients, of whom 46 (36%) were transfused and eight (17%) were not (p < 0.05). The independent variables were 'infection by G virus' and 'parenteral nutrition for more than 12 days'; the variable 'transfusion' was close to the limit for statistical significance. Twenty patients (11.3%) had increased serum ALT levels 2.5 times above the normal value: 18 (14%) were transfused and two (4%) were not (p = 0.106). Only the G and TT viruses were related with transfusion; patients remained asymptomatic, although most neonates were chronically infected. Conclusion: Follow-up showed that increased serum ALT levels are common among severely ill neonates. Blood transfusions are safe concerning most hepatotropic viruses, but transmission of viruses G and TT is possible. Copyright © 2004 Arán Ediciones, S. L.

AB  - Objective: To assess physicians' knowledge and reporting practices of transfusion-transmitted infections (TTI). Design: Cross-sectional postal survey. Target population: Family physicians and specialists. Methods: A survey questionnaire was sent by mail to 1,359 randomly selected physicians across Canada, and was followed up by a reminder telephone call. Results: A total of 546 (40%) physicians completed and returned the questionnaire. The data from 512 eligible practitioners across Canada were analyzed. Almost all physicians were knowledgeable on the transmission of HIV, HBV and HCV through blood and plasma derivatives. However, physicians' knowledge, particularly the family physicians', was generally lower for less well-known TTIs. For example, only 7.2% of family physicians recognized Babesiosis as a TTI. Of the total 318 physicians who have encountered patients with possible TTI, 50% of them reported such cases to public health or other authorities and many reported to more than one organization. Of the total 159 non-reporting physicians, 91.1 % explained that the cases were already reported by laboratories or other physicians. More than 90% of respondents think that it is important or very important that physicians report the cases of TTI to public health authorities for the purpose of surveillance, and more than 80% of them think that it is important or very important to include TTI as a separate entity in the communicable diseases surveillance systems. Conclusion: The majority of physicians recognize the more common TTIs and only 50% of them reported such cases. The majority of physicians support the reporting of TTI to public health authorities for surveillance. Recommendations are made to increase physicians' knowledge and reporting of TTI.

AB  - We compared bone marrow findings in 2 groups of patients with AIDS during 2 different periods: group 1, n = 20; male/female ratio, 19/1; and group 2, n = 120; male/female ratio, 6/1. Bone marrow iron stores were decreased significantly in group 2 (P < .01), and the incidence of AIDS-related lymphomas was higher, with frequent bone marrow involvement. Two group 1 patients had Kaposi sarcoma, and a 21-month-old girl with transfusion-transmitted AIDS had Burkitt-like lymphoma. In group 2, 44 patients had a history of malignant neoplasms, including Kaposi sarcoma (10 cases), hematologic neoplasms (33 cases), and metastatic leiomyosarcoma (1 case). Of the 120 patients, 15 (12.5%) had bone marrow involvement by malignant neoplasms. The majority of the non-Hodgkin lymphomas were high-grade lymphomas. Patients with AIDS-related malignant neoplasms had higher CD4+ cell counts and viral loads than patients without malignant neoplasms (P < .01, P < .05, respectively). The finding of decreased iron stores in patients with AIDS might aid clinical management of their anemia. The increased incidence of malignant neoplasms, especially lymphomas, in recent years might be related to prolonged survival but with incomplete reconstitution of immune function after antiretroviral therapy.

AB  - TTV is a unique, unenveloped human virus with a genome of circular, single (minus)-stranded DNA of a total length of 3.6-3.9 kb, and it has a characteristic genomic organization and transcription profile that are not observed in known members of the Circoviridae family. It has been proposed by the ICTV Circoviridae Study Group that TTV is to be named as Torque Teno virus classifiable into a novel genus Anellovirus, unassigned to any family. At least 39 genotypes of TTV have been identified, and they are classified into five distantly-related groups (1-5). The natural history and pathogenic potential of TTV are currently under intensive investigation. Although the precise relationship between TTV infection and viral hepatitis remains to be established, it is likely that certain genotypes of TTV or some strains of TTV cause hepatitis in some clinical and epidemiological settings. As TTV replicates not only in the liver but also in other tissues such as the bone marrow and lung tissue, TTV infection may also be associated with extrahepatic disorders as suggested in several recent studies [91-97]. Therefore, detailed cross-sectional and longitudinal studies are required to address the exact role of TTV in children and adults with cryptogenic liver disease or other diseases that are currently of unknown etiology, with regard to the genotypes and viral load of TTV. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background. The major transmission route of Helicobacter pylori, oral-oral or fecal-oral, remains to be established. TT virus (TTV), a recently discovered microbe that is prevalent in healthy persons, is believed to be mainly transmitted by nonparenteral routes. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that these two microorganisms have a common mode of transmission. Methods. We investigated the seroprevalence of H. pylori and TTV in a cross-sectional study of 454 healthy Japanese children from birth to age 15 years, living in five different geographic areas. Determination of H. pylori status was based on the presence of specific serum IgG and IgA antibodies, determined using enzyme immunoassays. TTV DNA was detected and the titer was determined using semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction with heminested primers. Results. The overall prevalences of H. pylori and TTV were 12.2% and 21.6%, respectively. An age-related increase of prevalence was shown for H. pylori (P < 0.001), but not for TTV (P = 0.23). Titers of TTV DNA significantly decreased with age (P = 0.02). There were significant geographic differences in TTV prevalence (P < 0.001), but not in H. pylori seroprevalence (P = 0.33). There was no true correlation between the prevalence of these two organisms (φ coefficient = -0.02 and P = 0.66). Conclusions. Although Japanese children frequently acquire both H. pylori and TTV, especially in early childhood, their acquisition appears to be independent.

AB  - Background: Since 1990, the Canadian Red Cross Society and Canadian Blood Services have been testing blood donors for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody and HCV nucleic acids and have supplemented HIV antibody testing with p24 antigen testing. We report trends in the incidence of blood-transmissible viral markers and estimates of the risk of undetected infection in donors over the last decade. Methods: We extracted anonymous donor and blood-transmissible disease information from the Canadian Blood Services National Epidemiology Donor Database for 8.9 million donations from 2.1 million donors between June 1990 and December 2000. The risk of transfusion-transmitted infection (or "residual risk") refers to the chance that an infected donation escapes detection because of a laboratory test's window period (i.e., the time between infection and detection of the virus by that test). We determined the probability of residual contamination of a unit of blood after testing by using the incidence/window period model, which is based on the incidence of infection in repeat donors and the window period for each laboratory test. The viral markers evaluated in the study were HIV, HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human T-cell lymphotropic virus (HTLV). Results: Except for HBV, the transmissible-disease rates of the other evaluated viruses decreased over the study period, with less of a decrease for HTLV. In 2000, the transmissible-disease-positive rate per 100 000 donations was 0.38 for HIV, 16.83 for HCV, 12.40 for HBV and 1.77 for HTLV. The residual risk of HIV, HCV and HTLV decreased over the study period; the residual risk of HBV fluctuated throughout the decade. The current residual risk per million donations is 0.10 for HIV, 0.35 for HCV, 13.88 for HBV and 0.95 for HTLV. Interpretation: Except for HBV, the estimated risk of undetected infection (residual risk) has decreased over time. The rates of transmissible disease and the probability of undetected transmission of infection are at par with, if not lower than, those reported for other industrialized countries.

AB  - Among seven human hepatitis viruses (A to E, G and TT virus), hepatitis B (HBV) and C (HCV) viruses are able to persist in the host for years and principally contribute to the establishment of chronic hepatitis. During the course of persistent infection, continuous intrahepatic inflammation maintains a cycle of liver cell destruction and regeneration that often terminates in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While the expression and retention of viral proteins in hepatocytes may influence the severity and progression of liver disease, the mechanisms of liver injury in viral hepatistis are defined to be due not to the direct cytopathic effects of viruses, but to the host immune response to viral proteins expressed by infected hepatocytes. In the process of liver injury, hepatocellular death (apoptosis) induced by the proapoptotic molecules of T cells activated following antigen recognition triggers a cascade of antigen nonspecific effector systems and causes necroinflammatory disease. Accordingly, the regulation of the immune response, e.g., via the cell death pathways, in chronically infected patients should prevent the development of HCC.

AB  - Objective: To determine the possibility of TT virus (TTV) transmission in the uterus. Methods: Blood samples were collected from women who were pregnant for 3 to 6 months and from their aborted fetuses, and detected for TTV DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). The nPCR products were sequenced and analysed for nucleotide homology. Results: TTV DNA was positive in 5 of the 23 pregnant women (21.7%), and 2 of the 5 fetuses were TTV positive. Two pairs of mother-fetus TTV DNA nucleotide homology were 98.3% and 99.1%, respectively. Conclusion: TTV can be transmitted in the uterus.

AB  - Identification of hepatitis viruses A-E has enabled researchers to investigate the epidemiology, pathogenesis, sequelae, and possible means of prevention of these infections. This knowledge also provides a basis for further study of the pathological significance of candidate hepatitis viruses. With improvements in hygiene in many parts of the world, hepatitis A virus infection has decreased markedly. However, this success has the unintended consequence of rendering a large percentage of the younger population susceptible to hepatitis A virus infection. Fortunately, effective active immunization for hepatitis A virus is now available. Hepatitis B remains a common condition, especially in Asia and Africa which have high prevalences of chronic infection. Chronic hepatitis B carriers serve as reservoirs of infection for the community and are at risk of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma. A mass immunization program in Taiwan has been remarkably successful in reducing prevalence of chronic hepatitis B infection. Genotype of the hepatitis B viruses may be associated with the severity of liver disease and the responses to therapies. Hepatitis C is another important cause of death worldwide. The infection easily becomes refractory and the chronicity contributes to the development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Although no effective immunization is currently available for hepatitis C, it can be controlled by preventive measures and recently developed interferon-based treatments, especially in combination with ribavirin. The prevalence of hepatitis D has markedly decreased in the last decade and new cases are now rarely encountered. Hepatitis E is endemic in limited areas and travel to these areas appears to be the main risk factor for contracting the infection. Several new candidate hepatitis viruses have been identified, including GB virus-C, TT virus, and SEN virus, but none of these has been shown to cause hepatitis, and they may be passenger viruses.

AB  - China is an area of high endemicity for viral hepatitis, and the molecular epidemiological investigation of TT virus (TTV) infection is of interest. In the present study, we investigated the epidemiology, clinical significance and molecular characteristics of TTV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in Yanbian City, China. Serum samples obtained from 74 patients with hepatitis B and hepatitis C who visited Yanbian Hospital, located in northeast China, were analyzed in this study. The study group included 22 cases of chronic hepatitis B (B-CH), 17 cases of liver cirrhosis B (B-LC), 7 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma (B-HCC), 16 cases of chronic hepatitis C (C-CH), 11 cases of liver cirrhosis C (C-LC) and 1 case of hepatocellular carcinoma (C-HCC). Detection of TTV DNA was performed as described by Nishizawa et al. The second-round PCR products from 7 subjects were sequenced, followed by investigation of nucleotide homology and phylogenetic analysis. TTV DNA was present in 18.2, 5.9, 28.6, 6.3, 9.1 and 0% of the patients with B-CH, B-LC, B-HCC, C-CH, C-LC and C-HCC, respectively. The highest prevalence of TTV infection was seen in the groups aged 40-50 and over 60 years. There was no significant correlation between the presence of TTV DNA and the clinical parameters in patients with hepatitis B and C. The various isolates showed 97.9-100% with isolates reported previously from Japan and 98.4-100% with isolates reported previously from China. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed that the Yanbian isolates could be classified in the same group as the Japan and China isolates. We concluded that chronic coinfection with TTV did not affect the serological features of chronic hepatitis B and C in China, as found in Tokyo, Japan. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Background: GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) and TT virus (TTV) have been widely reported in patients with high parenteral risk such as haemodialysis and renal transplant recipients. The occurrence of these agents in association with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV), in Indian renal transplant recipients, is yet unreported. Study design: Molecular and serological markers of GBV-C/HGV and TTV were examined in addition to those for HBV, HCV and hepatitis D virus (HDV) in a selected group of seventy renal transplant recipients. HGV RNA detection was achieved using primers specific for the 5′NCR and NS5a regions of the genome. Anti-GBV-C/HGV antibody was detected using the μ plate anti-HG env kit (Roche, Germany). TTV DNA PCR was performed using primers specific for the coding region (method A) of the genome. In 50% of patients, TTV DNA was also tested for using primers specific for the non-coding region (method B). Host related factors such as age, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, number of transfusions, haemodialysis sessions, and months following transplantation were also studied. Results: Exposure rates to GBV-C/HGV, TTV (method A), HBV, HCV and HDV were 58.6, 32.9, 52.9, 54.3 and 2.9%, respectively. 'Active' infection as measured by viraemia and/or virus-specific antigenaemia for GBV-C/HGV, TTV, HBV and HCV was 52.9, 32.9, 15. 7 and 52.9%, respectively. The majority of GBV-C/HGV and TTV infections were seen as co-infections with other hepatitis viruses. Single infection with GBV-C/HGV and TTV was seen in ten (14.2%) and eight (11.4%) patients, and was not associated with ALT elevation when compared to uninfected blood donors. Using univariate analysis, GBV-C/HGV RNA was significantly associated with ≥20 haemodialysis sessions. TTV DNA occurrence was not associated with any risk factors. Conclusions: There is a high occurrence of GBV-C/HGV and TTV in this select group of renal transplant recipients in India. These viruses mostly occured in the context of co-infections with other hepatitis viruses. Long term effects of multiple hepatotropic viral infections need to be carefully documented in such transplant populations. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

Thirty-one of these patients were TTV positive, and 27 patients had virus in both tissues. In addition, 13 of the patients who had TTV in gastric tissue were Helicobacter pylori positive. There was an association of higher TTV titers in gastric tissues of patients who were H. pylori positive than in those in whom the bacterium could not be detected. Furthermore, this association was stronger in H. pylori-positive patients with the presence of the caga protein. Of 10 specimens in which genogroup determination was carried out in the gastric corpus 5/5 that were H. pylori positive showed the presence of TTV genogroup 3, while for those that were H. pylori negative, 5/5 showed the presence of genogroup lt. By contrast, genogroup 1 was found in the corpus of only one H. pylori-positive patient, and genogroup 3 in only one H. pylori-negative patient. The histological severity of gastritis did correlate significantly with loads in the gastric tissues. There was no significant difference in TTV titer in blood of patients regardless of H. pylori infection status. These findings pique interest in clarifying the role of TTV, alone or in association with H. pylori infection, in the pathogenesis of gastritis. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Objective. To confirm the close relationship of high co-infection rate between HIV and hepatitis virus in intravenous drug users (IVDUs). Methods. Anti-HIV, HBV and HCV were detected by ELISA in the serum from 35 scattered and 15 massed IVDUs. PCR and RT-PCR were performed to confirm the infection of HIV, HBV, HCV, HGV and TTV among the 15 massed intravenous drug abusers. Results. Among the 50 IVDUs, the positive rates of anti-HCV, HBsAg, anti-HBe and anti-HBc were 92% (46/50), 12% (6/50), 10% (5/50) and 66% (33/50), respectively. In the samples of HBsAg positive, their HBeAg was also positive. Although the positive rate of serum markers was different in the massed IVDUs compared to the scattered IVDUs, no significant difference was shown. In the cases of massed IVDUs, the positive rates of HIV DNA, HBV-DNA, HCV-RNA, HGV-RNA, and TTV-DNA were 100% (15/15), 26.6% (4/15), 53.3% (8/15), 33.3% (5/15) and 26.6% (4/15), respectively. Among the 15 massed intravenous drug users, one was infected with HIV, HBV, HCV, HGV and TTV; two were infected with HIV, HBV, HCV and HGV; three were infected only with HIV; and the remaining had other forms of co-infection. Conclusion. The co-infection rate of HIV, HBV, HCV, HGV and TTV in intravenous drug users is very high.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) produces chronic plasma viremia in around 90% of healthy individuals of all ages and has, therefore, been proposed as a commensal human virus. We recently demonstrated that in children hospitalized for acute respiratory diseases high TTV loads were associated with severe forms of disease. Here, we report that in such children TTV loads showed an inverse correlation with the percentage of circulating total T and helper T cells and a direct correlation with the percentage of B cells. Thus, florid TTV replication might contribute to lymphocyte imbalances and, possibly, immunosuppressive effects, thus resembling related animal viruses.

AB  - Objectives: To determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) in a population of Danish hemodialysis patients and evaluate possible relations between TTV infection and elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and hypo-response to treatment with erythropoietin (EPO). Material and Methods: Patients on maintenance hemodialysis at a single center were invited to participate. Demographic and clinical data were registered. Blood samples for virological and routine biochemical tests were drawn simultaneously. TTV DNA was detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV viral load was estimated by means of semi-quantitative PCR. All patients were tested for hepatitis B, hepatitis C and GB virus C. Results: Of 252 patients, 204 (80.9%) gave their written informed consent to participate in the study. The prevalence of TTV was 68% and 50% of TTV-positive patients had a high TTV viral load. TTV-positive patients were significantly older than TTV-negative patients (p = 0.011). No relations were found between TTV infection and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or CRP or hypo-response to EPO treatment. The mean hemoglobin concentration was 11.24 ± 1.48 g/dl. Patients with a high TTV viral load had a lower level of hemoglobin (10.86 ± 1.47 g/dl) than the others (p = 0.01). This trend suggested a positive relation between TTV infection and the number of blood transfusions. A restriction fragment length polymorphism assay suggested that patients were infected with different TTV strains. Conclusions: TTV is common in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. The presence of TTV is associated with increasing age. Patients with a high TTV viral load had lower levels of hemoglobin than the others. TTV infection is not related to elevated levels of ALT or CRP or to hypo-response to EPO treatment.

AB  - Nonalcoholic fatty liver associated with obesity, diabetes mellitus or hyperlipidemia-the most frequent liver disease-occasionally progresses via nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) to cirrhosis. Recently, the designation nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has been widely used to describe a novel clinical entity encompassing nonalcoholic fatty liver, NASH and cirrhosis. In the present study, the concepts of fatty liver and NASH are first discussed. Next, the etiology of NASH is described, and the diagnosis and treatment of fatty liver and NASH are outlined. Several findings concerning the clinical and pathological differences between alcoholic hepatitis and NASH are discussed, as is the putative link between TT virus and NAFLD.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of TTV in patients with acute hepatitis A and B, and to genotype TTV isolates by phylogenetic analysis. The authors evaluated sera of 82 patients who had acute hepatitis A (N = 40) and B (N = 42), and of 71 blood donors. TTV was detected by nested-PCR assay and phylogenetic analysis was performed using the neighbor-joining method. TTV was detected in 23% of patients with acute hepatitis and in 31% of donors. Mean aminotransferase levels were similar in patients who were TTV positive and TTV negative. A phylogenetic tree was drawn that showed TTV isolates of genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4. In conclusion, TTV infection is more frequent among blood donors than among patients with acute hepatitis A or B in Salvador-Bahia. TTV does not appear to increase the severity of necroinflammatory activity of acute hepatitis A or B. Using phylogenetic analysis TTV isolates of genotype 1, 2, 3, and 4 were encountered in the study population.

AB  - Objective: To determine the prevalence and clinical impact of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) DNA in patients with chronic liver diseases in the Southeast Anatolia region of Turkey where hepatitis B and C viral infections are endemic. Subjects and Methods: Patients diagnosed with chronic liver disease by clinical, biochemical and histologic means were enrolled in the study. Serum samples of 60 patients (19 males, 41 females) with chronic liver diseases, and of 45 healthy volunteer blood donors as a control group were collected. The chronic liver disease group consisted of 11 patients with hepatitis B, 44 with hepatitis C and 5 with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. Presence of TTV DNA was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction. Using a scoring system histological grading of inflammation and staging of fibrosis were performed only in the chronic hepatitis C group. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 47 (78%) patients with chronic liver disease and 5 (11%) volunteers in the control group. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). Ten of the 11 (91%) patients with hepatitis B, 32 of 44 (73%) of those with hepatitis C-related chronic liver disease, and 5 of 5 (100%) of the patients with cryptogenic liver disease were positive for TTV DNA. Conclusion: TTV is highly prevalent in patients with chronic liver diseases in Southeast Anatolia, Turkey but no pathogenic effect attributable to TTV infection was detected. Copyright © 2003 S.

AB  - Introduction: Transfusion with homologous blood is not without costs for the recipient: An increased risk of postoperative infections must be anticipated, and the risk of transfusion-transmitted viral infections is of growing concern. This has increased the interest for methods which can reduce the need for intraoperative blood transfusion. The goal of this study was to determine if acute normovolemic hemodilution combined with fibrinolytic inhibition and the use of cell saver can reduce the need for homologous blood transfusion in total hip arthroplasty compared to the cellsaver technique alone. Material and metbods: 145 patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty in spinal anesthesia were included in the study. They were all operated by the same surgeon. In group A (N = 64) only the cell saver was used, wheras in group B (N = 81) it was combined with acute normovolemic hemodilution and use of the fibrinolytic inhibitor tranexamic acid. Results: The total blood loss and the need for homologous blood transfusion were significantly smaller in group B than in group A. Discussion: Although the cell saving technique is effective in total hip arthroplasty, this study demonstrates that a further reduction of blood loss and homologous blood transfusion can be achieved by combining the method with acute normovolemic hemodilution and pharmacological inhibition of fibrinolysis.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the responses of TT virus (TTV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) to a long-term lamivudine therapy. Methods: Sixteen patients infected with both TTV and HBV were treated with lamivudine 100 mg daily for 30 months. Blood samples were drawn at the beginning of the therapy and subsequently at month 3, 6, 9, 12 and 30. Serum TTV was quantified by real time PCR and serum HBV was detected by hybridization assay and nested polymerase chain reaction. Results: TTV infection was detected in 100 % of HBV-infected patients. Loss of serum TTV DNA after one year of treatment occurred in 1/16 (6 %) patients. At the end of therapy, TTV DNA was positive in 94 % of them. The decline of HBV viremia was evident at 3 months after therapy and the response rate was 31 %, 44 %, 63 %, 50 % and 50 % at month 3, 6, 9, 12 and 30, respectively. Conclusion: TTV replication is not sensitive to lamivudine and is highly prevalent in HBV-infected patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding the donor base, infectious disease prevalence, and donation loss at various blood donation sites will help maximize blood collection efforts and blood availability. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Using donation data collected at five US blood centers, the prevalence of HIV, HTLV, HBsAg, and HCV in first-time whole-blood donations at 10 donation sites was evaluated: military, education, religious, professional, industry, services, community, health care, government, and fixed sites. Donation loss from screening test reactivity at each donation site was also evaluated. RESULTS: During the study, 1.2 million first-time whole-blood donations were collected. Military and education sites had a low prevalence of all viral markers, except for HBsAg, which was highest at education sites. Variations in viral marker prevalence among donation sites were partially explained by donor demographic differences. Donation loss varied by donation site, ranging from 3.3 percent at education sites to 6.4 percent at industry sites, indicating differential efficiency of blood collection efforts. CONCLUSION: Different rates of positive viral test results and donation loss in first-time whole-blood donors were observed at various types of donation sites. This information may be useful in estimating the yield of usable units from specific blood drives and in allocating resources to meet blood center collection goals.

AB  - The present study was designed to investigate how two chronically replicating viruses, TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV), interact with host defence systems. Successive serum samples from three groups of subjects, undergoing modifications of their antiviral defence, were tested by real-time PCR to measure changes in viral titers, and by sequence analyses to indicate whether increases in viremia could be attributed to infection with an unfamiliar strain: 1) in patients receiving immunosuppressants subsequent to kidney transplantation, viral titers tended to increase; 2) in soldiers undergoing extreme training known to cause immunosuppression, insignificant increases in titers were observed; and 3) interferon treatment of patients with hepatitis C virus caused a temporary decrease in TTV and TLMV titers. Increases in viremia were associated only occasionally with the appearance of novel strains. The above results add to knowledge on how these viruses are influenced by the host. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) may occasionally be transmitted through transfusion of blood units that are hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) negative but HBV DNA positive. Children with β-thalassemia are particularly susceptible to HBV because they receive multiple blood transfusions. These children have high infection rates despite vaccination against HBV. Post-vaccination infections may be a result of viruses harbouring surface (S)-gene mutations (e.g. G587A) in a region critical for reactivity to antibody to hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBs). The true prevalence of HBV in individuals with β-thalassemia has not been studied previously. Patients and Methods: Seventy patients with β-thalassemia (median age 6 years; range 8 months to 22 years; 49 male), who had received seven to 623 (median 61) units of blood each and three doses (10/20 μg) of HBV vaccine (Engerix B) before presentation to us, were included in the study; 50 of the 70 patients had received transfusions prior to vaccination. Enzyme-linked immunoassay for serological markers [HBsAg, antibody to hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc) and quantitative anti-HBs] and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by Southern hybridization for molecular detection of hepatitis B, was performed on all samples. The PCR-amplified product was cloned, sequenced and the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences for the HBV S and polymerase (P) genes were analysed for mutations. Results: Four of 70 (5.7%) individuals with β-thalassemia were HBsAg positive and 14 (20%) were anti-HBc positive. The prevalence of serological markers increased with number of transfusions (P < 0.01). Of 70 patients, 53 (75.7%) had an anti-HBs titre of > 10 IU/1 following vaccination and 17 (24.3%) were non-responders (< 10 IU/1); 22 (31.4%) of the 70 were DNA positive. The frequency of HBV infection in β-thalassemia was similar in vaccine responders and non-responders. The virus was of subtype ayw (genotype D) in the five DNA-positive samples in which a 388-nucleotide region of the S gene was sequenced. Mutations occurred at 13 positions in the S gene and at 10 positions in the P gene. Hydrophobicity plots revealed differences in amino acid regions 117-165 and 195-211. Some of these amino acid substitutions coincided with the putative cytotoxic T-lymphocyte epitopes of both S and P proteins. Conclusions: A high frequency of HBV infection was seen using molecular methods in thalassemic patients. The frequency of infection was similar in vaccine responders and non-responders. A number of mutations were observed in the S gene, which could have implications for viral replication as well as virus-host cell interaction.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The frequency of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infectious donations entering the blood supply in England is too low to monitor using observational studies. The expected frequency of infectious donations can be estimated and these estimates may be used to contribute to monitoring of blood safety and used in the design of strategies to decrease the risk of transfusion-transmitted infections. Materials and Methods: The prevalence and incidence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), and antibodies to HCV and HIV (anti-HCV and anti-HIV, respectively) in donors in England, between 1993 and 2001, were used together with data about the length of negative 'window-periods' of current assays for each of these markers and data about test performance, to estimate the number of infectious donations that enter the blood supply. The risks were calculated separately for donations from new donors and from repeat donors, and for the three time periods 1993-95, 1996-98 and 1999-01. Results: The estimated frequency of infectious donations entering the blood supply in England, between 1993 and 2001 was 1 in 260 000 for HBV and 1 in 8 million for HIV. For HCV, the frequency of infectious donations was 1 in 520 000 during 1993-98 and fell to 1 in 30 million during 1999-2001 when all donations were tested for HCV RNA. The frequency of HBV- and HCV-infectious donations entering the blood supply fell over these 9 years: the frequency of HIV-infectious donations remained essentially unchanged. The risk from donations from new donors was found to be approximately sevenfold higher than the risk from donations from repeat donors. Conclusions: The risks of HBV-, HCV- or HIV-infectious donations entering the blood supply in England are very low, and have decreased since 1993. Although the accuracy of these estimates is imperfect, mainly owing to uncertainty in some assumptions and to small numbers of infections, they provide some quantification of the risk of HBV, HCV or HIV transmission by transfusion, and allow comparison of the magnitude of these risks for each infection and over time. The methods we have used have been developed and improved from previously published methods.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) genogroup 1 infection has an increased prevalence in solid organ transplant recipients. In this study, the presence of TTV in renal transplant recipients was examined by two PCR methods, one capable of detecting most TTV genotypes (UTR-PCR), the other specific to genogroup 1 (N22-PCR). The N22-PCR detected TTV in 57% (53/92) of the renal transplant patients and in 20% (13/66) of the healthy individuals, while the prevalence of TTV with the UTR-PCR was above 90% in both the control and the patient groups. The N22-PCR was used in longitudinal studies of 31 renal transplant recipients, these PCR products were sequenced and aligned. TTV status was not associated with the patients' age at transplantation, male to female ratio and the time lag between kidney transplantation and the TTV test. During the follow-up consistent TTV status was found in 26 patients, while two initially TTV positive patients converted to negative and three initially negative patients converted to positive. The TTV variants varied among the tested patients, but were the same in the consecutive samples of each patient, indicating that TTV infection was persistent in renal transplant recipients and novel infection occured rarely in the post-transplant period.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The Blood Services of the UK permanently de-select men who have had sex with men (MSM) from donating blood. The rationale for this has been questioned. This article attempts to evaluate whether this selection criterion does contribute to blood safety. Materials and Methods: Data about transfusion-transmissible infections, in particular about human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, were used to evaluate whether de-selection of MSM meets the aims of donor selection. Models were constructed to estimate the risk of HIV-infectious donations entering the blood supply should this criterion be changed. Results: Many assumptions were required to generate estimates of the risk of HIV infection entering the blood supply. The accuracy of the estimates is therefore uncertain and the probable ranges around the estimates were wide. However, by using the most probable assumptions, our models suggested that de-selection of MSM for 12 months since the last sexual contact, or complete removal of this selection criterion, would be expected to increase the risk of HIV-infectious donations entering the blood supply in England by approximately 60% (from the current risk of 0.45 per year to 0.75 per year) and 500% (to 2.5 per year), respectively. The increase in numbers of non-infected donations would be relatively small - less than 2% of donations. The probability of a relatively high frequency of other sexually transmissible blood-borne infections also currently favours maintaining permanent de-selection of MSM, irrespective of the risk of HIV-infectious donations. Current compliance with this selection criteria was estimated to be 95%. Conclusions: Based on current knowledge, accepting blood donations from MSM would probably increase the risk of transfusion-transmission of HIV and of other blood-borne infections. Good compliance with this criterion has contributed greatly to the safety of blood transfusions in England. Better communication about donor selection, to maintain and improve compliance with this and other selection criteria, is recommended. Other risk groups are gaining in relative importance for the risk of transfusion-transmitted HIV infection, and ongoing evaluation of all donor-selection criteria is also recommended.

AB  - Objective: Sequencing, analysis of genomic structure of two distinct TT virus (TTV) variants. Methods: DNA was extracted from 2 viremic infants in Jiujiang city who were infected with divergent TTV variants unclassifiable into the known four genetic groups. Full-length genome of TTV was then amplified by long inverted PCR and then cloned, sequenced and analyzed. Based on the entire nucleotide sequences of two isolates determined in this study, PCR primers were designed and synthesized for detecting the prevalence of the novel TTV variants among the population. Results: A new TTV genetic group, group 5, was identified in the present study; the entire nucleotide sequences of 2 novel TTV variants named CT39F, CT44F were determined. In addition, the prevalence of TTV infection among infants less than 30 days, 1-6 months and 7-12 months of age was 0, 27.3%, 39.5% respectively and in volunteer blood donors living of the same region was 45.8%. Conclusion: Results obtained in the present study indicated an extremely genetic diversity among the novel group, genetic group 5 and other four reported groups. However, basic genomic organization and its function were highly conserved. In addition, group 5 TTV was negative among the infants less than 30 days of age and detected at a high frequency of 27.3% and 39.5% at the age of 1-6 months and 7-12 months respectively. This suggested an age-dependent increase of TTV infection in early childhood in this city and the environmental factors are potentially concern with.

AB  - Objective: Since virus infections in AIDS patients are mostly inevitable and as they frequently cause disease deterioration and therapeutic failures, a comprehensive investigation was made of the influence of the coinfections of 9 well-known viruses on disease progression in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV). Methods: A cross-sectional study of 62 HIV-positive patients was conducted to correlate the prevalence rates for the 9 viruses with the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and CD4 cell counts of the patients. Results: The rates of HIV-positive patients infected with the 9 viruses are significantly higher than those of the control groups. Furthermore, almost one third of the patients in the studied group was coinfected with transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) and manifested significantly higher ALT levels (p = 0.020), and these were raised further if coinfection with TTV and human hepatitis C virus had occurred (p = 0.010). By analyzing CD4 cell counts, the only significant effect on AIDS progression which could be detected was coinfection with human herpesvirus 8. Conclusion: This result confirmed that immune-suppressed persons are more vulnerable to common virus infections. Unlike hepatitis B or C virus, TTV seems to accelerate the progression of chronic hepatitis in HIV-infected patients. Copyright © 2003 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Aim: To determine the prevalences of TW and HGV infections among blood donors and patients with chronic liver disease in Korea, to investigate the association of TTV and HGV infections with blood transfusion, and to assess the correlation between TW and HGV viremia and hepatic damage. Methods: A total of 391 serum samples were examined in this study. Samples were obtained from healthy blood donors (n=110), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)-positive donors (n=112), anti-hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV)-positive donors (n=69), patients with type B chronic liver disease (n=81), and patients with type C chronic liver disease (n=19). TTV DNA was detected using the hemi-nested PCR. HGV RNA was tested using RT-PCR. A history of blood transfusion and serum levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were also determined. Results: TW DNA was detected in 8.2 % of healthy blood donors, 16.1 % of HBsAg-positive donors, 20.3 % of anti-HCV-positive donors, 21.0 % of patients with type B chronic liver disease, and 21.1 % of patients with type C chronic liver disease. HGV RNA was detected in 1.8 % of healthy blood donors, 1.8 % of HBsAg-positive donors, 17.4 % of anti-HCV-positive donors, 13.6 % of patients with type B chronic liver disease, and 10.5 % of patients with type C chronic liver disease. The prevalence of TTV and HGV infections in HBV- or HCV-positive donors and patients was significantly higher than in healthy blood donors (P<O.05), except for the detection rate of HGV in HBsAg-positive donors which was the same as for healthy donors. There was a history of transfusion in 66.7 % of TTV DNA-positive patients and 76.9 % of HGV RNA-positive patients (P<0.05). No significant increase in serum ALT and AST was detected in the TW- or HGV-positive donors and patients. Conclusion: TTV and HGV infections are more frequently found in donors and patients infected with HBV or HCV than in healthy blood donors. However, there is no significant association between TTV or HGV infections and liver injury.

AB  - Approximately 10% of transfusion associated hepatitis and 20% of community acquired hepatitis cases do not have a defined etiology, suggesting the existence of an additional causative agent. The recent agents which have been detected in blood were Hepatitis G virus (HGV) and TT virus (TTV), members of the family Circoviridae. These viruses were initially thought to be associated with post-transfusion hepatitis but later studies negated this causal effect. Recently, a novel DNA virus at the moment designated as SEN virus (SEN-V) was discovered and is thought to be associated with post-transfusion hepatitis. This virus is related to the above two agents and belongs to the same family. Whether, like HGV and TTV causal relationship with hepatitis is finally confirmed only time will tell, but, at the moment the association appears to present. The present review summarizes the present available data on this new agent of hepatitis.

AB  - The majority of the viral hepatitis cases is caused by five hepatitis viruses (A,B,C,D,E). In 1997, TT virus was discovered. It was supposed that a number of the unknown hepatitis cases was caused by the TT virus. The aim of this study was to characterize TT viruses carried by healthy individuals and patients suffering from hepatitis of unknown origin in Hungary. TTV DNA was detected by seminested PCR with the commonly used N22 primers. Twenty of the 108 sera (18.5%) taken from healthy persons and 115 of the 228 sera (50.4%) of patients with hepatitis of unknown origin were found to be positive. The nucleotide sequences of 26 clones derived from 17 hepatitis patients and 15 clones from nine healthy persons were determined and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. Genotype 2 (group 1) was found to be the most frequent, but other group 1 genotypes (1, 6) and genotypes 8 and 17 of group 2 were also detected. Mixed TTV infections were found in eight cases (two healthy persons and six hepatitis patients). Variants belonging to the same group were carried in seven cases, and the presence of group 1 (genotype 2) and group 2 (genotype 8) TTV sequences were found in one single hepatitis patient. © 2003 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

AB  - Isolates of the newly characterized, single-stranded DNA virus TTV, have been tentatively classified into four major phylogenetic groups and at least 28 genotypes. Four Japanese isolates, designated as YONBAN viruses, belong to the fourth group and to genotype 21. In this study, a genotype 21-specific PCR assay was standardized. With this assay, 48/184 (26%) serum samples and 76/167 (46%) saliva samples, collected from unselected ambulatory patients (aged 2 to 82) of a Brazilian public hospital, were positive. A total of 110 (66%) patients had TTV genotype 21 DNA in serum, saliva, or both fluids. Furthermore, 18/37 (49%) serum samples, collected from Indians belonging to three ethnic groups of the Western Brazilian Amazon, were also positive. Nucleotide sequences (253 bases at the 3′ end of the non-coding region of the genome) were determined, that derived from 25 individuals, i.e. 17 patients and eight Indians. Phylogenetic analysis showed that three isolates from Indians of a particular ethnic group formed a separate subgroup within genotype 21. Among non-Indians, a clustering of strains was observed according to their country of origin (Japan or Brazil), with all 17 sequences derived from Brazilian patients located in a unique subgroup.

AB  - The tissue tropism and possible correlation with liver disease of the TT virus (TTV) as well as its prevalence and genotype distribution remain undefined. TTV-DNA was investigated in paired sera and tissue samples from 144 patients, and sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSF) from additional six subjects. Of the 144 tissue samples, 128 were liver biopsy specimens from subjects with hepatic disease while 16 were surgically obtained nonliver specimens from patients with extrahepatic disease. TTV cloning, sequencing and genotype analyses were performed on isolates from sera, tissue specimens and peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients with hepatic and four patients with extrahepatic pathologies, as well as from sera and CSFs of two subjects. TTV was found in 100% of the examined tissues and in 60.1 and 50% of sera from patients with hepatic and extrahepatic pathologies. respectively. Moreover, TTV was detected in four of the six CSFs analysed but only in two correspondent sera. Genotyping revealed the coexistence of multiple TTV genotypes and genetic variants in each infected individual, and the analysis of TTV mRNA showed the presence of transcripts in all the six different tissues studied. These results indicate that the entire adult population in our area is more likely infected by TTV, although several subjects are not viraemic and that TTV infects many different human tissues and is able to invade the central nervous system.

AB  - Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of gene variant of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV). Methods: A nested polymerase chain reaction (nested-PCR) assay with specific primers from open reading frame one (ORF1) of TTV genome was established to detect TTV DNA in the serum samples from patients with hepatitis B and blood donors. Asymmetric PCR was established to get single strand DNA in the TTV DNA positive cases, and then single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) was applied. Results: 1.25 ± 0.50, 1.60 ± 0.55, 3.36 ± 1.36 and 4.59 ± 1.83 SSCP bands were detected in the blood donors, chronic HBV carriers, chronic hepatitis B patients and chronic severe hepatitis B patients respectively. SSCP bands were much more complicated in chronic hepatitis patients and chronic severe hepatitis than those of chronic HBV carriers and blood donors (P < 0.05). Conclusion: There is gene variant in TTV infection. The complication of gene variant strain or quasispecies infection of TTV may be one of the causes responsible for clinical exacerbation of TTV superinfecion in chronic hepatitis patients.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like minivirus (TLMV) are small DNA viruses with single-stranded, closed circular, antisense genomes infecting man. Despite their extreme sequence heterogeneity (>50%), a highly conserved region in the untranslated region (UTR) allows both viruses to be amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV/TLMV infection was detected in 88 of 100 human plasma samples; amplified sequences were differentiated into TTV and TLMV by analysis of melting profiles, showing that both viruses were similarly prevalent. PCR with UTR primers also detected frequent infection with TTV/TLMV-related viruses in a wide range of apes (chimpanzees, gorillas, orangutans, gibbons) and African monkey species (mangabeys, drills, mandrills). These findings support the hypothesis for the co-evolution of TTV-like viruses with their hosts over the period of primate speciation, potentially analogous to the evolution of primate herpesviruses. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - Objective: To identify the influence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) co-infection in other virus infected patients and its genotypes. Methods: A conservative sequence of ORF1 in the TTV genome was selected as primers and TTV DNA was measured in students and other hepatitis patients by using microplate nucleic acid hybridization and ELISA. The results were statistically analyzed. Nucleotide sequence of divergence >50% was used as color probe for distinguishing TTV genotypes I or II. Results: TTV DNA was detected in the sera from 2 (3.3%) of 60 students, 2 (14.3%) of 14 patients with non A-non E hepatitis, 6 (12%) of 50 patients with chronic hepatitis B, and 4 (16%) of 25 patients with liver cirrhosis, respectively. Statistical difference was observed between the patient group and the student group (P<0.05), but no significant difference in age, gender, serum ALT levels and TBiL between TTV DNA positive and negative patients (P>0.05). TTV genotype type I was by far the most frequent viral genotype (66.7%), followed by type II (25%), and mixed infection (8.3%). Conclusions: These results suggest that the routes of TTV infection may be similar to those of HBV and HCV, and concurrent infection with HBV, HCV are common. TTV co-infection could not affect the clinical features of patients with liver diseases and the pathological process. TTV is not a main causative factor for patients with non A-non E hepatitis. Further study is needed to clarify the role of TTV in patients with non A-non E hepatitis.

AB  - Recently, we identified TTV isolates from nonhuman primates and named them simian TTV (s-TTV). To investigate the prevalence of s-TTV in humans, we examined sera from healthy individuals and patients with liver diseases in Japan for the presence of s-TTV DNA by PCR assay. s-TTV DNA was determined by nested PCR using s-TTV-specific primers designed from untranslated region of s-TTV genome. s-TTV DNA sequence was detected in three of 200 (1.5%) healthy adults but none of 48 infants without liver disease. On the other hand, s-TTV DNA was detected in 30 of 287 (10.5%) Japanese patients with liver disease. s-TTV coinfection with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus were present in 16.7 and 30% of these patients, respectively, while 53.3% of patients were positive for s-TTV alone. Nucleotide sequence analyses in 20 patients confirmed that these PCR products were derived from s-TTV genome sequences and nearly 85% identical to those of s-TTV prototypes from chimpanzees. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all s-TTV isolates from humans were distinguished clearly from the human TTV isolates. Furthermore, s-TTV in humans was classified into two different genotypes as well as simians. Our results indicate that generally 10.5% of Japanese patients with liver diseases were infected with s-TTV. The routes of s-TTV transmission from animal to human require clarification. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The natural history and pathogenic potential of the recently identified TT virus (TTV) are currently a matter of intensive investigation. In an attempt to shed some light on these issues, nasal and blood specimens of 1-to 24-month-old children hospitalized with a clinical diagnosis of acute respiratory disease (ARD) were examined for the presence, load, and genetic characteristics of TTV. The results have indicated that at least in young children, the respiratory tract not only represents a route by which abundant TTV can be shed into the environment but also may be a site of primary infection and continual replication. Although we found no compelling evidence that TTV was the direct cause of ARD in some of the children studied, the average loads of TTV were considerably higher in patients with bronchopneumonia (BP) than in those with milder ARD, raising interesting questions about the pathophysiological significance of TTV at this site. Furthermore, group 4 TTV was detected almost exclusively in children with BP.

AB  - The paper reviews the available information on the newly discovered viruses originally supposed to cause post-transfusion hepatitis. GBV-C/Hepatitis G virus belongs to the Flaviviridae family, and can be transmitted parenterally like Hepatitis C virus. Its role in causing hepatitis or other diseases has not been proved yet. The other newly discovered viruses contain single-stranded circular DNA, with a wide range of sequence divergence. These viruses can be transmitted not only with blood and blood products but via fecal-oral route as well. They are unique among enterally transmitted viruses in the sense that the virus persists for years in the human body, therefore their genomes may be detected in the blood of the healthy population in high percentage. One of the genotypes of TTV is suspected to cause hepatitis. High TT virus load was found as an independent factor associated with the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma among patients with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. It is not clear yet, whether TTV-like minivirus and SEN virus cause any illnesses.

AB  - Background/Aims: TT virus is a novel DNA virus that is associated with posttransfusion hepatitis. The prevalence, risk factors, and clinical significance of TT virus infection were evaluated in patients with chronic renal failure who are on hemodialysis. Methodology: Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to test for TT virus DNA in the serum of patients on hemodialysis as well as in healthy controls. Results: TT virus DNA was detected in 15 (20.0%) of the 75 patients on hemodialysis and 10 (13.2%) of the 76 healthy controls (P>0.05). In chronic renal failure patients on hemodialysis, the prevalence of TT virus did not differ according to the duration of hemodialysis or the amount of blood transfusion. The prevalence of TT virus was higher in IgG anti-hepatitis B core antibody-positive patients than IgG anti-hepatitis B core antibody-negative patients (27.5% vs. 4.2%, P=0.03). Two (13.3%) of the 15 TT virus-positive and 6 (10.0%) of the 60 TT virus-negative patients showed elevated alanine aminotransferase levels (P>0.05). Conclusions: TT virus infection did not occur more frequently in patients on hemodialysis than in healthy controls. No relationship was found between TT virus infection and liver disease. The correlation between TT virus infection and IgG anti-hepatitis B core antibody suggests that TT virus may share some routes of transmission with hepatitis B virus.

AB  - In an effort to determine the cause of non-A-E hepatitis, a retrospective study was undertaken on a group of patients with hepatitis but without serological infection markers of hepatitis viruses A-E. A total of 60 patients admitted to Beijing Ditan Hospital during the period of September 1997 and September 1999 were chosen for this study. These patients were diagnosed as either acute or chronic hepatitis, but no serological markers of hepatitis viruses A-E were detected. Since TT virus (TTV), human parvovirus B19 (B19), SEN virus (SENV), and GB virus C/HGV were reported to be associated with hepatitis, attempts were made to detect the presence of these viruses in the sera of patients with non-A-E hepatitis by a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) method. Also, more sensitive nPCR and RT-nPCR methods were used to determine HBV DNA and HCV RNA in these patients. Results derived from these analyses demonstrate that HBV DNA was detected in most of these patients (47/60, 78.3%), suggesting that HBV infection played a major role in occult non-A-E hepatitis and detection of HBV DNA by more sensitive PCR methods such as nPCR should be considered for diagnosis of HBV infection. In addition, HCV RNA was detected in three (5%) of these patients. However, GBV-C (HGV) RNA was not detected, and TTV, B19, and SENV appear not to be associated with non-A-E hepatitis, as the prevalence rates of these viruses in patients with non-A-E hepatitis were similar to those in patients with viral hepatitis A-E. The results from this study indicate that co-infection of TTV or B19 with HBV did not increase the severity of the disease. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - A 43-mm hepatic tumor was incidentally detected by computed tomography in a 72-year-old man. Liver function test results were normal. Serum hepatitis B, C and G viruses were negative, while serum TT virus was positive. Autoantibodies were negative. The patient had no history of alcohol consumption. The tumor was found to be a moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from a resected specimen. Neither lobular inflammation nor fibrosis was observed in the surrounding liver. Intrahepatic hepatitis B virus was not detected. This is a case of non-B, non-C HCC positive for only TT virus arising from a non-cirrhotic liver.

AB  - Nationwide nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) for hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) of blood donated voluntarily after serological screening was implemented on July 1st 1999 for transfusion and plasma fractionation by the Japanese Red Cross blood transfusion services. From February 1st 2000, HBV, HCV and HIV-1 NAT screening of pools of 50 negative serologically screened donated blood was started and the results were reported within 1 day after blood donation. Systems were established for rapid shipment, electronic communication, automated specimen preparation, pooling and automated amplification and detection. At present, NAT screening is carried out within 1 day after donation. This report describes the blood screening system by NAT and the results obtained from over 16 million blood samples using simultaneous screening for HBV, HCV and HIV-1 with multiplex reagent. Between February 1, 2000 and December 31, 2002, 16 012 175 serologically negative units were tested by NAT. 308 units with Hepatitis B virus DNA (HBV DNA) were detected. The sensitivity of 50 pool NAT screening with input volume of 0.2 ml is significantly higher than that of highly sensitive HBsAg testing. 46 cases with HCV RNA and six cases with HIV-1 RNA were detected. These cases were not detected by HCV antibody and HIV-1 antibody screening. The false positive rate was 0.18%. The NAT system was developed from serological screening test negative non-remunerated voluntary donations. We supply blood products to medical organizations after screening by NAT for HBV, HCV and HIV-1 for transfusion and source plasma for fractionation. This is the first automated integrated system for prevention of transfusion transmitted HBV, HCV and HIV-1 infections, by NAT screening. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Background: The clinical significance of TT virus (TTV) coinfection in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients and influence of TTV viremia on hepatitis C virus (HCV) response to high dose interferon-alpha therapy in Taiwan were investigated. Materials and Methods: Total 102 HCV RNA-positive CHC patients were enrolled. TTV DNA (using polymerase chain reaction primers derived from 5′ non-coding region and open reading frame 2), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) RNA, anti-E2 antibody, genotype and RNA levels of HCV were tested. Results: The prevalence of TTV DNA was 51.0%. The mean age of TTV viremic CHC patients was significant higher than non-viremic ones (P < 0.05). HCV sustained viral response (SVR) was achieved in 42 (41.2%) patients. Based on multivariate regression analyses, SVR were significantly associated with low pretreatment HCV RNA levels, HCV genotype non-1b and high pretreatment levels of ALT but not TTV viremia. Conclusions: TTV viremia is highly prevalent among Taiwanese CHC patients and related to increased ages. Neither severity of liver disease nor replication and genotype distribution of HCV was affected by concurrent TTV infection. With high HCV SVR rate associated with pretreatment HCV RNA and ALT levels and HCV genotype, TTV viremia did not influence the HCV response. © 2003 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV and HCV) have been associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Recently, a novel DNA virus was isolated from a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology and designated TT virus (TTV). To examine whether this virus is associated with HCC, we investigated sera from 82 Egyptian patients with histopathologically-diagnosed HCC. All subjects underwent serological investigations for detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), hepatitis B core antibody (HbcAb) and anti-HCV. Detection of TTV-DNA was performed by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TTV-specific primers. TTV-DNA was detected in 28% of the patients. Age, gender, risk factors and biochemical liver functions did not significantly differ between TTV-DNA positive and negative patients. TTV was detected in 27.1% of patients with HCV-HCC, 25% of HBV-HCC, 66.7% of dual HCV and HBV infection and 40% of those with non-B, non-C-HCC (NBNC-HCC). It is concluded that, in this the cohort of Egyptian patients with HCC, TTV infection is common and is not associated with HCV, HBV, NBNC-HCC, history of schistosomiasis or blood transfusion.

AB  - A group of 24 well-characterized patients doubly infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TT virus (TTV) were studied to evaluate whether the loads and number or identity of the genogroups of TTV they carried could affect the response of HCV infection to interferon-alpha (IFN) treatment. The features of HCV infection in the study patients provided a fair representation of the variables that are usually found in considering patients for IFN treatment. The same was true for the features of TTV infection. In particular, plasma loads of TTV varied over a wide range in individual patients, and infection with multiple TTV genogroups was extremely frequent. TTV genogroups 1 and 3 were the most prevalent, followed by genogroups 4 and 5. The HCV response to IFN was evaluated by measuring plasma viraemia at 24 hours and 30 days after initiation of treatment. The results showed that the TTV parameters investigated had little or no impact on the response of HCV to therapy. Due to study design, these results do not exclude that the presence of a concomitant TTV infection can affect how HCV infection responds to treatment. However, they indicate that, should such effects exist, they would be independent on load and genetic features of the infecting TTV.

AB  - Human TT virus (TTV) recently isolated from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis does seem to have only hepatopathic effect. The virus can also infect the serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and bone marrow cells (BMC). Additional evidence has indicated that TTV is also present in the serum of people with hematopoietic malignancies. A significant increase in the incidence of lymphoma has recently been observed worldwide. We have investigated the presence of TTV DNA in lymph node biopsies of Italian patients affected with the most common lymphoma types in Western Countries: follicular lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and nodular sclerosis Hodgkin's disease (NS-HD). The possible role of a co-infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has also been investigated. DNA was extracted from 73 paraffin-embedded and 38 snap-frozen tissue specimens. From these, only 67 samples (29 paraffin-embedded and 38 snap-frozen tissues) from a total of 56 patients, were suitable for PCR analysis. TTV and EBV were detected by PCR using primers from two different conserved region in TTV and EBV genomes respectively. TTV DNA was detected in 30.0 -50.0% of FL, 30.8% of DLBCL and 30.0-50.0% of NS-HD cases, depending on the primers used. All cases of non-specific reactive lymphoid hyperplasia (RLH), used as a putative control, were negative. The two major TTV genotypes circulating in Italy (G1 and G2) were detected in the analysed lymphoid neoplasms. EBV DNA was detected in 40.0% of FL, in 72.7% of DLBCL, in 80.0% of SN-HD and in 40.0% of RLH cases. EBV co-infection was found in 90% of TTV positive cases. The in situ hybridization assay was performed in TTV positive frozen samples. The significant prevalence of TTV DNA in lymphocytes circulating in the lymph nodes of both B-cell lymphomas and HD reported herewith suggests a possible implication of TTV infection in the development of these lymphoproliferative disorders.

AB  - Transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) is a new DNA virus found in patients with post-transfusion hepatitis. The prevalence of this virus among dental patients has not been reported, therefore, the prevalence of TTV infection in consecutive dental inpatients was evaluated. TTV DNA was assayed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 441 dental inpatients with oral cancer (n = 192) or oral cysts (n=249). The serum HBs antigen and HCV antibody as well as aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (γ-GTP) concentrations were also measured. Of 441 subjects, 137 were infected with TTV (31.1%). This prevalence of TTV was much higher than that of HBV or HCV (HBV 1.2%; HCV 6.0%) in these dental patients. There was no gender or age difference in the prevalence of TTV infection. Of the 192 patients with oral cancer, 57 subjects had TTV in their sera, while 80 of 249 with oral cystic disease had TTV. The prevalence of TTV was similar between the two different disease groups. Neither the serum ALT nor serum AST concentrations were different between the subjects positive and negative for TTV DNA. In hospitalized dental patients, 31.1% were infected with TTV. The prevalence of TTV was much higher than that of HBV or HCV. There was no difference in the prevalence of TTV between subjects with cancer and cysts. Dentists should maintain high standards of infection control when treating any dental patient.

AB  - Background: TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered virus with a high DNA prevalence in different populations. Its role in pathogenesis is uncertain, particularly in immunocomproraised patients. Patients and Methods: Prevalence of TTV-DNA was evaluated in a cohort of HIV-infected patients and in blood donors by nested PCR, using two different primer sets: T primers, derived from the open reading frame ORF1 region N22; B primers, derived from the untranslated region (UTR). Samples positive using T primers were also tested for TTV-DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and followed up every 4 months. Results: The overall prevalence of TTV-DNA in HIV-infected patients was 37/376 (9.8%) using T primers and 223/333 (67%) using B primers; prevalence was higher in males (167/237, 70.5% vs 56/96, 58.3%; p = 0.033) and sub-Saharan Africans (22/23, 95.6% vs 201/310, 64.8% in other areas). Discordance was also observed in blood donors: 3.8% prevalence using T primers and 51.4% using B primers (also higher in males: 57% vs 37%, p = 0.056). TTV-DNA was detected in PBMC in 20/23 (87%) TTV-positive sera. Two-thirds of the serum samples remained positive over a 2-year follow-up period. Conclusion: TTV-DNA prevalence is higher when detected with primers derived from the UTR region and was highest in male and HIV-infected sub-Saharan Africans. TTV-DNA is frequently isolated in PBMC and chronic infection is common.

AB  - Objective. To assess the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection in a series of patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, with or without benign (mixed cryoglobulinemia) or malignant (B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL)) lymphoproliferative disease. Methods. Sixty-six HCV patients were studied, including patients with mixed cryoglobulinemia (n = 30), B-NHL (n = 15), and no mixed cryoglobulinemia or B-NHL (n = 21). All HCV patients had increased transaminase levels and were HCV RNA positive. Patients were considered to have mixed cryoglobulinemia if two successive determinations of their serum cryoglobulin level were above 0.05 g/L. Mixed cryoglobulinemia-negative patients never had mixed cryoglobulins in their serum on multiple determinations. Subjects without HCV infection included 79 patients with histologically proven B-NHL, and 50 healthy blood donors. Serum samples were analyzed for TTV DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction, with two couples of primers in different regions of the genome, in two independent laboratories. Results. In the group of HCV-positive patients, TTV DNA was found in one of 15 (6.7%) patients with B-NHL, and in nine of 51 (17.6%, P = 0.43) of those without B-NHL. Among HCV-positive patients without B-NHL, TTV DNA was more frequently found in those with type II mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis than in those without it (six of 16 (37.5%) versus two of 21 (9.5%),P = 0.05). In subjects without HCV infection, TTV DNA was present in 10 of 79 (12.7%) patients with B-NHL and in seven of 50 (14.0%, P = 0.82) blood donors. Conclusion. In patients chronically infected with HCV, TTV co-infection: (1) is not associated with the presence of B-NHL; and (2) is more frequently found in patients presenting a type II mixed cryoglobulinemia vasculitis.

AB  - Background: TTV is a newly discovered virus and little is known about the frequency of TTV infection in children in Poland. The aim of our study was to investigate the frequency of TTV infection in children with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. Material/Methods: Two patient groups were tested: 74 patients with chronic hepatitis B aged 4 to 20 years, and 13 patients with chronic hepatitis C aged 10 to 18 years. Nucleic acids were extracted from serum using the spin column technique (QIAGEN®, Hilden, Germany), and TTV DNA sequences were amplified by nested PCR. Results: TTV DNA was found in 47.3% of patients with chronic hepatitis B and in 53.8% of patients with hepatitis C. Among those patients with chronic B hepatitis there was no statistical difference between the frequency of coinfection with TTV and clinical-histopathological diagnosis, activity of aminotransaminases, frequency of seroconversion of HBeAg to antiHBe, or interferon alpha therapy. Conclusion: In Poland, TTV viremia is frequent in patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and C. TTV coinfection did not modify the course and activity of chronic hepatitis B or influence the outcome of interferon therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a simple, sensitive, specific and less-costly method for detecting genotypes of TT virus (TTV). METHODS: TTV DNA was tested by nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) in sera from 180 patients with different types of viral hepatitis and 96 normal individuals in Beijing. TTV genotypes were determined in 40 sera collected from TTV DNA positive patients by heteroduplex mobility assay (HMA) and through sequencing. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV DNA in viral hepatitis patients and normal individuals were 22.2% (40/180) and 19.8% (19/96), respectively (chi(2) = 0.220, P = 0.639). TTV DNA positive rates of patients with hepatitis A, B, C, E and non-A to E were 20.0% (6/30), 16.7% (5/30), 23.3% (7/30), 36.7% (11/30) and 18.3% (11/60), respectively. Of 40 TTV DNA positive patients, 20 (50.0%) were TTV G1, 7 (17.5%) TTV G2, 10 (25.0%) coinfected with different genotypes of TTV, and 3 untyped by HMA. Twenty G1 and 7 G2 detected by HMA were confirmed by sequence analysis. Of 10 patients coinfected with different genotypes of TTV, 5 were G1 and G2, 2 G1 and G3, 1 G1 and G4, 1 G1 and G3, and 1 with G1, G2 and G3 coinfections. CONCLUSION: HMA was recognized as simple, sensitive, specific and less-costly, thus could be used for genotyping of TTV.

AB  - Serum samples from healthy and diseased children were studied for the presence of TTV DNA by nested PCR using primer sets generated from N-22 region and from the untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome. N-22 positive TTV DNA was detectable in 33 (27%) of 122 healthy children, 47 (73.4%) of 64 polytransfused thalassemic children, 37 (46.3%) of 80 children who received transfusion during cardiac surgery, 8 (42.1%) of 19 non-A to E hepatitis, 10 (33.3%) of 30 HBV carrier children, and 5 (15.6%) of 32 infants with biliary atresia. A much higher prevalence of TTV DNA with rates varying from 78-100% in the above study groups was observed using the UTR primers. For children with N-22 positive TTV DNA, biochemical assessment of isolated TTV viremia in thalassemic children or children transfused during surgery showed no convincing association between raised ALT levels and TTV viremia. Coinfection with TTV in chronic HCV-infected or HBV-infected children did not result in higher peak ALT levels during follow-up, suggesting that TTV has no synergistic pathogenic effect. The phylogenetic analysis of the N-22 positive TTV DNA isolates revealed that most isolates from healthy children, children transfused during surgery, and non-A to E fulminant hepatitis children were type 1 TTV. These results indicate that TTV infection in children was significantly associated with transfusion. TTV infection is highly prevalent in early childhood in Taiwan but plays a minimal role in the induction of hepatitis in children. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Non-A-E hepatitis and acute cryptogenic hepatitis are the names given to the disease of patients with clinical hepatitis, but in whom serologic evidence of A-E hepatitis has not been found. Over a period of 8 years, we evaluated in Brazil 32 patients who fulfilled the criteria for this diagnosis in order to determine patterns of the clinical illness, laboratory parameters, or histologic features. Each patient was subjected to virologic tests to exclude A-E hepatitis and cytomegalovirus/Epstein-Barr virus infection. Drug-induced hepatitis and autoimmune disease were also excluded. Wilson's disease was excluded in young patients. The course of the disease was clinical/biochemical recovery in 3 months in 25 patients and persistent alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation in 7 patients. Three of these had chronic hepatitis, and one had severe fibrosis on liver biopsy. During the acute illness, mean peak ALT was 1267 IU/L, bilirubin was 4.0 mg/dL, and ferritin was 1393 IU/mL. GB virus type C (GBV-C) was found in six patients, and TT virus (TTV) in five patients. We conclude that, in Brazil, non-A-E hepatitis probably originates from still unidentified viruses. The course of the disease and the histologic patterns are similar to those recorded for known viruses. Continuous survey for the specific etiologic agents is needed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To study the variation of the hemorheology and microcirculation in different period of liver diseases. METHODS: Indices for hemorheology, liver function, HBV DNA and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) DNA were measured in 82 patients with liver diseases and correlative analysis was made. RESULTS: The low-shear whole blood viscosity (BV) and RBC aggregation index were significantly higher in hepatitis B group than those in the control group (P less than 0.05). No correlation was found between HBV DNA and indices of hemorheology (P greater than 0.05). The high-shear and low-shear BV and hematocrit (HCT) were significantly lower in decompensated cirrhosis group than those in the control group (P less than 0.05). RBC aggregation index, plasma viscosity (PV) and the low-shear BV were significantly higher in compensated cirrhosis group than those in the control group (P less than 0.05). The high-shear and low-shear BV were significantly higher in TTV positive group than those in the control group. CONCLUSION: There is disturbance of microcirculation in the body of patients with hepatitis B or TTV infection. The blood of patients with compensated cirrhosis is in highly viscose status and in low viscose status in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. TTV seems to be harmful to some degree to the body. The hemorheology should be an index in detecting liver diseases in addition to HBV markers.

AB  - Approximately 20% of acute and chronic and 50-80% of fulminant hepatitis cases are neither attributable to any of the known Hepatitis A, B, C, D or E viruses, nor to other agents. Clinical and experimental data suggest the existence of yet unknown viruses as causative for these diseases. Therefore research focuses on the identification of such particles. During this search novel viruses have been recently found which will be summarized in the following paper. GB virus-C/ Hepatitis G virus was discovered in 1995/96 and is a worldwide spread virus with a prevalence of 1-2% in the general population. It is mainly transmitted through blood products. However, after acute infection only a minority of patients experience transient and clinically mild elevation of transaminases. The impact of GB virus-C/Hepatitis G virus on chronic liver disorder is very limited and probably restricted to single cases. Recently, studies were published which showed a surprising protective effect of the hepatitis G virus in HGV-coinfected HIV-patients. Several independent investigators demonstrated that the mortality decreased in coinfected patients and that progression to AIDS was slower. The pathogenetic mechanisms may be the inhibition of the HIV replication. TT virus, isolated in the late 1997 in Japan, is unique in terms of its high prevalence in the general population. In Germany, it is supposed that TTV sequences are detectable in 13-40% of healthy individuals. This may be due to its routes of transmission and ability to persist in the organism. However, up to now, there is lack of evidence for a pathogenetic role in hepatic- or extrahepatic diseases. SEN virus, which was only discovered last year transfusion transmissible agent. Up to now 8 genotypes were identified which may have different pathogenetic properties. Genotypes D and H, which were mostly studied, an association to acute posttransfusion hepatitis could be described. However, due to the limited study population the dates have to be interpreted with caution.

AB  - Infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). A novel human DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), has been identified in children possessing characteristics as an etiologic agent, making the virus a potential candidate. Analysis of specimens from children with ALL was performed to determine if an association exists. Archived specimens (79 peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMC/bone marrow cells, BMC, and 125 cerebrospinal fluid, CSF) obtained at diagnosis and during therapy from 28 pediatric patients were tested for TTV. All of the diagnostic BMC/PBMC were negative for TTV, but 7 patients had follow-up specimens that converted to TTV positivity. TTV was not detected in any CSF. The absence of TTV at diagnosis suggests TTV is unlikely to be causally associated with ALL in the cases analyzed. However, the data support TTV transmission through blood products and suggest that the CNS is not a sanctuary site for TTV.

AB  - Objective: Little is known about the prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection in renal transplant recipients (RTxs) and its effects on allograft survival. We investigated the prevalence of TTV and its effects on liver injury and graft survival in RTxs. Material and Methods: The study was performed in 33 consecutive RTxs (8 females, 25 males) and 100 blood donors (35 females, 65 males). A nested polymerase chain reaction was used to detect TTV DNA in serum. Serum creatinine and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and 24-h protein excretion were determined in both TTV-positive and -negative patients. The total number of blood transfusions, the duration of hemodialysis and the total duration after transplantation were recorded in RTxs. In addition, hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis G virus DNA antibodies were determined in all patients. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 51.5% of RTxs and in 7% of the control group and this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). In the RTx group, 64.7% of TTV-positive and 56.2% of TTV-negative patients had undergone a previous blood transfusion. However, the blood transfusion replacement rate, total duration of dialysis therapy and post-transplant period did not differ between these two groups. Five (15.1%) patients in the RTx group had abnormal liver function tests (ALT >40 IU/1). Of these patients, 2 were anti-HCV-positive, 1 was HBsAg-positive and anti-HCV- plus TTV DNA-positive and the serologic tests of the remaining 2 patients were all negative. Among the TTV-positive patients, 2 (11.7%) were anti-HCV-positive, 1 (5.8%) was HBsAg-positive and 3 (17.6%) were HGV DNA-positive. The baseline serum creatinine levels did not differ significantly between the TTV-positive and -negative patients, being 1.5 ± 0.6 and 1.4 ± 0.6 mg/d1, respectively (p > 0.05). Two of the TTV-positive patients and 1 of the TTV-negative patients had proteinuria. A 1-year follow-up of TTV-positive and -negative patients demonstrated neither acute nor chronic graft rejection. Conclusion: In RTxs, TTV infection was more prevalent than in the normal population. In our patients the virus did not have an important effect on renal graft rejection and did not cause liver injury. However, the question of whether TTV infection may affect graft survival requires further long-term investigation in larger groups.

AB  - Aim: We aimed to examine the distribution and activation of peripheral T cells in TTV positive (n = 32) and negative (n = 17) hemodialyzed patients. The control group (n = 20) consisted of healthy blood donors. Method: TTV-DNA was detected by seminested PCR. CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, CD3/HLA-DR, CD3/CD69 and the Th1/Th2 ratio of T cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. Circulating IFN-γ, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13, TNF-α, TGF-β levels were measured by ELISA in the sera. Results: There was no difference between the CD3, CD4, CD8 and CD19 values of HD subjects. In addition, the expression of both activation markers, HLA-DR and CD69, was significantly elevated in the TTV-positive and -negative HD groups compared to the controls, but not showing any difference from each other. The measurements of intracellular cytokines showed the enhanced occurrence of INF-γ + CD4 T cells, and decreased appearance of IL-4 + CD4 lymphocytes in the HD groups without any significant difference between the TTV virus positive and negative patients. In addition, HD also elevated the expression of IL-10 in CD4 and CD8 (Th2) cells. There were only two significant changes in the levels of circulating cytokines: (a) IL-2 increased; (b) IL-13 decreased in both groups of HD patients compared to the controls, independently of TTV positvity or negativity. Conclusions: We assume that transfusion-transmitted virus does not cause any specific change in the distribution and activation of lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of hemodialyzed patients. Hemodialysis itself, however, results in a significant activation of peripheral T cells with the domination of increased production of Th1 type cytokines, IFN-γ, IL-2, in contrast to the decreased synthesis of Th2 type cytokines, IL-4 and IL-13. Furthermore, the increased expression of IL-10 in the CD4 and CD8 cells of HD patients can be the sign of a contraregulatory Th2 activation as an answer on the Th1 effect. Copyright © 2002 S.

AB  - The potential role of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in determining liver damage is poorly understood and no information exists about TTV replication within hepatocytes. In this study, we assess TTV in situ PCR in liver tissue. Twenty-one patients with different degrees of liver damage were studied by both serum TTV-DNA detection and in situ TTV PCR analysis and extractive PCR in liver biopsy paraffin sections (FFPE). Extractive PCR and in situ PCR detected TTV-DNA both in serum and liver tissue of five patients. The presence of TTV in serum matched with that found in the liver and TTV sequences were never found independently in liver or serum. Four out of five TTV-DNA-positive patients have not other known cause of liver damage while in one a coinfection from HCV was observed. Our data indicate that in situ PCR appears to be a reliable tool for the detection of TTV-DNA in FFPE, and may help detecting unknown origin of liver damage.

AB  - Sera from 269 Hmong people (102 males and 167 females, with mean age 35.4 years, range 16-63 years) were examined in order to determine the seroprevalence of hepatitis virus infection. The seroprevalence rates for HAV (hepatitis A virus), HBV (hepatitis B virus), HCV (hepatitis C virus), HDV (hepatitis D virus), HEV (hepatitis E virus), HGV (hepatitis G virus) and TTV (TT virus) infection were 87.8% (n=140), 76.0% (n=150), 2.0% (n=150), 0.7% (n=150), 6.5% (n=139), 5.3% (n=94) and 25.6% (n=121) respectively. The rate for carriers of HBV (HBsAg) was 13.8 % (20.5% in males and 9.6% females) with a peak prevalence in the 21-40 year age group. A high rate of HAV seropositivity was found among the younger subjects. The rate of HEV seroprevalence was low. The prevalence of TTV-DNA was high with no difference between the sexes. HGV-RNA prevalence was low and seen primarily in males. This study indicates that the Hmong people are endemically infected with HAV and HBV infection and should be considered for targeted vaccination. The role of TTV and HGV in producing illness and hepatic disease has yet to be determined in this population.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) has a remarkable genetic heterogeneity. To study TTV evolution, phylogenetic analyses were performed on 739 DNA sequences mapping in the N22 region of ORF1. Analysis of neighbor-joining consensus trees shows significant differences between DNA and protein phylogeny. Median joining networks phylogenetic clustering indicates that DNA sequence analysis is biased by homoplasy (i.e., genetic variability not originated by descent), indicative of either hypermutation or recombination. Statistical analysis shows that the significant excess of homoplasy is due to frequent recombination among closely related strains. Recombination events imply that the transmission of TTV is not clonal and provide the necessary basis to explain (i) the high degree of genetic divergence between TTV isolates, (ii) the lack of population structure on a world scale, and (iii) the number of highly divergent strains that seems typical of this virus. We show that recombination phenomena can be detected by phylogenetic analyses in very short sequences when a sufficiently large data set is available.

AB  - Background and Objectives: Transfusion-transmitted hepatitis B virus (TT-HBV) infections, when analysed in detail provide information about the nature and relative frequency of the sources of infectious donations. These cases are therefore used to inform blood safety strategies. This study updates previous reviews of the causes of TT-HBV in order to determine whether a change may have occurred in recent years. Materials and Methods: Cases of TT-HBV reported during 1998-2001 were reviewed and the nature of the infectious donations described. These cases were compared to a previously published case series reported during 1991-97. Results: Six cases of TT-HBV have been reported in the UK between 1998 and 2001. All were the result of infectious donations collected from donors with acute HBV infection. This is in contrast to the series reported during 1991-97 when only three of 14 similar cases were caused by acute infections in donors, with the majority of incidents being the result of chronic infection in donors. Conclusions: There appears to have been a change in the relative importance of acute and chronic HBV infection in blood donors in causing TT-HBV infections. Improvements in the sensitivity of HBsAg assays and/or a decrease in the prevalence of chronic HBV infection in blood donors could explain this observation. This change may have implications for strategies to reduce the risk of TT-HBV infection.

AB  - Despite the discovery of hepatitis C and hepatitis E viruses more than 10 years ago, a remarkable number of cases of acute and chronic hepatitis remains etiologically unaccounted. In effort to find new potential hepatotropic viruses there were isolated three viral agents - hepatitis G virus (GB virus-C), TT virus and SEN virus, which extended the list of hepatotropic viruses. Infections by these newly described parenteraly transmitted viruses are common an worldwide prevalent. Their diagnosis is mostly based on evidence of specific nucleid acid by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Meanwhile the clinical relevance of these viruses wasn't unequivocally proven, further studies will be required for its definitive evaluation. However, they cannot explain most of hepatitis non-A-non-E cases and therefore discovery of another viral agents can be supposed.

AB  - Background: TT virus (TTV) DNA has been found in a large proportion of patients with different forms of non-A-G hepatitis, however the clinical importance is unclear. We aimed to determine the genotypes of TTV isolates found in blood donors and different patient groups from the western part of Turkey. Materials and Methods: TTV DNA was investigated in serum samples of 91 volunteer blood donors (BD), 105 thalassemia (TH) patients, ten patients with fulminant hepatitis (FH) and 16 hemodialysis (HD) patients by heminested PCR using primers NG059, NG061 and NG063 from the ORF1 region. 39 isolates were genotyped by analyzing the partial sequence of ORF1. Results: TTV DNA was found in 75% of HD, 80% of FH, 61% of TH patients and in 51.6% of BD. Among the sequenced isolates, 14 (35.9%) belonged to genotype 1 (G1) and 25 (64.1%) belonged to genotype 2 (G2). Among the G2 sequences, 22 were grouped as G2c. Conclusion: TTV infection was common in the population studied, even with moderately sensitive primers. G2 was the major genotype of the studied population without any significant differences in distribution between various patient groups and BD.

AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) and GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) infection and the association with raised liver function tests in 546 Taiwanese with negative HBsAg, anti-HCV and HCV RNA was elucidated. They were tested for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-envelope protein 2 antibody (anti-E2) and TTV DNA. Direct sequencing and phylogenetic analyses were performed on 58 isolates for TTV genotype determination. The prevalence of TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA, anti-E2 and over all GBV-C/HGV exposure was 24.9, 3.4, 8.2 and 11.1%, respectively. Using uni- and multivariate analyses, male gender and TTV viremia were associated significantly with raised ALT values. Sixty-nine percent of TTV isolates were deduced to be TTV genotype 1 and they had significantly lower mean age than genotype non-1 isolates. In the population, raised ALT may be related to male gender and be attributable to TTV infection but not to GBV-C/HGV among individuals with no evidence of current HBV and HCV infection. TTV genotype 1 is the most prevalent genotype and associated with younger age.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is a recently discovered transfusion-transmissible DNA virus. Its frequency and clinical impact has not been established in cancer patients in Turkey. In this study, we determined the prevalence of TTV DNA positivity, and its relationship with history of transfusion, amount of transfusion, age and sex in patients with hematological and solid malignancies. Sixty-one patients (35 male and 26 female) followed up for various malignancies and 45 healthy subjects were included in the study. TTV DNA was assayed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV DNA was detected in 18 of 61 patients (29.5%) and in 5 of 45 control subjects (11.1%). In cancer patients, the prevalence of TTV DNA positivity was higher to comparison with control group. In addition, the prevalence of TTV DNA positivity was significantly higher in 22 patients who had a history of blood transfusion in the last 6 months than 39 patients who had no current or past history of transfusion (40.9% vs 23.0% respectively). These results suggest that the prevalence of TTV DNA is high and the parenteral route is an important mode of transmission for TTV in cancer patients. In addition, the high prevalence and persistence of TTV in cancer patients with parenteral risk exposure could be related to the immunodeficiency due to cancer and high viral loads by parenteral route.

AB  - Testing of the DNA of TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) was done with serum samples obtained from 184 patients (children and adults) who visited different outpatient clinics at a university hospital in Florianopolis, south of Brazil. TLMV DNA was detected by PCR primers from the non-coding region of the genome. A global TLMV prevalence of 78% was found (94% among children below 11 years). PCR products from three serum samples (patients A-C) were cloned, and the sequences with a length of 201-227 nucleotides were determined for 16-19 clones derived from each of the sera. Among the 16 clones derived from patient C, 15 were identical, and the remaining one had a sequence homology of 99%. In contrast, eight different sequences were obtained among the 19 clones derived from patient A, and 10 distinct sequences were depicted among the 17 clones derived from the serum of patient B. Additionally, 13 clones derived from a saliva sample of patient B were sequenced, and seven different nucleotide sequences obtained. One particular sequence was predominant in both serum (8/17 clones) and saliva (7/13 clones) of patient B. On a phylogenetic tree, sequences derived from patient A (a 6-year-old boy), as well as those derived from patient B (a 24-year-old man), were located in five distinct evolutionary branches, taking a minimum divergence of 5% between branches. This suggested that adults and children are coinfected frequently with several TLMV isolates of different origins. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - AIM: To investigate the prevalence of TT virus in patients with liver diseases and the association between liver diseases and TTV, especially genotype G1. METHODS: TTV DNA in serum were examined in 83 patients with non A-non E hepatitis,75 patients with chronic liver diseases and 105 general people. TTV was detected by PCR with two sets of primers, one of which was located in the 5′ UTR and the other was in the ORF1. The genotyping assay was based on RFLP. Some PCR products were sequenced. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV were 95.2%, 93.3% and 87.6% in patients with nonA-nonE hepatitis, patients with liver diseases and general people respectively. There were no significant differences among the rates (P >0.05). The positive rates of genotype G1 were 32.5%, 38.7% and 19.0% in three groups respectively. The positive rates of G1 in patients with nonA-nonE hepatitis and in patients with liver diseases were significantly higher than that in the general people (P <0.05, P <0.01). But there were no significant differences in age, gender, level of ALT and frequency of blood transfusion history between genotype G1 positive and negative patients with nonA-nonE hepatitis. The positive rate of genotype G1 was 25.0% in patients with liver cirrhosis or carcinoma associated with HBV infection and 37.1% in patients with chronic B hepatitis. There were no significant differences between them (P >0.05). The positive rate of G1 was 40% in patients with liver cirrohosis or carcinoma associated with HCV infection and 100% in patients with chronic C hepatitis. There were no significant differences between them (P >0.05). There was no significant difference in age, gender, levels of ALT between G1 positive and negative patients with chronic B hepatitis or HBsAg carrier (P >0.05). TTV-positive rate in the general people aged 21-30 (72.2%) was significantly lower than that, in the general people aged 31-40 (96.2%, P <0.01) and aged 41-50 (93.1%, P<0.05). The positive rate of G1 infection in the general people was not related to age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: There is very high prevalence of TTV infection in general population and patients with liver diseases. Genotype G1 is associated with liver disease, however, its pathogenicity may be very weak.

AB  - Known hepatitis infections among haemodialysis patients include hepatitis B, hepatitis C, hepatitis G and TT virus. Haemodialysis patients with hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C infection may progress to develop significant morbidity, such as cirrhosis, hepatitic failure or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hepatitis B infection may be treated with α-interferon or lamivudine. Hepatitis C infection may be treated with α-interferon, but frequent severe adverse effects were observed, while ribavirin is contraindicated for patients with renal failure. Treatment for hepatitis B and/or hepatitis C are costly, and the risk of post-transplant reactivation of hepatitis has been reported. Prevention of nosocomial transmission of hepatitis infection with strict infection control and universal precautions is more important. Accumulating evidence suggests that both hepatitis G virus and TT virus (TTV) are not significant causes of liver disease. Routine screening for hepatitis G or TTV viraemia in haemodialysis patients is not indicated at present.

AB  - In 1997, a new DNA virus was cloned by a Japanese team and designated TT virus (TTV). This virus seemed to be associated with non-A, non-G post-transfusion hepatitis. It was isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was presumed to be human Circoviridae. The virus is heterogenous; 16 different genotypes are currently registered, and it can be classified as a "swarm" of at least 5 different viruses. Depending on the PCR technique used, the prevalence of infection ranges from 1.9 to 36% among blood donors, from 11.5 to 71% in hemodialysis patients, from 47 to 82% among patients with non-A, non-B or non-C fulminant hepatic failure, and the most elevated percentage is found in hemophiliacs. Epidemiological studies have established that the routes of TTV infection might be parenteral, oral-fecal, and possibly salivary. Mother-to-infant transmission is controversial. TTV may play a role in the pathogenesis of non-A, non-B or non-C fulminant hepatic failure. Patients co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TTV have a significantly higher histological grade score than patients with isolated HCV infection. Treatment with interferon seems to decrease TT viremia, according to results obtained outside the context of clinical trials. TTV seems to be a light pathogenic virus. Its widespread presence in the blood of infected subjects contrasts with the apparent absence of pathological symptoms. PCR standardization is needed to clearly establish its real prevalence worldwide.

AB  - To determine TT virus (TTV) prevalence and the persistence of viremia, we prospectively did cross-sectional and longitudinal studies using by the polymerase chain reaction to test the successive sera of 150 Japanese hemodialysis patients and compared these with those of 166 residents of a rural Japanese area endemic for hepatitis C virus (HCV). TTV DNA positivity was significantly higher in 50 (30.1%) of the residents than in 25 (16.7%) of the patients in 1997 (P < 0.05). TTV DNA positively in the patients was not associated with HCV RNA positivity and also increased with the number of blood transfusions and decreased with the duration of hemodialysis, but not significantly. Longitudinal study from 1997 to 1999 showed that persistent TTV DNA positivity was found significantly more often in 35 (21.1%) of the residents than in 13 (8.6%) of the patients (P < 0.05), and that persistent TTV DNA negativity was found significantly more often in 103 (68.7%) of the patients than in 91 (54.8%) of the residents (P < 0.05). Of the 25 patients and 50 residents TTV DNA positive in 1997, TTV DNA was eliminated more often in 12 (48.0%) patients than in 15 (30.0%) residents over the three years, but the difference was not significant. The route of TTV transmission might differ from HCV in that it could be nonparenteral. TTV was less prevalent in hemodialysis patients than residents, and the virus was more often eliminated by hemodialysis patients than by residents during the three-year observation period, possibly because of the effect of the hemodialysis procedure.

AB  - Objectives: To assess current knowledge of sexually transmitted viral hepatitis in relation to epidemiology, clinical presentation, management, and diagnosis with particular reference to resource-poor settings. Method: A search of published literature identified through Medline from 1966 to October 2001, the Cochrane Library, and reference lists taken from each article obtained. Textword and MeSH searches for hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G, delta, GB virus, GBV-C, and TT virus were linked to searches under the textword terms sex$, prevent$, and MeSH subheadings, microbiology, complications, drug therapy, therapy, diagnosis, epidemiology, transmission, and prevention and control. Conclusions: In heterosexual relationships, hepatitis B is readily transmitted sexually and hepatitis C and D less so, with no evidence for sexual transmission of hepatitis A. Hepatitis types A-D are all transmissible sexually in male homosexual relationships under certain conditions. In resource-poor countries sexual transmission is generally only a significant route of transmission for hepatitis B.

AB  - Changes in viraemia of two chronically replicating circoviruses, TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV), were investigated in patients developing HIV-related immune deficiency. In a few cases, episodes of a considerable increase in viraemia were observed, but in most patients there were no discernible increases as immune deficiency progressed. The deterioration of immune function associated with AIDS did not by itself have any obvious effect on TTV and TLMV.

AB  - Objective. To determine whether the transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) is hepatotropic. Methods. Total DNA was extracted from various tissues of 5 experimentally infected Rhesus monkeys during the viremic period. A dot hybridization was done with viral double stranded DNA probes or single antisense probes. Results. The double-stranded probe was hybridized with DNA from the liver, bone marrow, spleen, stomach, small intestine and colon. The single-stranded antisense probe was hybridized with DNA from the liver, small intestine and bone marrow of all 5 monkeys, but not with that from other tissues. Conclusions. As the viral genome was of negative polarity, the plus-stranded fragment identified in our study might be a replicative intermediate, and was only demonstrated in the liver, small intestine, and bone marrow by dot blot hybridization with single-stranded antisense probes. It is suggested that the TTV replicates in the liver, bone marrow and small intestine, and TTV might be hepatotropic.

AB  - The development of new technologies leads to the discovery of new viruses. For each of these new infectious agents, relevance to transfusion, including transmissibility by transfusion, pathogenicity, prevalence in blood donors, persistence and the availability of screening assays needs to be assessed. Since 1995, one virus and a new family of viruses have been identified. GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV), a flavi virus with some homology with and epidemiological features of HCV, is not related to post-transfusion hepatitis but seems to positively interfere with human immunodeficiency virus replication. Human circoviruses include TT virus (TTV) and SEN-V. Both are highly variable, constituting a large family of distantly related viruses. They appear ubiquitous, infecting humans very early in life and are largely persistent. No clinical symptoms or pathogenicity is associated with TTV, but SEN-V might be associated with some non-A-E post-transfusion hepatitis. Parvovirus B19 has been known for many years, but its transmission to recipients of plasma derivatives despite viral inactivation raised the issue of screening plasma pools by nucleic acid testing. Most fractionators quantify B19 DNA in plasma pools to ensure a viral load of &lt;104IU mL-1.

AB  - The public expects a zero-tolerance policy for the transmission of infectious agents by blood transfusion. Although unrealistic, the efforts to reach this goal have produced an extremely safe albeit costly blood supply [82]. Blood collecting agencies, the FDA, physicians, and scientists have over the past 20 years created a complex system of layers of protection to interdict transfusion-transmitted infections (Fig. 2). As new, exotic, potentially blood transmittable infectious agents evolve [83], new barriers will be erected to interdict these agents. In the interim, the US blood supply is the safest in the world.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV) load was estimated in sera obtained from 237 patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related chronic liver disease including 42 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by real-time detection PCR using primers and a probe derived from the well-conserved untranslated region of the TTV genome, which can detect all known TTV genotypes. Of the 237 patients studied, 18 (8%) were negative for TTV DNA, 87 (37%) had low TTV viremia (1.3 × 102-9.9 × 103 copies/ml), and 132 (56%) had high TTV viremia (1.0 × 104-2.1 × 106 copies/ml). Various features were compared between the patients with high TTV load (n = 132) and those with no TTV viremia or low viral load (n = 105). High TTV viremia (≥104 copies/ml) was significantly associated with higher age (P &lt; 0.05), past history of blood transfusion (P &lt; 0.001), complication of cirrhosis (P &lt; 0.05) or HCC (P &lt; 0.0005), lower HCV RNA titer (P &lt; 0.05), and lower platelet count (P &lt; 0.01). On multivariate logistic regression analysis, high TTV viral load was a significant risk factor for HCC (P &lt; 0.05), independent from known risk factors such as complication of liver cirrhosis (P &lt; 0.0001) and high age (≥65 years, P &lt; 0.05), among all 237 patients. Furthermore, high TTV viral load was an independent risk factor for HCC among the 90 cirrhotic patients (P &lt; 0.05). These results suggest that a high TTV viral load is associated independently with the complication of HCC and may have prognostic significance in patients with HCV-related chronic liver disease, although whether high TTV viremia mediates the progression of HCV-related chronic liver disease remains to be defined. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus-like minivirus (TLMV) was recently discovered as a human circovirus. Little is known about its natural history and molecular epidemiology. A study of TLMV infection is described in a population of French hemodialysis patients. TLMV DNA was tested by seminested PCR system located in the noncoding region in 81 patients divided into seven groups according to the origin of their renal disease. Quantitation of TLMV DNA in serum was carried out. Sequences from 28 patients were compared with 40 sequences retrieved from databases and 53 TLMV sequences cloned from the serum of a single patient. The prevalence of TLMV DNA in hemodialysis patients was 95.1%. In this study, 24 samples (29.6%) presented viral loads of &gt; 125 equivalents of plasmid (Ep)/ml, and only 6 (7.8%) had viral loads of &gt; 125 × 102 Ep/ml. A significant correlation (P &lt; 0.029) was found between viral loads of &gt; 125 × 102 Ep/ml and the neoplastic origin of end-stage renal disease. Analysis of 53 sequences cloned from a single individual demonstrated high sequence variability, as shown by the genetic distance of 40.2%. This genetic distance is comparable to that between the most divergent sequences of TLMV reported to date (43.5%). These data suggest that TLMV viral load is possibly related to the level of immunocompetence of hemodialysis patients; the genetic diversity of TLMV is extremely high; and co-infection by different strains is possible. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background/Aims: Hepatitis A and E viruses (HAV, HEV) are transmitted enterically and are highly endemic in India. This study aims to evaluate prevalence of these and TT virus (TTV) in the sewage. Methods: Influent and effluent samples from a sewage treatment plant from Pune, India were collected twice a week for 1 year and subjected to nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the detection of HAV RNA, HEV RNA and TTV DNA. HAV and HEV PCR products were sequenced. Effluent samples were not collected for 5 months as the plant was non-functional. Results: The overall prevalence was 24.42% (21/86, HAV), 10.98% (9/82, HEV) and 12.7% (8/63, TTV). Prevalence of HAV was significantly higher than HEV (P = 0.023). During summer months, significantly higher HAV RNA positivity was noted (P < 0.01). A substantial reduction in HAV RNA positivity (15/48 vs. 2/48, P = 0.0008) was recorded for treated sewage samples. However, HEV RNA or TTV DNA positivity did not reduce significantly. Of the 17 HAV and HEV RNA negative sewage samples concentrated using ultracentrifugation, 13 and none were positive for HAV and HEV RNA, respectively. Phylogenetic analyses grouped these viruses in IB and Ia, respectively, the genotypes most prevalent in India. Conclusions: Sewage may play an important role in maintaining hyper-endemicity of these infections. Sustained efforts are obligatory to render sewage less/non-infectious. © 2002 European Association for the Study of the Liver. Published by Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background/Aims: A novel DNA virus which was designated TT virus (TTV) in 1997 was considered a possible hepatitis-related virus, like hepatitis C (HCV), hepatitis B (HBV) and GB virus C/hepatitis G viruses (GBV-C/HGV). In the present study, the molecular epidemiology and clinical significance of TTV, GBV-C/HGV and HCV infection in hemodialysis patients from Taiwan are investigated. Methods: Sera of 85 patients on maintenance hemodialysis were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), second-generation HCV antibody (anti-HCV), anti-envelope protein 2 antibody (anti-E2) and RNA of GBV-C/HGV, HCV RNA and TTV DNA. Sera of patients with positive TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA or HCV RNA were tested for viruses 2 years later. Results: Seven (8.2%) 29 (34.1%), 21 (24.7%), 12 (14.1%) and 9 (10.6%) hemodialysis patients were positive for HBsAg, Anti-HCV, HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and anti-E2, respectively. TTV DNA was positive in 46 (54.1%) patients. Neither clinical nor virological factors were associated with TTV viremia. The ALT level was significantly elevated in HCV RNA-positive individuals than -negative ones (34.5 vs. 12.5%, p < 0.05). TTV DNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and HCV RNA remained detectable in sera of 31 (86.1%), 6 (50%) and 21 (100%) patients collected 2 years after first diagnosis of viremia. Conclusion: Among Taiwanese hemodialysis patients, TTV infection is highly prevalent. No clinical or virological factor was observed to be significantly associated with TTV infection. The ALT abnormality was mainly attributable to HCV but not TTV infection in Taiwanese hemodialysis patients. Copyright © 2002 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) has recently been identified in patients with post-transfusion non-A, non-G hepatitis. It is reported to be common in patients with a variety of liver diseases and with history of transfusion. Its pathogenesis in chronic liver diseases remains unclear. In this study, we have determined the prevalence of TTV in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) population and related its prevalence with history of previous hemodialysis, transfusion, HCV positivity and serum alanine amino-transferase (ALT) levels. TTV was detected in 44% of 63 CAPD patients and 30% of 43 healthy controls (p = 0.15). Frequency of TTV was similar in previously hemodialysed and never hemodialysed (8/14, 57% vs. 20/40, 41%, p = 0.15) and previously transfused and non-transfused (7/19, 37% vs. 15/44, 34%) CAPD patients. Prevalence of TTV was also similar in HCV(+) and HCV(-) patients. Serum ALT levels were 19 ± 16 and 20 ± 12 U/l in TTV(+) and TTV(-) patients, respectively. These results indicate that prevalence of TTV in a CAPD population is similar to healthy controls, and other routes of transmission in addition to parenteral routes might be involved in the transmission of TTV.

AB  - The platelet count increases after a sustained response to interferon (IFN) treatment for chronic hepatitis C (CH-C). However, the extent of the increase differs by patient. We investigated whether concurrent TT virus (TTV) infection interferes with the improvement of thrombocytopenia. Serial serum samples were obtained from 85 noncirrhotic CH-C patients who achieved a sustained virologic response for hepatitis C virus (HCV) upon IFN treatment, and tested for TTV DNA by three polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (UTR, N22 and TTV genotype-1). UTR PCR can detect essentially all TTV genotypes, whereas N22 PCR primarily detects four major TTV genotypes (1-4). Eighty-four patients (84/85, 99%) were positive for TTV DNA by UTR PCR, 27 (32%) by N22 PCR and 18 (21%) by TTV genotype-1 PCR just before IFN treatment was started (baseline). A sustained virologic response for TTV was observed in 6% (5/84) by UTR PCR, 52% (14/27) by N22 PCR and 56% (10/18) by TTV genotype-1 PCR. The platelet count was significantly lower in the N22 PCR-positive group than in the N22 PCR-negative group not only at baseline (14.9 ± 3.8 vs. 18.1 ± 6.4 × 104/μl, P &lt; 0.05), but also at the non-HCV-viremic state one year after the completion of IFN treatment (15.5 ± 2.8 vs. 18.6 ± 5.5 × 104/μl, P &lt; 0.05), the differences also being statistically significant by TTV genotype-1 PCR, but not by UTR PCR. These results suggest that certain TTV genotypes including genotype 1 may play a role in aggravating the thrombocytopenia of CH-C patients, either alone or in concert with HCV. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was found in 1997 from a hepatitis patient without virus markers. However, the real impact of TTV on liver diseases remains uncertain to date. Due to the lack of suitable cell systems to support the growth of TTV, the biology of TTV is still obscure. This review tries to summarise the current status of TTV on aspects other than the taxonomic diversity of TTV. TTV was the first human virus with a single stranded circular DNA genome. TTV was considered to be a member of Circoviridae, but others suggested it conformed to a new family. TTV is distinct from ambisense viruses in the genus Circovirus, since the former genome is negative stranded. The genome structure of TTV is more related to chicken anaemia virus in the genus Gyrovirus, however, the sequence similarity is minimal except for a short stretch at 3816-3851 of TA278. Currently the working group is proposing the full name for TTV as TorqueTenoVirus and the TTV-like mini virus as TorqueTenoMiniVirus (TTMV) in a new genus Anellovirus (ring). TTVs are prevalent in non-human primates and human TTV can cross-infect chimpanzees. Furthermore, TTV sequences have been detected in chickens, pigs, cows and sheep. TTV can be transmitted by mother-to-child infection. However, within a year after birth, the prevalence reaches the same level for children born to both TTV-positive and TTV-negative mothers even without breast-feeding. The noncoding region surrounding a short 113 nt GC-rich stretch and occupying approximately one-third of the genome is considered to contain the putative replication origin. Three mRNAs are expressed by TTV, 3.0 and 1.2 and 1.0 kb species. A protein translated from the 3.0 kb mRNA is considered to be the major capsid protein as well as replicase. The nature of the proteins translated by the other two mRNAs are still putative. Copyright © 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - Transfusion transmitted viruses (TTV) were investigated in cardiac surgery cases who were previously transfused with blood and/or blood products and were suspected of having posttransfusion hepatitis (PTH) based on the results of physical examination, clinical findings, biochemical blood test results and in a smaller number, on radiological results. They were identified as having non-A-C hepatitis based on serological or molecular test methods. In this study, out of 90 cases suspected for PTH and non-A-C, 78 (86.7%) were male, 12 (13.3%) were female and their ages were between 17 and 67. Ninety healthy blood donors, who donated blood for the first time and had never had a transfusion, were selected as the control group. They had alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels <40 U, were seronegative for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Seventy-seven were immune, and 13 were seronegative for hepatitis A virus (HAV). In this study, TTV-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) investigation was performed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method suggested by Takahashi et al. with 5′ GCT ACG TCA CTA ACC ACG TG 3′ (T801) and 5′ CTG CGG TGT GTA AAC TCA CC 3′ (T935) primers. TTV-DNA was found to be positive in 21 (23.3%) of the patient group and 4 (4.4%) of the control group (p<0.05). In the patients determined to be TTV-DNA positive, the admission time following transfusion was a minimum of 3, and a maximum of 15 (average 7) weeks. The average ALT levels detected at the time of admission did not show a difference between TTV-DNA positive and negative cases (p>0.05). However the ALT levels had a tendency to rise and reached their highest level nine weeks after transfusion in the TTV-DNA positive cases, although in two cases the ALT levels decreased to normal value after the 13th week. During the 24 month follow up of the TTV-DNA positives all cases except one were positive at the end of this period. The results of this study are the same as those reported in the literature suggesting that TTV-DNA, excluding the main viral agents which are known to cause PTH, can be determined in transfused PTH or non-transfused asymptomatic patients in varying ratios. In order to define the epidemiological properties and hepatic-extrahepatic pathologies more clearly we have looked for evidence of the viral agent, which probably contaminates both by transfusion and non-transfusion routes. It is suggested that, in addition to the case groups in this study, new clinical studies are necessary including transfused but non-PTH patients. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Objective To determine, in Polish blood donors, the frequency of TT virus (TTV) using different primers and the sequence diversity of TTV genotypes. Materials and Methods Two-hundred blood donors were studied. TTV DNA was detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers for the coding (ORF1) and non-coding (NC) regions. Twenty isolates were genotyped by sequencing the ORF1 fragment. Results TTV DNA was detected in 78% of donors using NC primers and in 10% using ORF1 primers. The frequency of TTV DNA detection by NC primers was observed to increase with donor age, whereas the frequency of detection by ORF primers did not differ between various age-groups. The nucleotide sequence homology of Polish TTV isolates ranged from 59 to 99%. Three genotypes (1b, 2b and 2c) were identified. Conclusions The frequency of TTV detection depends on the primers used for the PCR. Using the NC primers the virus is detected in the majority of donors, whereas the ORF 1 primers strongly underestimate the prevalence of TTV. The frequency of TTV DNA increases with age. Polish TTV isolates are highly polymorphic and are classified as 1b, 2b and 2c.

AB  - Evolutionary studies on the recently discovered TT virus (TTV) are currently focused on approximately 220 nts of the N22 region, since this is the region for which most sequence information is available. Regarding the extensive sequence heterogeneity in this region, within group classification can be sufficiently reliable, however, between group classification becomes problematic. We observed high divergence at the nucleotide level between distant related strains (TTV groups) preventing unambiguous alignments, saturation in transitions within TTV groups and considerable phylogenetic noise due to conflicting signals within distinct genotypes. Consequently, analysing all TTV groups in one tree, using this 220 nt region provides unreliable results. Also within genotype analysis can produce conflicting results. On the other hand, this region is still suitable to some extent for within TTV group phylogenetic analysis. We suggest that care should be taken in future TTV phylogenetic analysis, in particular, larger and more conserved regions should be sequenced to allow between group comparisons. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - To investigate vertical transmission of TT virus, TTV-DNA was looked for in serum samples taken from 22 mothers and their 22 infants at birth and during nine months of follow-up. Sixteen mothers at delivery and six infants within nine months of age had TTV-DNA detected by the amplification of the non coding (NC) region. Two of these newborns had positive viremia at birth. Sequence analysis of the NC region of five mother-infant pairs revealed that the TTV strains detected at three and six months of age in two of the infants were closely related to that of their mothers, whereas two that became TTV-DNA positive at three moths had a different nucleotide sequence from that of their mothers. One of the two infants with detectable viremia at birth also had a different nucleotide sequence from her mother. These findings suggest that both in utero and perinatal transmission of TT virus may occur, and that the strain detected in the infants was not invariably dominant in the mothers at delivery.

AB  - TTV is a DNA virus with high genetic heterogeneity. To investigate the novel isolates of the virus, blood samples were collected from subjects who lived in various parts of China and suffered from hepatitis or were asymptomatic carriers. Nested PCR was carried out to amplify a 3.2-kb fragment using primers deduced from the prototype TTV (TA278). The ten entire 3.2-kb nt sequences were aligned with isolate TA278, SANBAN, TUS01, and SENV retrieved from GenBank, and a phylogenetic tree was constructed by Neighbor-Joining method. The analysis indicated that five novel variants of the present study have not been described before, and all TTV-related isolates could be classified into three groups. The isolate TCHN-A, B and TUS01 were included in a group, and the remaining novel isolates together with SANBAN and TA278 clustered into another group, while SEN virus formed a distinct group. The genetic distances of the five novel variants were 0.5507-0.8476 to TA278, 0.4635-0.7877 to SANBAN, 0.6064-0.7834 to TUS01 and 0.6936-0.8236 to SENV. Of these novel variants, the ORF1 consisted of 426-772 aa and ORF2 of 141-156 aa. The nt identities of ORF1 and ORF2 between those variants and TA278, SANBAN, and TUS01 were 46.1-60.8 and 48.7-63.6%, and those of aa sequences were only 27.1-52.4 and 28.9-45.5%, respectively. The first 65 aa of ORF1 were rich in arginine and most conserved with homology of 56.5-70.0%. There was a hypervariable region from aa 286 to 403 with merely 17.7-27.0% of identity. Despite a low aa identity between TA278 and the variants, they have similar hydrophilicity profiles of ORF1. There were 2-10 N-glycosylation motifs found in these variants. In conclusion, despite the high divergence, sequences of all these isolates shared common genome organisation, ORF structure, hydrophilicity patterns, and some potential motifs with TTV prototype. It is suggested that various TTV and TTV-related isolates belong to a very large and complex family, which remains to be studied. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered single-stranded DNA virus that has been reported to be associated with elevated transminase levels in the patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. TTV prevalence is very high in the common population and its pathogenicity remains unclear. In this study, we performed an epidemiological study to investigate the infection rate of TTV and its role in an epidemic of unknown-etiology hepatitis. Moreover, two TTV isolates named L01 and L02 were cloned from the serum of a patient with unknown-etiology hepatitis. Eighty-one subjects were included in the study and were divided into two groups: 18 in the case group and 63 in the control group. TTVDNA was detected by nested PCR from sera samples. The infection rates of TTV in case and control groups were 33.3 and 38.9%, respectively. There was no significant difference between the two groups. Homology analysis showed that L01 had a very poor homology with other TTV isolates and L02, and L02 was 75.5% identical to JA10. The result does not support TTV as a causative agent in this epidemic. The genetic divergence between L01 and other TTV isolates beyond genotype, so it represents a new genotype of TTV. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We studied DNA damages (single-strand breaks and alkali-labile sites) in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with chronic viral hepatitis and cirrhosis of mixed etiology. The structure of DNA was estimated fluorometrically by changes in the intensity of ethidium bromide fluorescence. Monoinfection with hepatitis B and C viruses was not accompanied by considerable changes in DNA structure in peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with chronic diseases. The incidence of DNA damages in lymphocytes increased in patients with hepatitis G virus and TTV monoinfection. This is probably related to replication of these viruses in nucleated blood cells. Our results suggest that hepatitis C virus potentiates damaging effect of hepatitis G virus on DNA in lymphocytes.

AB  - Clinical significance of TTV infection was analyzed in Egyptian hemodialysis (HD) patients. Forty-seven Egyptian patients on maintenance HD and 50 age-matched volunteer blood donors were investigated. TT virus (TTV) DNA detection and genotyping were performed using a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction with specific primers. The prevalence of TTV DNA in patients on HD (66%) was significantly (P < 0.001) higher than in blood donors (24%) with genotype 1b predominance (89%) in both. Clinical background including mean age, sex, history of blood transfusion, and positive markers for either hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) did not differ between TTV DNA positive and negative HD patients. However, the mean duration of HD was significantly (P = 0.032) shorter in the TTV positive patients (28 ± 19 months) than in the negative ones (45 ± 34 months). Mean alanine aminotransferase level in patients with HCV infection alone (41 ± 24 IU/l) did not differ from that in patients with both co-infection (33 ± 28 IU/l), but was significantly higher than that in patients with TTV infection alone (26 ± 10 IU/l). Occurrence of chronic hepatic changes in patients with TTV infection alone (7%) was significantly less common than those with HCV infection alone (100%, P < 0.001) or those with both co-infection (100%, P < 0.001). Serum level of HCV core protein was similar between patients with HCV infection alone and those with co-infection with TTV. In conclusion, the prevalence of TTV infection is high in Egyptian patients on regular HD, especially with shorter duration on HD. No clinical significance of TTV virus could be elicited in HD Egyptian patients; neither it showed any clinical impact as a co-infection with HCV. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - A novel DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), has been proposed as a possible etiologic agent for non A-E hepatitis. The aim of the present study was to determine the prevalence of TTV infection using PCR in healthy blood donors and in patients with clotting disorders who have been investigated previously for GBV-C/HGV and HCV infection in Belgium. In this study, PCR using primers proposed by Takahashi et al. [(1998) Hepatology Research 12:233-239] proved far more sensitive than those used by Okamoto et al. [(1998) Journal of Medical Virology 56:128-132]. The sequence of the PCR products showed 87% identity to the published sequence. TTV was present in 29.7% of healthy blood donors, a figure intermediate between the low rate of infection observed in Scotland and the high rates in the Far East. TTV was detected in 46.5% of 127 patients studied with clotting disorders as compared to 79.5% for HCV and 11.8% for GBV-C/HGV infection. However, there was no impact on the level of serum transaminases. Treatment with interferon for HCV infection co-infected with TTV suppressed temporarily serum TTV DNA. Therefore, it was concluded that TTV DNA is detected frequently in serum of healthy blood donors in Belgium and more often in patients with clotting disorders. TTV does not cause liver disease or contribute to the severity of liver disease. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus and TTV-like mini virus correspond to the first human circoviruses described. They do not harbour sequence homology with other animal circoviruses already described. They are both detected at high prevalences in various body fluids. Modes of spread may include the parenteral way, the transmission by saliva droplets and the fecal-oral route. Genetic variability inside a viral group is high and the coinfection by distinct viral strains is common in a given individual. TTV and TLMV harbour frequent genetic recombination events, mostly located in the non-coding part of the genomes. Although we lack information concerning the mode of viral replication, the description of several messengers RNA obtained after multiple splicing revealed a specific transcription profile. The detection of identical or highly divergent viral strains in nonhuman primates and in farm animals has been already demonstrated. Despite apparent asymptomatic infections, the possible association of variants of TTV and TLMV with a given pathology cannot be formally ruled out.

AB  - This study was done to determine the effect of freezing and thawing of serum on the stability of TTV and HBV DNA levels. Seven TTV DNA positive samples were randomly selected among the sera having HBV DNA with concentrations ranging from 12 pg/ml to 4162 pg/ml and they were frozen and thawed up to eight times and then analyzed for changes on TTV- and HBV DNA levels. TTV DNA positivity and HBV DNA concentrations were tested by using semi-nested PCR and Digene hybrid capture system, respectively. Seven cycles of freezing and thawing did not significantly change HBV DNA concentrations and TTV DNA positivity in any of the samples tested. After eight cycles, only three samples were tested, and all were positive for HBV DNA, but negative for TTV DNA. Our results show that both TTV- and HBV DNA positives continued until the seventh cycle of freezing and thawing in all samples tested.

AB  - Recombinant plasmids carrying 199 base pairs (bp) inserts from the non coding region (nucleotides (nt) 6-204) of the TT virus (TTV) genome were used to standardize an heteroduplex mobility assay able to detect mixed infections of a single individual with several TTV isolates. In this simplified heteroduplex mobility assay, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products were analyzed directly by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, without requirement for post-PCR denaturation and annealing steps of the amplicons. The assay was used to test TTV positive serum samples collected from healthy 1-7 years old children, 11-17 years old adolescents, and 24-39 years old blood donors living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, as well as TTV positive samples from Amazonian Indians. The results showed a very high frequency of multiple infection in all groups, with 20/30 (67%), 31/33 (94%), 35/38 (92%), and 34/37 (92%) of the samples collected from children, adolescents, blood donors, and Amazonian Indians, respectively, containing more than one TTV genotype. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - TT viruses have recently been reported in serum samples from varying percentages of human blood donors and in patients with chronic liver disease. However, no association with human pathology has yet been reported. In a pilot study we analysed 162 biopsy specimens from various human cancers and from colon polyps for the presence of TT virus related sequences by polymerase chain reaction using three sets of nested primers for TT virus detection. All gels were subjected to Southern blot hybridisation, and DNA from hybridising bands was cloned and sequenced. A total of 54.3% of tumour specimens contained identifiable TT virus related sequences. Specimens from hypopharynx, larynx, endometrial, ovarian and bladder cancers were 14-35% positive and gastrointestinal cancers (oesophagus, stomach, colon, rectum) and colon polyps 57-100% positive. Lung cancers (68.4%), mammary cancers (50%), multiple myelomas (85.7%) and human leukaemias (53.3%) also revealed a high prevalence of TT virus related sequences. Since normal control tissues were not available for the tumour biopsy specimens tested, these data do not permit conclusions concerning a possible causal relationship between the virus infections and carcinogenesis. Another aspect, however, deserves attention: the heterogeneity of TT virus clones obtained from the specimens tested here was striking: 66 novel sequences, probably belonging to new types were identified. Only 16 clones corresponded by more than 97% of their sequences to established prototypes. Even individual tumours commonly contained sequences substantially diverging in nucleic acid composition. Up to five different types were identified within an individual tumour. The high variability of these virus types suggests that additional primer combinations within the highly conserved region of the genome would detect a still higher rate of positive tumours.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) DNA in serum samples obtained from 24 TTV- infected infants was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with inverse primers derived from the untranslated region. The amplified PCR products were molecularly cloned; six clones each were analyzed. Seventy-six (53%) of the 144 TTV clones were classified into group 4 (YONBAN isolates), and 22 (15%) into a novel genetic group (group 5). The TTV clones in group 4 were classified into 9 types, and those in group 5 into 4 types. The entire nucleotide sequence of one representative clone each from the 13 types were determined; they comprised 3570-3770 nucleotides, and had poor homology to TTVs of groups 1-3 (TA278, PMV and SANBAN isolates). A phylogenetic tree based on the entire nucleotide sequence of open reading frame 1 confirmed the presence of five distinct clusters separated by a bootstrap value of 100%. Analysis of 13 TTV variants demonstrated preservation of the genomic organization and transcription profile in all TTV groups. TTV group 4 was detected in 54% or 72% of 7-to-12-month-old infants in Japan and China, respectively, which is comparable with that among adults in the respective country, indicating early and frequent acquisition of this TTV group in infancy.

AB  - Goals: To study transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection in 75 patients on and examine its relationship with age, sex, duration of dialysis, history of transfusion, and chronic elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. Study: Serum TTV was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TTV genotypes by restriction fragment length polymorphism, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA by PCR. Results: Transfusion-transmitted virus was detected in 32 patients (42,7%). Transfusion-transmitted virus genotypes were as follows: G1 in 16 patients; G2, 3; G3, 1; G4, 2; G2-G5, 6; and unclassified, 4. Mean duration of dialysis was 37 ± 32 months for TTV-positive patients and 43 ± 37 months for TTV-negative patients (not significant). Twenty-seven (84%) TTV-positive patients and 27 (63%) TTV-negative patients had a history of transfusions (p = 0.04). Chronic ALT elevation was observed in 9 patients; 5 of them were TTV-positive (16%) and 4 were TTV-negative (9%) (not significant). Four (40%) HCV RNA - positive patients and 5 (8%) HCV RNA - negative patients had chronic ALT elevation (p = 0.003). Three TTV-positive patients with chronic ALT elevation were also infected with HCV. The two patients with isolated TTV infection did not have another clinical feature to explain their ALT elevation. Conclusions: Transfusion-transmitted virus had a high prevalence in the patients on hemodialysis; genotype G1 accounts for half of the cases. Transfusion-transmitted virus infection depends on the transfusional antecedent but not on the duration of dialysis. Chronic ALT elevation is significantly associated with HCV infection but not TTV infection. However, TTV could be a causative agent of chronic ALT elevation in some patients.

AB  - This study assessed the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) viremia in pregnant women and evaluated the role of maternal transmission in early acquisition of TTV in infants in Taiwan. Two groups of pregnant women were screened for TTV using polymerase chain reaction. The first group included 135 healthy pregnant women attending the obstetrics department for routine prenatal care and the second group from 25 GB virus-C/ hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV)-infected mothers. In both groups, when TTV infection was found in mothers, serial serum samples were collected for the infants at regular intervals until 1 year of age and were tested for TTV DNA. The results showed that 40% (54/135) of the women undergoing routine prenatal care and 56% (14/25) of GBV-C/ HGV-infected pregnant women were positive for TTV DNA (P=0.137). Of the 54 TTV-infected mothers in the routine prenatal group, 29 and their 30 infants received regular follow-up. The positive rate of TTV DNA in infants was 40% (12/ 30) in the routine prenatal group and 29% (4/14) in the group with GBV-C/HGV-infected mothers (P=0.463). All but 2 of the 16 TTV-infected infants had normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels during follow-up. The phylogenetic analysis in 7 mother-infant pairs showed that the homology was diverse in each pair and a close genetic relatedness was found in 2 mother-infant pairs. In conclusion, TTV viremia is common in pregnant Taiwanese women and their infants. However, the results suggest that maternal transmission may play only a minor role in early acquisition of TTV in infants. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The association of the newly identified viruses, GB virus C (GBV-C) and TT virus (TTV), with autoimmune hepatitis remains to be elucidated. Sera from 20 Japanese patients with autoimmune hepatitis and 50 volunteer blood donors were assayed for GBV-C RNA, antibodies to the GBV-C second envelope protein (E2), and TTV DNA. GBV-C RNA was examined by reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Anti-GBV-C E2 (a marker of past infection) was tested by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. TTV DNA was amplified by PCR using two different sets of primers: one derived from the original N22 sequence (Set A) and the other from the untranslated region (Set B). None of the patients or controls had GBV-C RNA. Anti-GBV-C E2 was found significantly more often in patients with autoimmune hepatitis (3/20) than in controls (1/50; P=0.034). The prevalence of TTV DNA detected by primers Set A and that detected with either Set A or B were similar among patients with autoimmune hepatitis (4/20 and 16/20, respectively) and controls (9/50 and 40/50, respectively). Clinical characteristics did not differ in association with any of these viral markers. Of the 13TTV isolates amplified with Set A, seven were classified as genotype 1a, four as genotype 1b, and 2 as genotype 3; no particular strain was associated with autoimmune hepatitis. These findings provide no compelling evidence that GBV-C or TTV has a pathogenic role in autoimmune hepatitis. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background. Hepatitis G virus can cause chronic infection in man but the role of this agent in chronic liver disease is poorly understood. Little is known about the relation of another newly discovered agent, the TT virus, with chronic liver disease. Aim. To investigate the rate of infection with hepatitis G virus and TT virus in patients with cryptogenic chronic liver disease. Patients. A total of 23 subjects with chronically raised alanine transaminase and a liver biopsy in whom all known causes of liver disease had been excluded, and 40 subjects with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Methods. Evaluation of anti-hepatitis G virus by enzyme immunoassay. Hepatitis G virus-RNA by polymerase chain reaction with primers from the 5′ NC and NS5a regions. TT virus-DNA by nested polymerase chain reaction with primers from the ORF1 region. Results. Hepatitis G virus-RNA was detected in 4 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and in 6 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis (17.4% vs 15% p=ns). At least one marker of hepatitis G virus infection (hepatitis G virus-RNA and/or anti-hepatitis G virus, mostly mutually exclusive) was present in 6 out of 23 patients with cryptogenic hepatitis and 16 out of 40 with hepatitis C virus liver disease (26.1% vs 40% p=ns). TT virus-DNA was present in serum in 3 subjects, 1 with cryptogenic and 2 with hepatitis C virus-related chronic liver disease. Demographic and clinical features, including stage and grade of liver histology, were comparable between hepatitis G virus-infected and uninfected subjects. Severe liver damage (chronic hepatitis with fibrosis or cirrhosis) were significantly more frequent in subjects with hepatitis C virus liver disease. Conclusions. In Southern Italy, hepatitis G virus infection is widespread among patients with chronic hepatitis, independently of parenteral risk factors. Its frequency in subjects with cryptogenic liver disease parallels that observed in hepatitis C virus chronic liver disease, thus ruling out an aetiologic role of hepatitis G virus. TT virus infection is uncommon in patients with cryptogenic or hepatitis C virus-related liver disease who do not have a history of parenteral exposure.

AB  - Background. Infection with transfusion transmitted virus, a new member of the Parvoviridae family, has been found in patients both with chronic and fulminant post-transfusion cryptogenic hepatitis. Aim. To evaluate the prevalence and clinical impact of transfusion transmitted virus infection in Italy. Patients and Methods. Studies were carried out on 256 patients and control subjects from three centres from Northern, Central and Southern Italy (92 nonA-nonC chronic hepatitis, 10 acute non fulminant cryptogenic hepatitis, 41 hepatitis C virus-related chronic hepatitis and 113 blood donors). Serum transfusion transmitted virus was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction using two overlapping sets of primers. Results. A total of 52 of the 92 patients (54.3%) with chronic cryptogenic liver disease and 17 of the 41 hepatitis C virus chronic hepatitis patients (41.4%) were transfusion transmitted virus-DNA positive. Transfusion transmitted virus co-infection in hepatitis C virus patients was not associated with either a higher severity of liver histology or higher alanine transaminase levels or signs of cholestasis. transfusion transmitted virus was found in 48 out of 113 (42.4%) blood donors. In the majority of samples, transfusion transmitted virus DNA was detected with only one of the two sets of primers used. Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis performed on 21 randomly selected viral isolates showed the presence of both type 1 and type 2 transfusion transmitted virus and allowed identification of two isolates with high homology to genotype 6, described, so far, mostly in Japan. Conclusions. Transfusion transmitted virus type 1 and 2 infection is common among blood donors and patients with liver disease in Italy. The pathogenic potential of transfusion transmitted virus type 1 and 2 in nonA-nonC hepatitis patients is unlikely but further studies are needed to evaluate the epidemiological and clinical impact of other transfusion transmitted virus subtypes.

AB  - Background: The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) viremia, without definite clinical significance, has been reported to be higher among chronic hepatitis C patients. The status and clinical characteristics of TT virus (TTV) infection and distribution of TTV genotypes in a hepatitis C virus (HCV) hyperendemic township (Masago community) in a hepatitis B virus (HBV) endemic country (Taiwan) were investigated. Methods: Sera from 100 Masago residents were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and markers of HBV, HCV and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) and TTV-DNA. Sera of 250 blood donors as a control group were tested for TTV-DNA. Sera of Masago residents and blood donors with positive TTV-DNA were directly sequenced, and phylogenetic analyses were performed subsequently. Results: The prevalences of TTV viremia in different age groups among individuals from Masago were significantly higher than that among blood donors. In regard to the subtypes of TTV, 23, seven, two, eight, one, six and one isolate were related to the genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3, 4 and 5, respectively, from Masago and 21, 14, one, nine and three isolates were related to the genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 4, respectively, from donors. No clinical or virological factor was associated with TTV viremia or TTV genotypes. Conclusions: TT Virus prevalence was higher among HCV hyperendemic township residents than blood donors with similar genotype distributions (genotype 1 was the most prevalent) in Taiwan. Neither TTV viremia nor a particular genotype was associated with HBV, HCV or GBV-C/HGV infection and abnormal ALT levels. © 2002 Blackwell Publishing Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Objective. To assess the possible sexual transmission of virus and to identify the prevalence of TTV viremia in Turkey and its association with other hepatotropic viruses. Methods. Serum samples were collected from 81 subjects (74 prostitutes and seven homosexual men) at high risk of sexually transmitted infection and from 81 healthy controls (74 females and seven males). Sera of patients and controls were tested for TTV, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. Also, serum alanine and aspartate aminotransferases were measured. Results. The prevalence rates of TTV viremia in the risk group and control group were 86.4% and 82.7%, respectively. There was a statistical difference in mean age between TTV-infected and uninfected subjects (38.6 ± 9.9 versus 32.2 ± 6.1 years, respectively, P < 0.001). Prevalence rates of TTV infection in subjects with positive anti-HAV and positive anti-HBc were high when compared with subjects who were negative for these. Conclusion. We suggest that TTV infection has a diverse route of transmission, and its prevalence increases with age; also, the prevalence rate of TTV is high in certain risk groups. The prevalence rates of TTV in the group at risk for sexual transmission (86.4%) and in the control group (82.7%) were among the highest ever reported in the world. Also, we suggest that TTV generally does not cause clinical disease, in spite of this high prevalence.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Recently many publications have appeared about the new DNA virus, called transfusion transmitted virus (TT virus), first described in 1997. These are mainly about the virus epidemiology, gene sequences and the distribution of different genotypes. In spite of the fact that the prevalence of this type of infection can reach 40 percent rate in polytransfused patients, such as in hemodialysis patients, the real pathogenetic effect of the virus has not yet been known. AIMS: The aim of the authors was to examine the activation and distribution of mononuclear cells in peripheral blood and to analyse the possible changes in Th1/Th2 immune regulatory mechanism through the soluble and intracellular cytokine profile beside the biochemical parameters of hepatic lesions in TT virus positive (n = 32) and negative (n = 17) hemodialysed patients. Healthy blood donors were the control group (n = 20). METHOD: Semi-nested PCR was used to detect the DNA of TT virus. For the surface antigen (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD56, CD3/HLA-DR, CD3/CD69) and intracellular cytokine analysis the authors applied flow cytometric method. RESULTS: The authors did not find any differences in the liver specific biochemical parameters between TT virus positive and negative hemodialysed and the healthy control group. The number of total T, T helper and total B cells were decreased. The percentage of CD8+, CD3+/HLA-DR+, CD3+/CD69+ and CD56+ cells were increased significantly in both hemodialysed population independently the presence or absence of TT virus. The soluble and intracellular cytokines showed significant growth of the Th1/Th2 cells ratio in hemodialysed patients, which has not been modified by the virus. CONCLUSIONS: From these results the authors assume that the TT virus does not cause any significant changes in the immune regulation, although it could play some role in the pathogenesis of hepatitis by local reaction.

AB  - In the past 10 years, hepatitis C and G viruses have been identified, and in the last two years a further parenterally transmitted agent, termed TT virus (TTV), has been discovered. These viruses have a worldwide distribution and frequently cause chronic infection. The purpose of this article was to promote an understanding of these viral agents and their relevance in dental practice. Infected patients may develop a chronic carrier state without clinical disease or may develop liver disease, and may have related oral conditions. Dental providers will see a growing number of patients with HCV/HGV and possibly TTV infection. All of these patients require appropriate infection control measures during dental treatment.

AB  - Recent discovery of a novel DNA virus from the serum of a Japanese patient (T.T.) has prompted further studies directed on possible role of TT virus in the development of cryptogenic hepatitis. The TT is an unenveloped and circular DNA virus. TTV possesses single stranded DNA genome and comprises 3537 to 3853 nucleotides. TTV is similar to the Circoviridae and possesses three open reading frames. Phylogenetic analysis revealed up to 30% nucleotide sequence divergence in the 16 virus genotypes. TTV infection can be detected by polymerase chain reactions, in situ hybridization and by specific antibodies to TTV. TTV DNA has been identified in the serum of patients with cryptogenic hepatitis, hepatitis B and C, hepatocellular carcinoma as well as in healthy individuals. TTV has been found also in the peripheral blood leukocytes, bone marrow cells, liver biopsies as well as in feces and breast milk. Some animals including cattle, sheep, pigs and chicken appeared to have TTV viremia. Recent detection of TTV in nonblood products, such as saliva and feces suggest in addition to parenteral also nonparenteral routes of TTV transmissions including sexual and fecal-oral.

AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection was investigated by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) in low- (blood donors and healthy children/adolescents) and high-risk (hemophiliacs) groups from São Paulo, Brazil. Primers based on the untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome proved to be much more ubiquitous, leading to much higher frequencies for both groups (≥ 81%) than the earlier N22-PCR directed to the open reading frame 1 (blood donors, 5.5%, and hemophiliacs, 42.3%). The UTR-PCR also revealed an interesting profile for healthy children/adolescents: very high prevalence at the early years and significant decrease in male teenagers. The N22-PCR, in turn, demonstrated higher frequency in hemophiliacs treated with fresh blood products (58%), than in those treated with virus-inactivated clotting factors (9.4%) and blood donors (5.5%).

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is an unenveloped, single-stranded, circular-DNA virus which resembles members of the Circoviridae, that is commonly found in humans and which lacks pathological consequences for the infected host. TTV replication has been demonstrated in bone marrow cells but not in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), suggesting that hematopoietic cells must be activated to support TTV replication. To test this hypothesis, PBMC from two naturally TTV-infected individuals and from two healthy TTV-DNA negative donors infected in vitro with a TTV-DNA-positive serum were cultured in the presence (stimulated) or absence (unstimulated) of phytohemagglutinin, lipopolysaccharide, and interleukin-2. TTV-DNA was detected in both stimulated and unstimulated PBMC. However, TTV-DNA replicative intermediates and mRNA were detected only in stimulated PBMC. Furthermore, TTV-DNA and mRNA were detected in PBMC from two TTV negative donors reinfected with supernatants from TTV-infected stimulated cells but not when using culture supernatants from unstimulated cells. These results demonstrate that TTV replicates in PBMC only when stimulated. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

AB  - After the discovery of hepatitis A, B, C, D and E viruses, several lines of evidence suggested that an additional hepatitis agent (s) might exist. Molecular approaches led sequentially to the discoveries of GBV-C/HGV, TTV and more recently SENV. At issue is whether these agents cause non - A non - E hepatitis and/or some extrahepatic diseases. These problems are discussed in present paper, considering the newest data from literature.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified human DNA virus of the family Circoviridae. Its genome consists of six putative open reading frames (ORFs). TTV was isolated originally from a patient with cryptogenic hepatitis and the association of TTV with hepatitis has been studied extensively, while its significance in other diseases is unknown. To examine the pathogenicity of TTV, mice transgenic for the ORF genes in various combinations were produced. A total of 11 independent founder mice was produced: two mice, which were found to carry the ORF1 gene, showed pathological changes in the kidney; other tissues were not affected. In these mice, the transgene was expressed most strongly in the kidney and the transcript was shown to be spliced to encode a protamine-like, highly basic protein. Mice from a line with high transgene expression developed renal failure with severe renal epithelial cell abnormalities resembling those seen in humans with nephrotic syndrome. The transgenic mice with severe ascites died before reaching the age of 5 weeks. Another founder mouse with low expression levels also showed similar, but milder, renal epithelial cell changes, indicating that these effects were not caused by the insertion of the transgene, but, rather, were caused by the ORF1 gene product. These observations suggest that TTV affects renal epithelial cells as part of the naturally occurring infection.

AB  - Using PCR with primers derived from a non-coding region of the human TT virus (TTV) genome, the TTV sequence in serum samples obtained from pigs (Sus domesticus), dogs (Canis familiaris) and cats (Felis catus) was identified and the entire genomic sequence was determined for each representative isolate. Three TTV isolates (Sd-TTV31 from a pig, Cf-TTV10 from a dog and Fc-TTV4 from a cat) comprising 2878, 2797 and 2064 nucleotides, respectively, each had three open reading frames (ORFs) encoding 436-635 (ORF1), 73-105 (ORF2) and 224-243 (ORF3) aa but lacked ORF4, similar to tupaia TTV. ORF3 was presumed to arise from a splicing of TTV mRNA, similar to human prototype TTV. Although the nucleotide sequence of Sd-TTV31, Cf-TTV10 and Fc-TTV4 differed by more than 50% from each other and from previously reported TTVs of 3.4-3.9 kb and TTV-like mini viruses (TLMVs) of 2.8-3.0 kb isolated from humans and non-human primates as well as tupaia TTVs of 2.2 kb, they resembled known TTVs and TLMVs with regard to genomic organization and presumed transcriptional profile rather than animal circoviruses of 1.7-2.3 kb. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Sd-TTV31, Cf-TTV10 and Fc-TTV4 were closer to TTVs from lower-order primates and tupaias than to TTVs from higher-order primates and TLMVs. These results indicate that domestic pigs, cats and dogs are naturally infected with species-specific TTVs with small genomic size and suggest a wide distribution of TTVs with extremely divergent genomic sequence and length in animals.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV), a member of a family of human viruses related to the circoviridae viruses, was associated initially with acute and chronic liver diseases. TTV consists of a single-stranded, circular DNA genome of 3.8 kilobases (kb) and at least three open reading frames (ORFs). The objective of the present study was to determine whether or not TTV replicated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow cells (BMCs). DNA was extracted from the PBMCs or BMCs of 153 cancer patients and from the PBMCs of 50 healthy blood donors (the controls). By using a single round of polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TTV was detected in 98.6% (141 of 143) of the PBMCs and in 90% (9 of 10) of the BMCs from cancer patients. TTV DNA was detected in significantly fewer control subjects at 86% (43 of 50; P < 0.05). Strand-specific PCR (SSPCR) targeting the ORF2 of the common genotypes of TTV was developed specifically to detect TTV positive or negative strand DNA and to examine TTV replication. TTV positive strand DNA, which may be an intermediate of viral replication, was detected in 55.3% (78 of 141) of the TTV-infected PBMCs of the cancer patients and in 7% (3 of 43) of the controls (P < 0.001). The replicative form of TTV was also detectable in 55.6% (5 of 9) of the TTV-infected BMCs. The existence of double-strand (positive and negative strands) TTV DNA in PBMCs and BMCs of the cancer patients was also supported by the finding that TTV DNA extracted from these cells was resistant to S1 nuclease. Using in situ hybridization, TTV DNA was also demonstrated to be present in the nucleus of PBMCs. It is concluded that replicative intermediate forms of TTV DNA are present in both PBMCs and BMCs, indicating that blood cells may be a site of TTV replication. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - To investigate responses of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TT virus (TTV) to high dose and long duration interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) therapy (540 million units in 36 weeks) and factors associated with the viral clearance, sera of 165 Taiwanese naïve chronic hepatitis C patients were tested for alanine aminotransferase, HCV RNA levels, HCV genotypes and TTV DNA. With 41.8% of TTV DNA prevalence, TTV viremia was significantly associated with history of blood transfusion (P < 0.01). After IFN therapy, HCV complete response was achieved in 60 (36.4%) patients and significantly associated with lower pretreatment levels of HCV RNA (P < 0.01) and HCV genotype non-1b (P < 0.05). Fifty-three patients with concurrent TTV infection were evaluated for TTV response. TTV sustained clearance was achieved in 24 (48%) patients and significantly associated with loss of TTV DNA at the end point of treatment. In conclusion, concurrent TTV infection is highly prevalent, related to blood transfusion and independent of HCV infection. After high dose and long duration IFN-alpha therapy, HCV and TTV clearance are achieved among more than one-third and around one-half patients. HCV RNA levels and HCV genotypes are predictors for HCV response and no clinical factors are observed to be associated with TTV clearance. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The possible causative role of novel TT virus in liver diseases has been intensively studied in regarding its hepatotrophy, ability to cause persistent infection and worldwide prevalence. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence as well as the clinical importance of TTV in a normal healthy population group in the Czech Republic and in a group of liver transplant recipients diagnosed with cryptogenic cirrhosis. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected the DNA of TT virus in 68% (13/19) of samples isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes and in 21% (4/19) of plasma samples in the liver transplant group. The viral DNA was detected only in 11.8% (4/34) of leukocytes and in no plasma sample from the healthy population control group. All patients included in this study had good liver function and had no complications during the postoperative period. The prevalence of TTV DNA detection in healthy control group in Czech republic is similar to the rates reported in European and North American countries. Significant difference was proved between the prevalences of TTV in the groups of healthy controls and liver transplant recipients with cryptogenic cirrhosis. However, no association of TTV infection with possible postoperative complications could be found.

AB  - Aim: TT virus (TTV) is a single stranded DNA virus found in serum of patients with post-transfusion non-A to -G hepatitis. TTV-DNA has been investigated in sera of patients with various liver diseases. This study aimed at finding whether co-infection with TTV in HCV patients, may influence the effect of interferon (IFN) in complete elimination of HCV, and analysed the correlation between HCV and TTV by semi-quantification of both HCV RNAs and TTV DNA. Methods: In 28 chronic hepatitis C(CH-C) patients with TTV co-infection, the presence of TTV DNA was checked in sera six months before and after the end of IFN therapy. Result: Five out of 28 patients became negative for both HCV-RNA and TTV-DNA following IFN therapy. But 10 out of 28 patients persistently remained positive for both. Among the remaining 13 patients, 5 tested negative for HCV-RNA but positive for TTV-DNA. Post IFN therapy changes in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels did not appear to be influenced by the presence of TTV co-infection. HCV-RNA was found to be the most important predictor of IFN response in CH-C patients with TTV co-infection. TTV DNA level in sera had no correlation with IFN response. In addition, there was no relationship between HCV RNA and TTV DNA. Conclusion: Based on these results, it can be concluded that the effectiveness of IFN in eliminating HCV does not seem to be influenced by co-infection.

AB  - Discovery of TT virus in 1997 gave raise to intensive subsequent studies to learn about its structure, features and, what is the most important, about its role in pathogenesis of liver disease. The aim of the work was to analyze prevalence of TTV DNA in patients with diagnosed hepatitis B, C, that of unknown etiology and in healthy blood donors as well. Additionally the divergence of TTV sequence was estimated in selected cases. TTV DNA was detected by PCR technique using specific oligonucleotide primers for coding regions. TT virus has been detected in 25.6% (32/125) HBsAg positive patients and in 23.9% (51/213) HCV infected patients. In healthy blood donors the frequency of TTV was 24.3% (34/140) similarly to that found in HCV and HBV infected patients. The frequency of TTV DNA among patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology was 9.1%. This result was statistically significant lower than in the other groups. When detected sequences have been compared to these from NCBI base the homology result was 71% to 95%, and among different patients and groups of patients identity was 46% to 73%. On the basis of the obtained results it can be concluded that it is very unlikely that TTV coinfection plays any significant role in HCV or HBV infection. The hypothetical role of TTV infection in the etiopathogenesis of cryptogenic chronic hepatitis has not been confirmed. The results obtained in the small group of patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology are not conclusive and should be taken with some precaution. The final conclusion is the TTV coinfection does not contribute to the liver pathology. The divergence of TTV sequences may explain the various frequency of TTV viremia reported by other authors.

AB  - In order to determine whether peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) contain proviral DNA or double-stranded replicative forms of TT virus (TTV) and to define which cell subset harbors TTV, we analyzed 126 PBMC DNA samples by PCR, using the NG059/NG061/NG063 and the T801/T935 primer sets. TTV sequences were detected in nearly 20%(25/126) of PBMC DNA samples. Analysis of PBMC subsets revealed that TTV was preferentially distributed in CD19+ cells. TTV DNA was also detected in CD3+/CD19+ double-depleted cells but was undetectable in CD3+ cells. After degradation of single-stranded DNA using mung bean nuclease (MBN), TTV could not be detected in previously TTV-positive PBMC DNA samples nor in DNA from CD19+ cells, CD3+-depleted, and CD3+/CD19+ double-depleted cells, indicating the lack of TTV DNA integration and the absence of viral double-stranded replicative intermediates in PBMC or PBMC subset cells. Our data indicate that PBMC and PBMC subsets are not the major sites of TTV replication. © Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The near-full-length genome of a TT virus (TTV) (HEL32), closely related to the previously uncharacterized genotype 6, was cloned and sequenced. The genomic organization of HEL32 was compared to 41 published near-full-length TTV sequences representing 17 genotypes. In the majority of genomes, the open reading frame (ORF) 2 region was divided into two separate ORFs, 2a and 2b. The ORF2a sequence was conserved among all genotypes, while the ORF2b region showed more variability. The two corresponding putative proteins of HEL32 were expressed in prokaryotes and their antigenic potential was studied. IgM and IgG antibodies to the respective ORF2-encoded proteins, fp2a and fp2b, and the presence of TTV DNA were studied in the sera of 89 constitutionally healthy adults. By immunoblot using the small TTV proteins as antigens, strong IgM and IgG reactivities were found in 9 and 10% of subjects, respectively. Follow-up studies for 12-15 years of three subjects showed either a persistent coexistence of IgM and TTV DNA or the appearance of viral DNA regardless of pre-existing antibodies. The low prevalence of IgG could be due to the weak immunogenicity of these probably non-structural proteins or to a genotype-specific antibody response. By nested PCR of the conserved ORF2a region, the prevalence of TTV DNA was 85%. TTV genotype 6 sequences were found by specific PCR in 3 of 35 (8.6%) subjects. The low prevalence of TTV IgG compared to the high TTV DNA prevalence, the coexistence of antibodies and viral DNA and the appearance of TTV DNA regardless of pre-existing antibodies suggest that the B-cell immunity against these minor TTV proteins would not be cross protective.

AB  - Although results of IFN alpha therapy in chronic hepatitis C (C-CH) patients co-infected with TT virus (TTV) have been reported, no results of IFN beta therapy or IFN beta and alpha combination therapy have been reported. In this study, we retrospectively investigated whether co-infection with TTV affects the results of IFN therapy by using stored sera from 60 C-CH patients co-infected with TTV who underwent IFN beta therapy or IFN beta and alpha combination therapy. The stored sera were from 29 complete responders, 10 incomplete responders, and 21 non-responders, and they were used for qualitative and quantitative analysis of HCV RNA, HCV genotype analysis, and qualitative and quantitative analyses of TTV DNA. TTV DNA was detected in 23 (38.3%) of the 60 C-CH sera. The TTV DNA-positive rate was 17.2% among the complete responders to IFN therapy, versus 58.1% in the incomplete responders and non-responders, and the difference was significant (p < 0.01). While the complete response prediction rate based on two factors, HCV RNA level and HCV genotype, was 80.8% (21/26) in the C-CH patients, the prediction rate based on three factors, these two factors plus TTV DNA, was higher, 90.0% (18/20). It was concluded that determination of HCV RNA concentration, HCV genotype, and TTV DNA, before IFN beta therapy or IFN beta and alpha combination therapy is useful for predicting the results of treatment of C-CH patients.

AB  - When TT virus (TTV) DNA was quantitated in whole blood and plasma aliquots from 27 viremic individuals by real-time detection PCR that can detect essentially all TTV genotypes, the TTV load was 6.9 ± 3.5 (mean ± standard deviation)-fold higher in the whole blood than in the plasma samples [P &lt; 0.002 (paired t test)]. To clarify the reason for this difference, peripheral blood cells of various types including red blood cells, granulocytes (CD15+), B cells (CD19+), T cells (CD3+), monocytes (CD14+), and NK cells (CD3-/CD56+) were separated at a purity of 95.4-99.5% from each of three infected individuals with relatively high TTV viremia, and their TTV viral loads were determined. Red blood cells were uniformly negative, but the other cell types were positive for TTV DNA at various titers. In all three patients, the highest TTV load was found in granulocytes (4.2 × 104-3.1 ± 105 copies/106 cells), followed by monocytes (1.4-2.2 × 104 copies/106 cells) and NK cells (5.4-6.5 × 103 copies/106 cells); B and T cells were positive, with a low viral load (6.7 × 101-2.7 × 103 copies/106 cells). These results indicate that TTV is distributed in various peripheral blood cell types at distinct levels, with the highest viral load in granulocytes, and that a significant proportion of the TTV DNA in peripheral blood is not identified by the standard plasma/serum DNA detection methods. © 2002 Elsevier Science.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV) is widespread in the general population, however, the mode of its transmission and the mechanism of maintaining it in the general population are unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: To determine the possible mother-to-infant route of transmission, 54 infants bom to 50 anti-HCV-positive mothers were assessed longitudinally. Nucleotide sequences amplified by seminested PCR with primers targeting the N22 variable coding region of genotypes 1 through 6 were compared in mothers and their infants. RESULTS: The prevalence of TTV DNA was 30 percent (15/50; 95% CI, 18-45) in mothers and 44 percent (24/54; 95% CI, 31-59) in their infants. TTV DNA was detected during a follow-up period in 13 (87%; 95% CI, 60-98) of 15 infants born to infected mothers and in 11 (28%; 95% CI, 15-45) of 39 infants bom to DNA-negative mothers. None of 38 cord blood samples, but one of 14 blood samples, obtained at 1 month of age had detectable TTV DNA. The lowest infection rate at the earliest ages and the subsequent increasing prevalence of infection (22% at 6 months and 33% [43% cumulative rate] at 2 years) is consistent with an age-dependent acquisition of TTV by nonparenteral routes. In 13-mother-infant pairs positive for TTV DNA, six showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence similarity (99.1-100%), whereas the remaining seven pairs differed more than 10 percent from each other (46.8-89.2%). The viral load of matemal blood was not a plausible risk factor for transmission. Genotype 1, of which pathogenicity failed to be shown by measurement of hepatic enzymes, was more rapidly cleared (88 vs. 8% other genotypes, p < 0.001) among infants. CONCLUSIONS: These observations strongly suggest that the main factor for TTV acquisition in children involves their age-associated increase in environmental interactions with infectious materials. Genotype 1 might be involved in a weak or a limited pathologic role, which can possibly be diluted by other harmless genotypes.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the serum positive percentage of TT virus (TTV) in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C and the response of the coinfected TTV to interferon (IFN) during IFN therapy for chronic hepatitis B and C. Methods: We retrospectively studied the serum samples of 70 patients with chronic hepatitis who had received IFN-alfa therapy from January 1997 to June 2000, which included 40 cases of hepatitis B and 30 hepatitis C. All the patients had been followed up for at least 6 months after the end of IFN therapy. The serum TTV DNA was detected using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before and every month during the course of IFN treatment. Results: TTV infection was detected in 15 % (6/40) of the chronic hepatitis B group and 30 % (9/30) of the chronic hepatitis C group. Loss of serum TTV DNA during IFN therapy occurred in 3 of 6 patients (50 %) and 6 of 9 (67 %) of hepatitis B and C groups, respectively. Seronegativity of TTV was found all during the first month of IFN therapy in the 9 patients. There was no correlation between the seroconversion of TTV and the biochemical changes of the patients. Conclusion: TTV is not infrequently coinfected in patients with chronic hepatitis B and C in Taiwan, and more than half of the TTV infections are IFN-sensitive. However, the loss of serum TTV DNA does not affect the clinical course of the patients with chronic hepatitis B or C.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clone the DNA of a TT virus (TTV) variant isolated from a patient with elevated alanine transaminase (ALT) of unknown etiology, and conduct sequence analysis. METHODS: The long fragment of TTV DNA was amplified by nested PCR and then cloned into pGEM-T vector. A clone named 56-B containing 3.2 kb TTV DNA was selected for sequence analysis besides homology analysis with other 5 TTV variants retrieved from GenBank, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out by maximum likelihood method. RESULTS: The nucleotide identities of 56-B with the other 5 TTV strains TA278, JA10, US35, SANBAN and TUS01 were 42.4%, 48.2%, 47.9%, 49.8 % and 61.7 % respectively, and the corresponding amino acid identities were even lower. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 56-B was far from other TTV strains in genetic distance that ranged from 0.344 to 0.458. However, the sequences in the 5'- and 3'-end were still much conservative. CONCLUSION: The isolated 56-B showed high heterogeneity in genetic background and was therefore quite distinct from other TTV strains as a novel TTV variant that represents a new TTV genotype.

AB  - Purpose of the review: The list of possible hepatotropic viruses continues to grow with the discovery of the GB virus-C, the TT virus and the SEN virus. There is emerging data on the biology of these newly discovered viruses and their role in the pathogenesis of both acute and chronic liver diseases. Recent findings: In spite of continuing research into the pathogenicity of the GB virus-C and the TT virus, definite evidence linking them to acute or chronic liver disease is lacking. The SEN virus was reported in 2000, and although there seems to be an association between virus and transfusion-related hepatitis, more data are awaited before definite conclusions can be drawn. The effect of GB virus-C, the TT virus and the SEN virus co-infection on other viral and non-viral hepatitides has also been studied in some detail. Again, there is no definite evidence so far that these viruses modify other liver diseases. Summary: At the present time, diagnostic testing for these viruses does not seem to be warranted outside of clinical studies. The discovery of these viruses, however, paves the way for further research into novel viral agents that infect humans, other among hosts.

METHODS: The antibody to TTV in sera collected from different population were detected by using ELISA and the different ORF genes were amplified with PCR. RESULTS: The positive rates of TTV ORF1 DNA, ORF2 DNA and the antibody in various populations were as follows: 16.0% (12/75), 10.7% (8/75) and 25.3% (19/75) in paid blood donors; 10.0 (3/30), 16.7% (5/30) and 16.7% (5/30) in patients with hepatitis A, 47.5% (19/40), 42.5% (17/40) and 22.5% (9/40) in patients with hepatitis B; 42.9% (15/35), 37.1% (13/35) and 28.6% (10/35) in patients with hepatitis C; 20.0% (3/15), 26.7% (4/15) and 13.3% (2/15)in patients with hepatitis D; 16.7% (2/12),16.7% (2/12) and 33.3% (4/12)in patients with hepatitis E; 23.8% (5/21), 38.1% (8/21) and 23.8% (5/21) in patients with hepatitis G; 61.1% (11/18), 50.0% (9/18) and 44.4% (8/18) in patients with non A-G hepatitis, respectively. The positive rate of different ORF DNA had no significant difference. Significant differences were found in the positive rates of TTV DNA in various populations. There was no relationship between the TTV DNA and the antibody to TTV. CONCLUSIONS: The antibody to TTV and TTV DNA were found in every population of China. There was no significant difference in the positive rates of TTV DNA between ORF1 and ORF2. The positive rate in patients with non A-G hepatitis was higher than those in the other populations.

AB  - Primarily TTV has been thought as an etiologic agent of post transfusion non-A to -G hepatitis. TTV can replicate in liver and bone marrow cells. The presence of TTV has been found in the serum of patients with acute as well as chronic hepatitis of known etiology. Patients with acute hepatitis A, B, C and hepatitis caused by EBV or CMV all have TTV viremia in a frequency up to 60%. In chronic viral hepatitis TTV was present in a wide range of 7-94.4%. Treatment of viral hepatitis patients with interferon alfa and rybawiryn leads to eradication of TTV viremia in 50% cases. TTV infection in hepatocellular carcinoma ranged from 8.1% up to 100% patients. In hepatitis of unknown etiology TTV infection was observed in 26% to 71% cases. In liver cirrhosis TTV infection has been evidenced in 10% to 66% patients. Some authors postulated that the frequency of TTV increased with the number of blood or blood products transfusions. Coinfection of TTV has been found in 34.9%-76% of HIV positive persons. The study of medical staff revealed no difference in TTV viremia with healthy individual control. TTV is widespread in healthy general population. Therefore based on so far published results the association between TTV infection and hepatitis is questionable.

AB  - Background: Viral hepatitis with various forms of acute and chronic liver disease as potential and ultimately fatal sequelae presents a public health problem worldwide. Methods: Recent published reports on the global epidemiology and prophylaxis of viral hepatitis were reviewed. Results: With the advances in novel technologies, eight distinct types of hepatitis virus have been described: Hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G, TT and SEN viruses. Hepatitis A and E viruses are transmitted by the fecal-oral route and do not induce a chronic carrier state. Due to major changes in epidemiology of hepatitis A virus their significance is more pronounced in areas of intermediate endemicity. Since the available hepatitis A vaccine is rather expensive, cost-benefit studies should be performed with emphasis on the area under consideration or specialized vulnerable groups. Parenterally transmitted hepatitis B and C viruses are major causes of chronic liver disease, including cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and end-stage liver failure. Hepatitis D virus is unable to replicate on its own, it requires an established hepatitis B virus infection to be able to replicate. Since its introduction, hepatitis B vaccine has been widely used leading to a significant decrease in HBV infection in countries with universal vaccination. Hepatitis G and TT viruses have been characterized within the latter part of the past decade but their significance as to the causation of human liver disease has yet to be elucidated. Likewise, the precise impact of the most recently described SEN virus isolated from patients with post-transfusion hepatitis awaits further studies. Conclusions: In the course of this review, we present the situation and focus on research activities emphasizing epidemiology and prevention of the various forms of viral hepatitis. © 2002 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

Significant difficulty in extracting nucleic acids from mummified tissues has been reported due to chemical modification and degradation. The goal of this study was to determine a method that is more efficient for DNA and RNA extraction from mummified tissues. Twelve mummy specimens were analyzed with 9 different nucleic acid extraction methods, including guanidium thiocyanate (GTC) and proteinase K/detergent based methods prepared in our laboratory or purchased. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase DNA and β-actin RNA were used as markers for the presence of adequate DNA and RNA, respectively, for PCR and RT-PCR amplification. Our results show that 5 M GTC is more efficient of releasing nucleic acids from mummified tissue than proteinase K/detergent, and phenol/chloroform extraction with an additional chloroform step is more efficient than phenol/chloroform along. We were able to isolate DNAs from all 12 specimens and RNAs from 8 of 12 specimens, and the nucleic acids were sufficient for PCR and RT-PCR analysis. We further tested hepatitis viruses including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis G virus, and TT virus DNA, and fail to detect these viruses in all 12 specimens. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - There is considerable interest in the possible clinical effects of the human circoviruses TT virus (TTV) and TTV-like mini virus (TLMV). Most people appear to have at least one of these viruses replicating actively in their bodies, thus mere correlation of the presence of virus and disease states are probably less informative than a quantitative analysis of viraemia. Real-time PCR based methods, with either SYBR Green or TaqMan probe, designed to quantitate selectively TTV and TLMV are described. The suggested TaqMan-based protocols were suitable for quantitation of viruses in the range of 102-109 copies/ml of sample; and proved, by sequencing of PCR products, to be specific for each of the two viruses. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - The sera pool of the human blood containing TTV DNA were administered to mice intravenously and then every 10 days examinations were made of blood serum and different organs of inoculated mice by polymerase chain reaction for presence of the viral nucleotide sequences. The viral DNA was revealed in the blood serum, the liver, kidneys and other organs 20 days after infection and persisted in most of the animals during 80 days. The data obtained show the possibility of TTV-infection of mice.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the state of infection, replication site, pathogenicity and clinical significance of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in patients with hepatitis, especially in patients of unknown etiology. Methods: Liver tissues taken from 136 cases of non-A non-G hepatitis were tested for TT virus antigen and nucleic acid by in situ hybridization (ISH) and nested-polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Among them, TT virus genome and its complemental strand were also detected in 24 cases of autopsy liver and extrahepatic tissues with ISH. Meanwhile, TTV DNA was detected in the sera of 187 hepatitis patients by nested-PCR. The pathological and clinical data of the cases infected with TTV only were analyzed. Results: In liver, the total positive rate of TTV DNA was 32.4% and the positive signals were located in the nuclei of hepatocytes. In serus, TTV DNA was detected in 21.4% cases of hepatitis A-G, 34.4% of non-A non-G hepatitis and 15% of healthy donors. The correspondence rate of TTV DNA detection between liver tissue with ISH and sera with PCR was 63.2% and 89.3% in the same liver tissues by ISH and by PCR, respectively. Using double-strand probes and single-strand probes designed to detect TTV genome, the correspondence rate of TTV DNA detected in liver and extrahepatic tissues was 85.7%. Using single-strand probes, TTV genome could be detected in liver and extrahepatic tissues by PCR, but its complemental strands (replication strands) could be observed only in livers. The liver function of most cases infected with TTV alone was abnormal and the liver tissues had different pathological damage such as ballooning, acidophilia degeneration, formation of apoptosis bodies and focus of necrosis, but the inflammation in the lobule and portal area was mild. Conclusion: The positive rate of TTV DNA among cases of hepatitis was higher than that of donors, especially in patients with non-A non-G hepatitis, but most of them were coinfected with other hepatitis viruses. TTV can infect not only hepatocytes but also extrahepatic tissues. However, the chief replication place may be liver. The infection of TTV may have some pathogenicity. Although the pathogenicity is comparatively weak, it can still damage the liver tissues. The lesions in acute hepatitis (AH) and chronic hepatitis (CH) are mild, but in severe hepatitis (SH), it can be very serious and cause liver function failure, therefore, we should pay more attention to TTV when studying the possible pathogens of so-called "liver hepatitis of unknown etiology".

AB  - Purpose: To investigate whether TT virus (TTV) viral load may be used as a surrogate marker for functional immune reconstitution in HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Method: Fifteen protease inhibitor-naïve HIV-infected patients were included in a longitudinal study. From each patient, three serum samples taken before HAART initiation and three samples taken during HAART were analyzed. TTV was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was quantitated by competitive PCR. TTV viral heterogeneity was determined by restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) and sequencing. Results: All 15 HIV-infected patients were TTV positive. No significant change in HIV RNA or TTV viral load was observed at the three time points before HAART initiation. Even though HAART lead to an immediate and significant reduction in HIV RNA (p = .0001), a significant reduction in TTV viral load (p = .0002) was not observed until after 3-5 months of HAART. Four patients did not have an increase in CD4+ T cell count after 1 year of HAART; however, a decrease in TTV viral load was still observed, and three of these patients had a reduction in HIV RNA. RFLPs and sequencing revealed that TTV is represented as a heterogeneous population of virus in HIV-infected patients. Conclusion: This pilot study suggests that HAART leads to improved immunological responses, even in patients who do not have an increase in CD4+ T cell counts. We propose that the change in TTV viral load may be useful in the evaluation of cellular immune response at a functional level in HIV-infected patients who receive HAART.

AB  - Aim: To determine the frequencies of HGV and TTV infections in serum and saliva samples of non-hepatitis patients with oral diseases in Hangzhou area, and to understand the correlation between detected results of HGV RNA and/or TTV DNA in sera and in saliva from the same patients. Methods: RT-nested PCR for HGV RNA detection and semi-nested PCR for TTV DNA detection were performed in the serum and saliva samples from 226 non-hepatitis patients with oral diseases, and nucleotide sequence analysis. Results: Twenty-seven (11.9 %) and 21 (9.3 %) of the 226 serum samples were only positive for HGV RNA and TTV DNA, respectively. 10 (4.4 %) and 9 (3.9 %) of the 226 saliva samples were only positive for HGV RNA and TTV DNA, respectively. And 7 (3.1 %) of the serum samples and 2 (0.9 %) of the saliva samples showed the positive amplification results for both HGV RNA and TTV DNA. 12 saliva samples from the 34 patients (35.3 %) with HGV or HGV/TTV viremia and 11 saliva samples from the 28 patients (39.3 %) with TTV or HGV/TTV viremia were HGV RNA detectable, respectively, including two patients positive for both HGV RNA and TTV DNA in serum and saliva samples. No saliva samples from the 226 patients were found to be HGV RNA or TTV DNA detectable while their serum samples were negative for HGV or TTV. Homologies of the nucleotide sequences of HGV and TTV amplification products from the serum and saliva samples of the two patients compared with the reported sequences were 88.65-91.49 % and 65.32-66.67 %, respectively. In comparison with the nucleotide sequences of amplification products between serum and from saliva sample from any one of the two patients, the homologies were 98.58 % and 99.29 % for HGV, and were 98.65 % and 98.20 % for TTV, respectively. Conclusion: Relatively high carrying rates of HGV and/or TTV in the sera of non-hepatitis patients with oral diseases in Hangzhou area are demonstrated. Parts of the carriers are HGV and/or TTV positive in their saliva. The results of this study indicate that dentists may be one of the populations with high risk for HGV and/or TTV infection, and by way of saliva HGV and TTV may be transmitted among individuals.

AB  - Background: The recently discovered TT virus (TTV) has been shown to be highly prevalent in patients with cryptogenetic chronic liver disease and fulminant hepatitis. To study the frequency of TTV and to evaluate the possible association with liver disease, 37 pediatric and young adult patients with thalassemia, and 36 healthy children were included in the study. The sera of 100 blood donors selected randomly in the same period were also tested for TTV DNA. Methods: The TTV amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed using a first set of primers that recognize an internal sequence into N22 and a second set of primers amplifying a sequence within 5′NCR (5′ noncoding region). Results: The first set of primers revealed TTV DNA in 73% of thalassemic patients, in 8% of healthy children, and in 5% of healthy blood donors. With the second set of primers, the prevalence of TTV DNA was, respectively, 100% in thalassemic patients, 44.5% in healthy pediatric patients, and 87% in healthy blood donors. All individuals who tested positive for TTV by the first set of primers were also positive by the second primer set. The TTV infection seemed not to be the cause of altered transaminase levels. Sequencing of TTV clones from thalassemic patients showed the presence of different TTV variants in the same serum. Conclusion: The prevalence of TTV in polytransfused children is similar to that detected in blood donors. Moreover, TTV can be detected in healthy children of all ages. The presence of TTV seems to have no clinical significance. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - A novel DNA sequence belonging to a new genotype of TT virus (TTV) was detected by long-distance PCR in the serum of a chronically HCV-infected patient. The isolate was designated KAV according to the patient's initials. Extending the sequence to full length revealed a 3705-nt viral genome, which is about 100 nucleotides shorter than the other TT-viruses. KAV showed common features with the TTV family, such as the organization of open reading frames and conserved noncoding regions. The largest open reading frame of KAV (ORF 1) was about 40 aa shorter than that of other TT-viruses. Overall sequence homology with known TTV isolates was less than 66%. Phylogenetic analysis poses KAV in one major group with three recently published TTV sequences. So KAV can be considered as a new genotype of the TTV family (provisionally designated genotype 28). © 2001 Elsevier Science.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently identified widespread DNA virus of humans that produces persistent viremia in the absence of overt clinical manifestations. In an attempt to shed light on the dynamics of chronic infection, we measured the levels of TTV in the plasma of 25 persistently infected patients during the first 3 months of alpha interferon (IFN-α) treatment for concomitant hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The first significant decline of TTV loads was observed at day 3 versus day 1 for HCV. Subsequently, the loads of TTV became progressively lower in most patients, but some initial responders relapsed before the end of the follow-up, suggesting that at least in some subjects the effects of IFN on TTV can be very short-lived. No correlation between the responses of TTV and HCV to therapy was found. Fitting the viremia data obtained during the first week of treatment into previously developed mathematical models showed that TTV sustains very active chronic infections, with over 90% of the virions in plasma cleared and replenished daily and a minimum of approximately 3.8 × 1010 virions generated per day. Low levels of TTV were occasionally detected in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of patients who had cleared plasma viremia, thus corroborating previous results showing that these cells may support TTV replication and/or persistence.

AB  - Objective. To detect the virus in the feces and sera of patients in an outbreak of enterically transmitted non-A, non-E hepatitis, and this review covers the epidemiologic features and experimental infection of this novel virus. Data sources. Data sources come from our own work on this subject, published and unpublished. Study selection Mainly our own work is included, and related literature is collected. Results. In an outbreak of enterically transmitted non-A-E hepatitis among students, a total of 381 cases (60.7%) were documented. Viral fragments identical to transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) were detected in both serum and stool samples. Asymptomatic virus carriers among the staff had positive serum (32.1%) and feces (24.6%), clearly a potential source of infection. This viral infection prevalence in 2 remote villages in northern and southern China was 9.2% and 10.6%, respectively, suggesting that China is an endemic area. In this study, groups of 3 Rhesus monkeys were infected via oral or intravenous inoculation with patient feces. Two additional monkeys were infected by passage. The virus was detected in serum, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), liver, spleen and small intestine, while the virus positive single strand, which might be a replicative intermediate, was only in liver, intestine and PBMC of all animals. Conclusions. This nonenveloped DNA virus might be transmitted both by blood and enteric routes. Considering its wide distribution and high prevalence, we suppose that nonparenteral transmission is more important.

AB  - In recent years, molecular biology advances have enabled many investigators to discover a number of viruses that have been difficult to characterise by cell culture techniques. Two blood-borne viruses have been identified. These are GB virus C (GBV-C) and TT virus (TTV). GBV-C was discovered in 1995. It is a flavivirus-like enveloped particle measuring 50-100 nm in diameter with a density of 1.08-1.13 g/cm3. The genome of GBV-C is a single-stranded, positive strand ribonucleic acid of approximately 8600 nucleotides. The TTV was discovered in 1997. It is a circular single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid virus, non-enveloped of approximately 3900 nucleotides. It has a density of 1.31-1.34 g/cm3 and a particle size of 30-50 nm. Both viruses are distributed widely throughout the world. Most GBV-C infections are asymptomatic, transient and self-limiting. To date, solid evidence for any association of TTV with disease has not been demonstrated.

AB  - Objective: TT virus (TTV) is frequently detected in the serum and in other body fluids of humans. Recently TTV-specific deoxyribonucleic acid has been detected in cervical specimens from apparently healthy women and in seminal fluid, suggesting that sexual transmission may be common. Study Design/Methods: TT virus-deoxyribonucleic acid prevalence was assessed in paired samples of blood and cervical smears from 110 human immunodeficiency virus-positive women. Detection and typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) present in cervical smears was also performed. Results: The prevalence of TTV-deoxyribonucleic acid in cervical smears was 16.4%, without significant difference (p = 0.81) between HPV-positive (18.6%) and -negative (14.9%) samples. The distribution of high/middle and low-risk HPV types was similar in TTV-positive and -negative samples. On the contrary, women with multiple HPV infections had a significantly higher TTV-deoxylibonucleic acid prevalence (60.0%) than HPV-negative women (p = 0.04). Conclusions: TT virus excretion in the female genital tract of human immunodeficiency virus-infected women is common, further supporting sexual transmission of this virus. © Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Previous reports documented the recovery of a DNA virus from a patient with posttransfusion non-A-G hepatitis and named TT virus (TTV). Although the virus was initially detected as a causative agent of hepatitis, there is doubt about its pathogenicity. The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between TTV and liver diseases. Histopathological examination of liver biopsies from 14 patients with TTV genotype 1 positive non-B, non-C and non-G chronic hepatitis showed mild fibrosis and periportal/piecemeal necrosis. Using the real-time detection (RTD)-PCR method, we found that TTV DNA levels of genotype 1 in liver samples from 3 such patients were 100- to 1,000-fold higher than those in the paired serum samples. Further investigation using various tissues from 2 autopsies of patients with hepatitis C with hepatocellular carcinoma revealed that the concentrations of TTV DNA in the liver were also higher than in serum samples. However, the highest TTV DNA concentrations in these 2 autopsies were found in the lung and bone marrow, respectively. Our results suggest that TTV may replicate in various tissues including the liver and may cause only mild liver damage. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - We present three cases of infants with idiopathic neonatal hepatitis showing diffuse intrahepatic fatty degeneration. Prolonged cholestasis has improved immediately upon intravenous administration of a high-dose gammaglobulin treatment in all three patients. The TT virus (TTV) genome was detectable in the serum of two patients, in the duodenal fluid of one and in the liver of all three. By analyzing sequence homology, we observed that the respective TTV isolated from serum, duodenal fluid and liver tissue were completely identical in cases 2 and 3. These findings suggest that TTV infection was one of the contributing factors for neonatal cholestasis in these patients. TTV was isolated from the serum of two out of the three mothers. The viruses were either completely or almost identical in sequence to those isolated from their respective infants, suggesting that they had been transmitted from mother to infant in these 2 cases. The patients presented here, whose livers were infected with the TTV and showed a favorable response to gammaglobulin therapy, may represent a subset of idiopathic neonatal hepatitis patients.

AB  - Introduction TT virus has been recently isolated in Japan in patients with acute and chronic non-A/non-G hepatitis. Its possible etiopathogenetic role in causing hepatitis has been initially taken in consideration. On the contrary, more recent studies deny the importance of TT virus in causing liver damage. Most of the studies are based on serological data or on viral detection from frozen liver tissue. Aim of the study In the present paper we describe a method to detect viral genome from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded liver tissue. Materials and methods Twelve needle biopsies from liver were studied. Six cases were selected on the basis of serological negativity for HBV and HCV markers. Five cases of HCV-related chronic hepatitis and one HCV- and HIV-positive intravenous drug abuser were also included. All patients underwent liver biopsy, performed with a 14-G needle. Liver specimens were formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded as routine. From each block, sections were cut and stained for histopathologic examination. Additional 5 μm sections were employed to extract DNA for nested PCR. Results In 2 of 12 cases studied, TT virus genome was found. In both cas es the presence of viral DNA was confirmed by sequencing. Both patients were male. The first patient was a 39-year-old HIV- and HCV-positive intravenous drug abuser. The second patient was a 60-year-old heavy alcohol drinker. In both cases the presence of TT virus apparently did not affect the histological picture. Conclusion It is possible to detect TT virus genome from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue. This method offers the possibility to perform retrospective studies.

AB  - TT virus is a novel DNA virus widely distributed in the general population. We examined the prevalence of TTV infection in a population with acute non-A to E hepatitis and in comparison groups located in Northern Thailand. The prevalence of TTV in subjects with non-A-E hepatitis was 19% (21/112), 6% (4/72) in healthy volunteers, 17% (12/72) in those with hepatitis A or B, and 17% (8/48) in hospitalized patients with non-hepatitis illnesses. A significant association with TTV infection and non-A-E hepatitis was seen in all groups (OR 3.9, p = 0.02) and in children (OR 25.8, p = 0.001). Among subjects with non-A-E hepatitis, TTV was associated with higher alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels (significant for AST, p = 0.02). Our observations suggest that TTV in our study population may be associated with non-A-E hepatitis and that children in particular may be at risk of hepatocellular injury as a result of TTV infection.

AB  - AIM: To study the epidemiological features of transfusion transmitted virus(TTV) infection in China. METHODS: A total of 2229 cases of TTV infection from 12 895 subjects reported in Chinese medical current contents and diagnosed in our hospital from 1998 to 2001 were analyzed. RESULTS: TTV DNA was positive in 2229 of 12 895 subjects. The positive rate of TTV DNA was 9.5% (295/3092) in 3092 general population, and there was no significant difference among different regions (P >.05). Mean positive rate of TTV DNA was 15.5% (372/2400) in 2400 patients with different types of hepatitis. In patients with hepatitis A(HA), hepatitis B(HB), hepatitis C(HC), hepatitis E(HE) and hepatitis G(HG) the TTVDNA positive rates were 11.0% (16/145), 15.7% (252/1604), 16.6% (90/543), 8.5%(6/71) and 21.6% (8/37), respectively. Superinfection of TTV with HBV, HCV and HGV were higher than that with HAV and HEV, and there was no significant difference between them (P > 0.05). The positive rate of TTV DNA in non A-nonG hepatitis was 32.3% (525/1623); it was markedly higher than that in general population (P < 0.05). In patients with hemodialysis, sex transmitted disease (STD), blood donors, intravenous drug abusers and blood recipients, the TTVDNA positive rates were 28.3% (276/974), 20.5% (34/166), 14.0% (292/2089), 37.1% (81/218) and 33.0% (76/230), respectively, and were significantly higher in these cohorts than in general population (P > 0.05-0.001). The TTVDNA positive rate was 3.3% in 90 patients with bone marrow transplantation. The positive rate of TTVDNA was 19.1% (172/901) in sera of 901 mothers, and 20.5% (76/370) in breast milk, which was markedly higher than that in general population (P > 0.05), and 3.6% (27/742) in umbilical blood of their infants. In acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, the positive rates were 42.8% (74/173), 22.3% (119/533), 32.6% (28/86), 23.8% (20/84), and 21.0% (78/327), respectively, and were significantly higher than that in general population (P < 0.05 - 0.001), and other types of hepatitis (P > 0.05). Mean age in 1487 cases with positive TTV DNA was 39 years (range 1-78 years). There is no significant difference in the infection rate of TTV DNA between male and female (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: TTV infection is common in China, and may be single infection or superinfection with other hepatitis viruses. The routes of TTV transmission may be the same as HBV, HCV and HGV. TTV may be an important cause of non A-G hepatitis, and be one of the factors causing liver cirrhosis and hepatocelluar carcinoma. Hemodialysis and STD patients, blood recipients, blood donors and intravenous drug abusers are high risk populations of TTV infection. There is a possibility of maternal-fetal transmission of TTV. TTV mainly infects the young adults and without sexual difference.

AB  - To evaluate the molecular epidemiology and clinical significance of the TT virus (TTV) infection in healthy blood donors from southern Taiwan, 475 sera of healthy volunteer blood donors were tested for: TTV DNA, GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) anti-envelope protein 2 antibody and RNA. TTV DNA was positive in 111 donors (23.4%). Age and the rate of elevated ALT levels were significantly higher in TTV viremic donors than TTV non-viremic donors (P<0.01, P<0.05). Phylogenetic analysis of 49 donors revealed 22 (44.9%), 13 (32.7%), 1 (2%), 10 (20.4%), and 3 (6.1%) Taiwanese TTV isolates clustered in genotypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 4, respectively. By multivariate analyses, age and elevated ALT levels were significant factors associated with TTV viremia. In conclusion, TTV infection, predominant genotype 1, is highly prevalent in Taiwanese blood donors. TTV viremia is associated with increased age and elevated ALT levels.

AB  - The route of transmission of TT virus (TTV) was studied by examining the existence of TTV DNA in different body fluids from the new born infants and their mothers. A total of 52 pregnant women with normal serum alanine aminotransferase levels were enrolled in this study. TTV DNA was examined using a polymerase chain reaction method using Takahashi's primers which can detect all genotypes of TTV and Okamoto's primers which detect only some of the genotypes of TTV. TTV DNA was detected in the sera from 40/52 (77%), in the breast milk from 35/52 (67%), and in the amniotic fluid from 6/6 (100%) pregnant mothers using Takahashi's primers TTV DNA was also detected in the sera from 8 of 11 (73%) and in the cord blood from 25/52 (48%) new born infants using Takahashi's primers. However, TTV DNA was detected in only 5/52 maternal blood (10%) and 4/52 breast milk (8%) using Okamoto's primers. All samples positive for TTV DNA by Takahashi's primers, were also positive for TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) DNA. Our data suggest that intrauterine transmission or transmission via breast milk may contribute to maintaining the global TTV and TLMV reservoir. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - TT virus is a small, circular DNA virus, that has been associated with transfusion hepatitis. We sought to determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and to characterize the virus in terms of genotypic variability and in the relationship to CD4+, HIV viral loads, HCV/HIV coinfection, and ALT abnormalities. A cross-sectional analysis of HIV-infected patients in the United States, including 86 HIV-positive subjects and 118 HIV-negative controls was performed. TTV was detected using a seminested PCR technique. Samples underwent cloning and sequence analysis and/or RFLP to determine genotype. Thirty-eight percent of HIV-positive patients had TTV infection versus 14.4% of patients within the matching cohort (P = 0.0009). The highest rate of TTV infection was in patients with concurrent HCV/HIV infection (54% vs 30%, P = 0.038). HIV-infected subjects with TTV had lower ALT levels than those without TTV (P = 0.036). Intravenous drug use was the leading factor associated with TTV positivity among HIV-positive subjects. Mixed genotypes were more common in those with HIV. Therefore, TTV prevalence, ALT levels, and genomic heterogeneity of TTV all seem to be altered in patients with HIV.

AB  - AIM: To know the status of TTV infection in Changchun area. METHODS: The anti-TTV IgG in the sera of 213 patients with different digestive diseases including peptic ulcer, gastritis, gastroenteritis, hepatitis and cirrhosis of liver were measured by ELISA and the clinical features were analyzed. RESULTS: TTV infection could be seen in Changchun area and the infection rate was 7.98%; TTV infection was not associated with sex and age; TTV might transmit in both parenteral and non-parental ways; TTV infection was observed not only in patients with acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis of liver and liver cancer, but also in patients without abnormality of liver function test; TTV co-infection rate with HCV was higher than that of with HBV, however, TTV had no synergy on liver damage with HCV or HBV. CONCLUSION: There are TTV infected patients in Changchun. TTV infection may happen together with all kinds of liver diseases and shows a reciprocal association with HCV infection.

AB  - Recombinant factor VIII and factor IX concentrates, human-plasma-derived albumin, and samples from previously untreated patients with hemophilia were examined for the presence of TT virus (TTV) by using polymerase chain reaction testing. Blood samples from the patients were obtained prospectively before and every 3 to 6 months after therapy was begun. TTV was detected in 23.5% of the recombinant-product lots and 55.5% of the albumin lots tested. Only first-generation factor VIII recombinant concentrates stabilized with human albumin were positive for TTV, whereas all second-generation (human protein-free) concentrates were negative for the virus. In 59% of patients treated with either first- or second-generation recombinant factor concentrates, TTV infection developed at some point after the initial infusion. Infection with TTV in these patients before and after treatment did not appear to be clinically important. Thus, first-generation recombinant factor VIII concentrates may contain TTV and the source of the viral contamination may be human albumin. © 2001 by The American Society of Hematology.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a novel DNA virus that has been identified in patients with post-transfusional hepatitis of unknown aetiology. However, its pathogenic role in liver injury remains unclear. To determine its frequency and clinical impact in cryptogenic liver diseases, we investigated the TTV prevalence in patients with liver enzyme elevations of unknown aetiology and in healthy subjects. Fifty-four patients (33 male, 21 female) who have been followed up for elevated ALT/AST levels of unknown aetiology and 118 healthy subjects (99 male and 19 female) were included in the study. TTV DNA was investigated by the polymerase chain reaction. Other possible causes of transaminase elevation were excluded in detailed biochemical and serological tests. A liver biopsy was performed in 45 patients. TTV DNA was detected in 46 patients with liver enzyme elevations (85.1%) and in 94 healthy subjects (79.6%). There was no statistical difference between the groups (p=0.51). Histological examination of the liver revealed no specific change in TTV DNA positive patients that could be attributed to this virus infection. These results showed that TTV is a common virus in patients with liver enzyme elevation of unknown aetiology and even among healthy subjects in our geographical area. TTV infection is therefore widespread in the general population and does not seem to be associated with liver damage.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) DNA was quantitated in the serum and nine autopsy tissues (bone marrow, lymph node, muscle, thyroid gland, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, and kidney) obtained from each of three TTV-infected subjects by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which can detect all TTV genotypes. TTV DNA was detected in all examined tissues, with the viral load being equal to or up to 300 times higher than that in the corresponding serum (2.1×105 to 5.3×107 copies/g vs 1.2-3.9×105 copies/ml). Generally, the TTV viral load was higher in the bone marrow, lung, spleen, and liver than in the other tissues, although it varied by individual. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the PeR-amplified TTV DNA of 3.3 kilobases (kb) revealed considerable differences among the TTVs in the serum and tissue specimens from each subject. Further, the 3.3-kb amplicons from the serum and tissue specimens from one subject were molecularly cloned, and 30 clones each from the serum and each tissue specimen were subjected to RFLP and sequence analysis (total, 300 clones): the TTV clones were classified into six genotypes including four novel genotypes. The genotypic variability was remarkable: each specimen had one to five TTV genotypes at different frequencies. TTV DNA in replicative intermediate forms and TTV mRNA were detectable in all tissues tested. These results indicate the broad, uneven distribution of TTV genotypes in tissues and suggest that viral replication takes place in multiple tissues at distinct levels in infected individuals. © 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Three new detected viruses have been described (HEV, HGV and TTV). The degree of pathogenicity for the human being is very different. In some respect HEV resembles HAV, however, HEV induces high mortality to mother and child during pregnancy. Apparently, TTV and HGV are apathogenic for humans. Interestingly, TTV apparently induces lifelong viremia, whereas HGV is eliminated from the body after some time - without induction of apparent disease. Both viruses are therefore quite well adapted to the human body. Still - after transfusions - hepatitis is observed: A further virus is emerging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: TT virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus, was originally thought to be transmitted by transfusion. However, nonparenteral transmission is recently suspected to be a major mode of transmission. To investigate the possibility of reinfection with TTV in multiply transfused patients and to evaluate the significance of transfusion transmission of TTV in patients with hemophilia, serial changes in TTV genotype were investigated in three groups. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial changes in TTV genotype were investigated in 16 multiply transfused patients with hemophilia, 16 age-matched patients with chronic hepatitis C, and 16 age-matched healthy subjects. RESULTS: Mixed infection with multiple TTV genotypes was common in all groups. However, changes in TTV genotype were frequent in patients with hemophilia (15/16; 93.8%) but rare in patients with chronic hepatitis C and in healthy subjects (each group: 1/16; 6.3%). CONCLUSION: Changes in TTV genotype were frequently observed in multiply transfused patients with hemophilia but not in patients with chronic hepatitis or in healthy subjects without risk of transfusion transmission. This difference may suggest that exposure to TTV or even reinfection occurs frequently in patients with hemophilia, which could be evidence of transfusion transmission of TTV in this population.

AB  - Context: Despite changes in eligibility policies, practical barriers limit blood donations from individuals with hemochromatosis, increased knowledge of hemochromatosis donor characteristics may help foster further changes that will promote more donations. Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of donors diagnosed as having hemochromatosis and to compare rates of unreported deferrable risks for transfusion-transmissible viral infections (TTVIs), positive screening test results for TTVIs, and donation patterns between hemochromatosis patient donors and donors reporting no medical conditions necessitating phlebotomy (non-health-related donors). Design: An anonymous mail survey conducted in 1998 as part of the ongoing Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study. Setting and Participants: Among a stratified probability sample of 92 581 blood donors from 8 geographically diverse US blood centers, 52 650 (57%) responded. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalence of hemochromatosis among blood donors; prevalence of unreported deferrable risks and positive screening test results for TTVIs among hemochromatosis patient donors vs non-health-related donors. Results: One hundred ninety-seven respondents (0.4%) identified themselves as hemochromatosis patients and 50 079 (95.1%) as non-health-related donors. An estimated 0.8% of all donations were from hemochromatosis patients, 45.8% of whom reported that they had donated blood to treat their illness. The proportion of repeat donors was higher in hemochromatosis patients than in non-health-related donors (83.5% vs 76.5%; P=.03). Among repeat donors, 68.7% of hemochromatosis patients reported donating at least 3 times in the past year compared with 49.1% of non-health-related donors (P<.001). The prevalence of unreported deferrable risks for TTVIs was similar in hemochromatosis patients (2.0%) and non-health-related donors (3.1%) as was the overall prevalence of positive screening test results (1.3% of hemochromatosis patients vs 1.6% of non-health-related donors). Conclusions: Although significant numbers of hemochromatosis patients reported donating blood for therapeutic reasons, our findings suggest that this population does not present a greater risk to blood safety than other donors.

AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection in various population groups from Athens, Greece, was assessed by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using two primer sets from distinct regions of the genome: the conventional set derived from the open reading frame-1 (ORF-1) and the new, highly sensitive set targeting the region that includes the TATA signal localized upstream of ORF-2. Based on both primer sets, TTV DNA was detected in 42/50 (84.0%) healthy individuals, 42/50 (84.0%) chronic hepatitis C patients, 31/39 (79.5%) acute non-A-E hepatitis patients (group I), 14/16 (87.5%) renal failure patients with acute non-A-E hepatitis (group II), 47/50 (94.0%) intravenous drug users (IVDU), 36/50 (72.0%) hemophiliacs, and 21/31 (67.7%) hemodialysis patients. The presence of TTV was not associated with any particular risk group, and no differences were observed in relation to demographic, biochemical and virological characteristics between TTV DNA-positive and -negative patients. TTV did not seem to have a profound effect on the course of chronic C or acute non-A-E hepatitis either. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that TTV strains circulating in the greater metropolitan area of Athens belong not only to the G1 and G2 genotypes that are encountered worldwide, but also to G3 and to G5 that are found mainly in Europe and Asia, respectively. Further studies will shed light on the role of this highly prevalent virus. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - An unenveloped single-stranded virus, which might be a causative agent for posttransfusion non-A-G hepatitis, was recently found and named 'TT virus' (TTV). There is still controversy over the role of TTV in chronic hepatitis. Therefore, we have examined the prevalence of TTV in various types of chronic hepatitis in Japan. TTV DNA was detected in 11 of 40 patients (27.5%) with non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis, 13 of 46 patients (28.3%) with type B chronic hepatitis, 21 of 55 patients (38.2%) with type C chronic hepatitis, and 41 of 131 subjects (31.3%) with normal liver function tests. The positivity rate for TTV DNA tended to increase with age. The detection rate did not differ statistically between non-B, non-C chronic hepatitis and type B or type C chronic hepatitis, or normal subjects. The distribution of TTV genotypes was not significantly different among them. Clinical characteristics of the chronic illness were similar for patients with or without TTV in all hepatitis groups. The etiologic role of TTV in chronic hepatitis is not confirmed from the statistical and clinical standpoint. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Many recent and significant advances in the field of chronic viral hepatitis, including therapy, suggest that an update on chronic hepatitis is timely. Chronic hepatitis B virus infection remains a significant worldwide cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, despite the wide availability of a long established and effective vaccine. Transmission occurs via perinatal, sexual, and parenteral routes (particularly intravenous drug abuse and although blood products still carry a risk, this is now extremely low in Western countries). Only a minority of infected adult cases develop chronic hepatitis but in children under 1 year, 90% develop chronic hepatitis. The clinical spectrum of chronic liver injury ranges from mild inflammation to end stage liver cirrhosis. Interferon alfa has been the mainstay of treatment for patients with active disease but nucleoside analogues (lamivudine and adefovir) are now available with similar efficacy. Patients with end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma can be offered transplantation but infection in the graft is commonplace. The combination of hepatitis B immunoglobulin and newer antiviral drugs reduce the incidence and severity of graft infection significantly. The hepatitis C virus epidemic of the latter half of the 20th century now affects more than 1% of populations worldwide. This RNA virus is spread parenterally and is becoming the leading indication for liver transplantation. The majority of patients develop chronic hepatitis, which may be progressive, evolving to significant liver disease (cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma) in about 20% cases after decades. Treatment with the combination of interferon alfa and ribavirin is successful in up to 40% cases. Liver transplantation is a therapeutic option for some but graft infection is universal and often complicated by progressive liver fibrosis. A vaccine remains a remote prospect so that prevention is crucial. Hepatitis D virus infection occurs on a background of hepatitis B virus infection and can also cause liver damage. The response to antiviral therapy is poor. The newer "hepatitis" viruses G and TT do not cause significant liver injury.

AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) DNA among 244 healthy individuals in 23 cities on 12 islands in Indonesia was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers derived from the coding region (N22), which can detect TTV DNA of genotypes 1-6. By N22 PCR, TTV DNA was detected in 102 (42%) individuals. The amplified PCR products were molecularly cloned and three clones each were subjected to sequence analysis. Three hundred one (98%) of the 306 TTV clones were classified into genotype 1, 2 or 3, and none into genotypes 4-6. The remaining five clones from two individuals (Kt-08 and Kt-10) on Kutai, Kalimantan Island, differed by >30% from known TTV isolates of all 21 genotypes and were tentatively classified into genotypes 22 and 23, respectively. Using primers specific for the new TTV genotype 22 or 23, TTV genotype 22 was detected significantly more frequently in Kutai than in the other 22 cities (41% vs. 5%, P < 0.001). TTV genotype 23 was restricted to Kutai (17% vs. 0%, P < 0.001), suggesting the indigenous nature of this genotype. Analysis of two TTV isolates (Kt-08F and Kt-10F) demonstrated the extreme diversity of TTV and the preservation of the genomic organization and transcription profile.

AB  - Three new detected viruses have been described (HEV, HGV and TTV). The degree of pathogenicity for the human being is very different. In some respect HEV resembles HAV, however, HEV induces high mortality to mother and child during pregnancy. Apparently, TTV and HGV are apathogenic for humans. Interestingly, TTV apparently induces lifelong viremia, whereas HGV is eliminated from the body after some time - without induction of apparent disease. Both viruses are therefore quite well adapted to the human body. Still - after transfusions - hepatitis is observed: A further virus is emerging.

AB  - Objective - To determine the prevalence of GB virus-C (GBV-C) RNA and TT virus (TTV) DNA in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and osteoarthritis (OA) as well as to compare the autoantibody pattern in patients with SSc with and without evidence of viral infection. Patients and methods - The study included 168 patients (84 SSc, 41 RA, and 43 OA) diagnosed according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria and 122 volunteer blood donors. The presence of GBV-C RNA and TTV DNA in serum was assessed by nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and semi-nested PCR, respectively. Autoantibodies in patients with SSc were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Hep-2 immunofluorescence. Results - TTV-DNA was detected in 10/84 (12%) patients with SSc, 9/41 (22%) patients with RA, 3/43 (7%) patients with OA, and 16/122 (13%) blood donors. GBV-C RNA was present in 4/84 (5%) patients with SSc, 2/43 (5%) patients with OA, and 5/122 (4%) blood donors. No patient with RA was positive for GBV-C RNA. One patient with SSc and one patient with OA showed a double infection with GBV-C and TTV. 74/84 (88%) patients with SSc were positive for at least one autoantibody species tested: 18/84 (21%) showed anti-centromeric autoantibodies, 55/84 (66%) a speckled (36/84 (43%) fine, 19/84 (23%) coarse), and 20/84 (24%) a homogeneous nuclear Hep-2 pattern, and 21/84 (25%) had antinucleolar autoantibodies. Anti-Scl-70 antibodies were found in 31/84 (37%) and anti-RNP antibodies in 5/84 (6%) patients with SSc. No differences in the autoantibody pattern in patients with SSc with or without viral infection could be detected. Conclusion - The prevalence of GBV-C RNA and TTV DNA in serum samples from patients with SSc, RA, and OA was low and comparable with that in blood donors. A continuing infection with TTV and or GBV-C was not associated with a significant change in the autoantibody pattern in patients with SSc. These data provide no evidence for an association between GBV-C and/or TTV infections and SSc and/or arthritis (RA and OA).

AB  - Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), plasma, saliva and urine samples were collected from 50 thalassaemic patients for TT virus (TTV) detection by two sets of PCR. The set B nested PCR was more sensitive than the widely used NG hemi-nested PCR with TTV positive rates ≈ PBMC: 98% vs. 70%; plasma: 92% vs. 66%; saliva: 62% vs. 22%; urine: 22% vs. 6%. All 50 patients had TTV detected in one or more specimens, with 16% of patients being positive in all four specimen types: 40% positive in PBMC, plasma and saliva; 30% positive in PBMC and plasma. In 82 NG hemi-nested PCR-positive samples TTV genotype was identified, 68.3% had a single genotype, 25.6% had multiple genotypes and 6.1% were uncharacterized. The positive rates for genotypes by specimen were: G1 (36/82), G2 (49/82), G3 (2/82), G4 (7/82), G5 (1/82) and G6 (3/82). Among the 42 patients for whom the genotype was examined, 42.9% had single-type infection, 45.2% had co-infections and 11.9% had uncharacterized genotypes. Sixteen of them had TTV detected both in PBMC and plasma with seven having identical genotypes in both samples. Eight patients had TTV detected in PBMC, plasma and saliva; two of them harboured identical genotypes in all three samples. The results indicate that, apart from hepatocytes, PBMC is a major cell type for TTV infection occurs. Shedding of TTV in urine and saliva is common and may have a significant role in nonblood-borne transmission among the general population. TTV-infected patients often harbour multiple genotypes suggesting infection with one genotype does not necessarily confer protection against the others. No correlation between TTV infection and liver dysfunction was observed.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The TT virus (TTV) is a member of a newly described family of human viruses related to the Circoviridae viruses. Its association with specific diseases has not been established, and screening of blood donors has not been implemented. To date, 16 genotypes have been identified. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Sera from 471 healthy blood donors (aged 11-58 years) were randomly selected and tested for TTV by the use of two sets of primers: NG59d/NG61d/NG63d primers and T801/T935 primers. Quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR) was developed to measure the TTV DNA concentration among the blood donors. Sequencing of a part of the genome was performed to identify the various genotypes. Several samples showed a mixed genotype infection. RESULTS: TTV was detected in 251 (53.3%) of 471 healthy Hong Kong blood donors by the use of NG59d/ NG61d/NG63d primers. The prevalence of the virus increased steadily with age (p = 0.03). TTV DNA was detected in 90 percent (90 of a randomly selected 100) of samples by the use of T801/T935 primers. TTV DNA concentration was also measured by QC-PCR in the blood donors who were positive for TTV DNA in the first round of the heminested PCR. TTV titers ranged from 4.8 × 102 copies per mL to 6 × 104 copies per mL, with a median value of 1.2 × 104 copies per mL. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of a 223-bp fragment from open reading frame 1 showed three main genotypes (G1 [60.7%], G2 [24.3%], and G3 [14%]) and a new genotype 17 (G17), with the latter bearing 60-percent nucleotide homology with other genotypes deposited at GenBank. In addition, a new TTV subtype, G2f, was found. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of TTV is high in healthy Chinese blood donors. Three main genotypes (G1, G2, and G3) were detected. In addition, a new TTV genotype, tentatively designated as G17, and a new subtype, G2f, were identified.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) can replicate not only in the liver but also in hematopoietic cells. To investigate the possible influence of TTV infection on the hematological parameters of patients with chronic liver disease, serum samples from 581 patients with chronic, viral or non-viral liver disease were tested for TTV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR was performed by two distinct methods using N22 primer pairs (N22 PCR), which detect primarily the four major TTV genotypes (1-4), and using genotype 1-specific primers (Genotype 1-PCR). Thirteen hematological parameters measured in routine laboratory tests were compared among the patients who were positive or negative for TTV infection. The platelet count was significantly lower in the N22 PCR-positive group than in the N22 PCR-negative group among the 189 patients with chronic hepatitis C (CH-C) and among the 40 patients with chronic hepatitis without serological markers of ongoing hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection (CH-NBNC) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.005, respectively). Similarly, among the patients with CH-C or CH-NBNC, the platelet count was significantly lower in the TTV genotype 1-positive group than in the TTV genotype 1-negative group (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, respectively). The reduced platelet count of the TTV DNA-positive group was observed in every fibrotic stage of chronic hepatitis (F0-F3). These results suggest that infection of TTV of certain genotypes including genotype 1 may worsen the thrombocytopenia of patients with CH-C or CH-NBNC, irrespective of the degree of hepatic fibrosis. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Early estimates of the prevalence of TTV viremia in healthy adults of developed countries were in the order of 1-10 %, while similar estimates in Third World countries were considerably higher. Using three different PCRs, TTV-related DNA was detected in serum from 180 out of the 201 Norwegian blood donors tested, indicating that these viruses are almost universally present in adults. Sequence analysis revealed heterogeneity similar to what is found world-wide. The data suggest that the previous discrepancy in prevalences might be related to a lower serum concentration of virus in developed countries. The high prevalence adds evidence to the benign nature of the virus. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background: the heterogeneity of the TT virus (TTV) DNA prevalence values reported from comparable human cohorts suggests that diagnostic PCR protocols still require to be optimized. Objectives: to design TTV PCR primer sets with low genotype restriction and to compare their performances with commonly used amplification systems. Study design: we compared full length TTV genomic sequences and identified conserved nucleotide patterns in the 5′ and 3′ non-coding regions of the viral genome. This permitted to design two new primer sets usable for the PCR amplification of the most divergent human isolates of TTV described to date. The performances of these amplification systems were compared with those of three other PCR systems earlier used for prevalence studies. Results: the primer systems P5Bx and P3Bx exhibited higher PCR scores than the other systems tested; 14 to 34% improvement values were obtained, and divergent positive results of earlier described PCR systems were confirmed systematically by our new detection assays. Conclusions: an optimized detection of TT virus DNA is a pre-requisite for the accurate epidemiological survey of viral infection and for the realization of phylogenetic studies. Such PCR systems with low genotype restriction will be helpful in the future for a better knowledge of natural history of TT virus infection. Copyright © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Background: The most recent polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection protocols for the TT virus (TTV) permit one to identify the presence of viral DNA in the serum of a majority of healthy individuals, in the absence of any particular risk factor. This is in contrast with previous epidemiological studies that reported a higher prevalence of TTV infection in populations such as haemodialysis patients (HD), haemophiliacs, intravenous drug users or diabetics. Objectives: To show that these discrepant results were due to the different sensitivity (number of viral copies detected) of the detection protocols used in initial and more recent epidemiological studies. Study design and results: We designed a standardised primary PCR assay that detects only viraemia &gt; 5 × 103 to 5 × 104 copies/ml for genotypes 1, 2 and 3, and compared the results of this test with those of a nested PCR assay which is 100-fold more sensitive. Viraemia &gt; 5 × 103 to 5 × 104 copies/ml were statistically more frequent in HD patients (54.3%), diabetics (54.7%), and HIV-infected patients with CD4 cells &lt; 200/mm3 (69%) than in blood donors (37%) or HIV-infected patients with CD4 cells &gt; 500/mm3 (33%). Conclusions: These data suggest a possible relationship between the prevalence of elevated viral loads and the level of immunocompetence of the populations studied, and therefore that of an immune control of TTV viraemia. This corroborates previous findings showing that the stimulation of the immune system by an interferon treatment was able to clear TTV viraemia. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - Epidemiological studies have demonstrated a correlation between oral lichen planus and different liver diseases. The new virus termed TT virus (TTV) is highly prevalent in patients with chronic hepatitis of different etiology and it may be speculated that TT virus may be involved in the pathogenesis of oral lichen planus. This study examined the presence of TT virus DNA in serum by PCR and in oral mucosa biopsies by in situ hybridization from 20 patients with oral lichen planus (13 with chronic hepatitis and seven without liver disease). Serum and oral mucosa biopsies from six patients all with chronic hepatitis with leukoplakia were also studied as controls. TT virus DNA was positive in the serum of 17/20 (85%) of the patients with oral lichen planus and in all the controls. TT virus DNA hybridization signals were detected in mucosa biopsies from all the patients with TT virus DNA in serum but in none of the three cases without this marker. The percentage of positive cells ranged from 1.6-80%. No differences were found in the percentage of positive cells between TT virus positive patients with and without oral lichen plan us and there was no relationship between the number of positive cells and the intensity of the inflammatory infiltrate. In conclusion, TT virus infects oral epithelial cells but the results do not support a role for TT virus in causing oral lichen planus. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) loads associated with the peripheral blood cells of seven patients known to carry the virus in plasma were investigated by real-time PCR. Whereas red cells/platelets were uniformly negative, six and four patients yielded positive peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and polymorphonuclear leukocytes, respectively, but viral titres were generally low. Fractionation of PBMCs into monocyte- and B, T4, and T8 lymphocyte-enriched subpopulations showed no pattern in the viral loads that might suggest the preferential association of TTV to one or more specific cell types. TTV-negative PBMCs absorbed measurable amounts of virus when incubated with infected plasma at 4°C. Furthermore, cultures of TTV-negative phytohaemagglutinin-stimulated PBMCs exposed in vitro to virus-positive plasma and faecal extracts released considerable levels of infectious TTV into the supernatant fluid and the same was true for TTV-positive stimulated PBMCs. These results indicate that, whereas freshly harvested resting PBMCs seem to produce little, if any TTV, stimulated PBMCs actively replicate the virus. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is much more prevalent than we once imagined. With the use of primers designed from the noncoding regions, a more than 90% rate of TTV infection in the general population by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been reported, showing that nonparenteral transmission must play an important role to its epidemiology. We considered that TTV may be secreted through bile juice into feces to establish nonparenteral infection. Paired bile juice and serum samples were obtained from 26 patients who were receiving bile drainage. Feces were also recovered after the drainage tube was removed. TTV DNA was detected from 22 patients in serum (84.6%), and they were all TTV DNA positive in bile juice. Most feces samples recovered from TTV-positive patients were also TTV DNA positive. Secretion of TTV into bile juice appears to be common, and this could play an important role to its transmission and its epidemiology.

AB  - The present investigation compared the histological findings in the liver of chronic hepatitis C patients who were or were not co-infected with TT virus (TTV) to determine the histological and clinical characteristics of TTV infection. One hundred eighty patients with chronic hepatitis or liver cirrhosis type C were included in this study. Serum samples were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by a nested polymerase chain reaction. The liver biopsy specimen of each patient was examined, and scores were assigned to indicate the severity of each of the following features: inflammatory cell infiltration in the periportal, parenchymal, and portal areas; fibrous stage; lymphoid reaction in the portal area; portal sclerotic change; perivenular fibrosis; pericellular fibrosis; damage of bile duct; and irregular regeneration of hepatocytes. Sixty-four (34.4%) of the 180 patients were positive for TTV DNA. The histological features of the liver and the blood biochemical parameters of the TTV DNA-positive and TTV DNA-negative patients, did not differ significantly except for the score of irregular regeneration (IR) of hepatocytes. Among those in the F4 stage of fibrosis, the score of IR of the TTV DNA-positive patients was significantly higher than that of the TTV DNA-negative patients. In conclusion, chronic TTV infection does not modify the biochemical features of chronic hepatitis type C patients. TTV may be a risk factor, however, for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with type C liver disease in the F4 stage. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) has been reported to occur in association with elevated alanine amino-transferase (ALT) levels in patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. We examined whether the presence, change of DNA titer, or variation in sequence of this virus is associated with acute or chronic liver dysfunction in Japanese. We detected TTV by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers generated from the conserved region of the TTV genome. Direct DNA sequencing of the original N22 region was used to characterize TTV isolates. We detected TTV DNA in 15 (25%) of 60 patients with liver dysfunction. Variants recovered from infected patients formed four genotypes/subtypes, corresponding to G1a, G1b, G2, and G4. Although TTV DNA titers in patients with G2 and G4 were lower than those with G1, TTV was consistently detected regardless of genotype/subtype. TTV infection continued for at least 1 year after normalization of ALT level in patients with acute liver dysfunction. Changes in DNA titer, substitutions of deduced amino acids, and variety of quasispecies of TTV were detected during the observation period, but no significant fluctuation in ALT level was found. We conclude that persistent infection, changes in DNA titer, and variation in sequence of this novel virus are not significantly related to hepatic disorders. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The sera of 38 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), were tested for TT virus (TTV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using three different primer pairs (UTR PCR, N22 PCR and genotype-1 PCR), and various histological features of the liver biopsy specimens were compared among those who were positive or negative for TTV infection. By UTR PCR which detects all TTV genotypes, TTV DNA was detected in 37 (97%) of the 38 patients. In contrast, N22 PCR which detects primarily TTV genotypes 1-4, detected TTV DNA in 18 patients (47%). In the liver biopsy specimens, moderate to many acidophilic bodies, moderate to marked focal/spotty necrosis of hepatocytes and marked stellate, pericellular or perivenular fibrosis were observed significantly more frequently among those who were positive for TTV DNA by N22 PCR, than among those who were negative by N22 PCR. Twelve patients (32%) were positive for TTV genotype 1. Moderate to marked vacuolation of nuclei, moderate to many acidophilic bodies, and moderate to marked focal/spotty necrosis as well as marked stellate, pericellular or perivenular fibrosis were found significantly more frequently in the TTV genotype 1-positive group than in the TTV genotype 1-negative group. These results suggest that certain TTV genotypes including genotype 1 influence the necrosis and inflammation of hepatocytes and liver fibrosis in NAFLD patients. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Background/Aims: In approximately 5% of chronic liver disease cases, no aetiology can be identified. We selected sera from 50 patients with chronic hepatitis of unknown aetiology who were enrolled in this follow-up study whose aim is to gain insight into the possible role of viruses and to define potential clinical outcomes. Methods: Patients' sera were screened with highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction assays for hepatitis B (HBV), C, D, and G viruses and TT virus. Sera were also retested for antibodies against the core antigen of HBV. Results: Surprisingly, HBV DNA was detected in both serum and liver in 15/50 (30%) patients. Immunostaining for HBV antigens on biopsies from patients positive for HBV DNA showed HBcAg and/or HBsAg expression at low levels in 9/15 samples. Eleven of the fifteen patients were anti-HBc positive. With one exception, all patients carried HBV genomes at low levels (104 copies/ml or less). Histological signs of chronic liver disease were observed in all patients. Conclusion: Unrecognised HBV infections may account for a high proportion of chronic hepatitis cases of unknown aetiology. Improved HBV detection tests, which appear mandatory for the diagnosis and management of non-A non-E hepatitis as well as for improved safety of transfusions and transplantations are needed. © 2001 European Association for the Study of the Liver.

AB  - TTV, the transfusion transmissible hepatitis virus infects mainly patients at risk for parenteral exposure and hence, prone to develop chronic liver disease, as well as healthy populations worldwide. Most TTV infections appear to occur parenterally, with viremia detected frequently in blood donors and blood products. The substantial proportion of asymptomatic individuals never exposed to blood-borne agents, and its high prevalence among healthy subjects implicates the fecal-oral route as another potential for transmission. According to the TTV DNA levels detected in liver tissue, it apparently replicates in hepatocytes, and TTV DNA is present in sera of patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology closely correlated with ALT levels. However, TTV initiating the development of chronic liver disease or causing posttransfusion hepatitis could not be confirmed, as most patients positive for TTV DNA remain asymptomatic and those progressing towards chronic liver disease are invariably coinfected with either the hepatitis B or C virus. Also, TTV coinfection does not aggravate the symptoms associated with hepatitis B or C. Similarly, it does not cause posthepatitis aplastic anemia, and high-risk patients can immunologically clear the viral DNA. In conclusion, being widely distributed and apparently nonpathogenic, TTV might represent an opportunistic but innocent virus reminiscent of hepatitis G virus, with a negligible role in the etiology of chronic liver disease.

AB  - -The emergence and re-emergence of viral infections is an ongoing process. - Large-scale vaccination programmes led to the eradication or control of some viral infections in the last century, but new viruses are always emerging. - Increased travel is leading to a rise in the importation of exotic infections such as dengue and hepatitis E, but also of hepatitis A, which is no longer endemic. - Apart from import diseases new viruses have appeared (Nipah-virus and transfusion-transmitted virus). - Existing viruses may suddenly cause more severe diseases, e.g. infection by enterovirus 71. - The distribution area of a virus may change, e.g. in case of West Nile virus, an Egyptian encephalitis virus that appears to have established itself in the USA. - Furthermore, there is no such thing as a completely new virus; it is always an existing virus that has adapted itself to another host or that was already present in humans but has only recently been discovered. - A number of factors facilitate the emergence of new infectious diseases. These include intensive animal husbandry and the transport of animals. The unexpected appearance of West Nile virus in the western hemisphere was possibly due to animal transportation.

AB  - Objectives: To investigate the prevalence and relative titre of TT virus (TTV) DNA, and to examine the relationship between the extent of TTV viraemia and the immune status among 144 patients with HIV infection; 178 age- and sex-matched healthy individuals were also studied. Methods: TTV DNA was detected quantitatively by two distinct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods [untranslated region (UTR) and N22]. UTR PCR detects all TTV genotypes, and N22 PCR can primarily detect four major TTV genotypes (1-4). Results: Using UTR PCR and N22 PCR, respectively, TTV DNA was detected significantly more frequently in HIV-infected patients than in controls (99 versus 91%, P &lt; 0.001; 56 versus 27%, P &lt; 0.0001), and the relative titre (10N/ml) was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients [4.5 ± 1.2 (mean ± SD) versus 3.1 ± 0.9, P &lt; 0.0001; 2.6 ± 1.5 versus 1.5 ± 0.9, P &lt; 0.0001]. Age, sex, co-infection with hepatitis B or C virus, and risk factors for HIV transmission did not appear to be significant factors associated with the titre of TTV viraemia. However, the titre of TTV DNA was significantly higher in HIV-infected patients with AIDS (P &lt; 0.0001), those with low CD4 T cell count (P &lt; 0.0001), or those with high HIV viral loads (P = 0.0047). Conclusion: TTV is highly prevalent and high-titred in HIV-infected patients. The TTV viral load may reflect the degree of immune status of these immunocompromised hosts. © 2001 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.

AB  - Background/Aims: A recently detected DNA virus (TTV) has been assumed to be responsible for posttransfusion hepatitis in humans. Until now it is unclear whether patients on maintenance hemodialysis are at increased risk of acquiring TTV. Methods: Serum samples derived from 143 chronically hemodialyzed patients were examined for TTV viremia by nested PCR. All serum specimens were also investigated for viremia and for the presence of antibodies of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) by PCR and serological assays, respectively. Results: The prevalence of TTV was determined to be 18.8% (n = 27), for HCV a prevalence of 15.4% (n = 22) and for GBV-C/HGV of 8.4% (n = 12) could be demonstrated. Parallel infection by TTV and HCV was detected in only 1.4% (n = 2) of the patients. In no serum sample could TTV and GBV-C/HGV be detected in parallel. None of the solely TTV-viremic individuals had clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease. Conclusion: From our data we conclude that TTV viremia is widespread among hemodialysis patients and can be detected in 18.8%. Since no viremic patient had clinical or biochemical signs of liver disease, the hepatitis-inducing capacity of TTV remains unclear. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - The prevalence of antibodies directed against the enterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) was measured in 2 groups of people living in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Of 1,056 health care workers (HCWs), 778 (73.7%) were anti-HAV positive. A high prevalence of anti-HAV antibodies (85.7%) was also found among 274 voluntary blood donors (BDs). TT virus (TTV) is a DNA virus that has been found in the sera of patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. Occurrence of virus shedding suggests that the fecal-oral route may be an important mode of TTV transmission, particularly in the developing world. The presence of TTV DNA was analyzed by PCR in the sera of 191 HCWs and 151 BDs. TTV was detected in 65.4% of HCWs and 79.5% of BDs. In both groups, a family income of < US$400 per month and a level of education of < 11 y of schooling were found to be risk factors for HAV infection. Furthermore, a low family income was associated with TTV viremia in the HCW group. However, the presence of TTV DNA was associated with neither low level of education nor anti-HAV positivity.

AB  - TT virus is a novel hepatitis-associated DNA virus that has been provisionally designated as transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV). Infection by TTV has been frequently demonstrated in humans. Few reports, however, have been published on the epidemiology of TTV infection in patients with ESRD. The prevalence of TTV in patients undergoing maintenance dialysis varies widely and various demographic, virologic or clinical features can explain these differences; in some series, the prevalence of TTV in HD was significantly higher than in control groups. Blood transfusion requirement and nosocomial transmission of TTV within dialysis units seem to be important in the diffusion of TTV in the HD setting; however, other routes of TTV acquisition may play a role. The clinical significance related to the presence of TTV in HD population remains unclear; it is possible that TTV may aggravate liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. The natural history of TTV in dialysis is an area of avide research, since TTV has a propensity for establishing long-term infection in HD patients. The possibility that TTV causes pathological changes outside the liver cannot be ruled out. Further studies are in progress to understand the natural history and the epidemiology of TTV infection in patients with ESRD.

AB  - Viral infection has been shown to induce aplastic anemia, unidentified types of hepatitis being the most common cause for aplastic anemia-associated viral hepatitis. The survival rate for this group of patients after bone marrow transplantation with stem cells from an HLA-matched sibling is not well known. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of hepatitis G virus (HGV) and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection in non-A, non-B, non-C hepatitis associated-aplastic anemia (HAAA) patients, and to define the role of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) as a therapeutic modality for this disease. Sixty-eight patients (43 males and 25 females) with aplastic anemia, underwent allogeneic BMT at the Hadassah University Hospital between 1981 and 1997. Onset of hepatitis was defined as jaundice and elevated alanine aminotransaminase (ALT) levels. Onset of aplastic anemia was defined as the first date on which varying degrees of pancytopenia occurred: hemoglobin level below 10 g/dl, WBC below 2 × 109/l and low platelet count 10 × 1010/l. Serial serum samples from HAAA patients were assayed for virological and/or serological markers of hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G viruses, TTV and parvovirus B19. Seventeen of the 68 patients with aplastic anemia (25%) suffered from hepatitis, 12 males and five females, ages 5 to 36 years. The mean interval between onset of hepatitis and first indication of aplastic anemia was 62 days (range 14-225 days). The development of aplastic anemia was unrelated to age, sex or severity of hepatitis. Ten of the 17 patients (59%) achieved complete ALT recovery prior to the diagnosis of aplastic anemia. Serum samples were available for 15 patients; none had evidence of acute or active hepatitis A, B, C, D, E, G and TTV virus infection at the time of diagnosis. Parvovirus B19 DNA sequences were not detectable in 10 of 12 tested cases; two positive results were detected in serum samples obtained after blood transfusion, making the analysis of these positive results difficult. All 17 patients underwent BMT. The mean post-BMT follow-up period was 38 months (range 1 day-123 months), five patients (30%) died 1 to 160 days post BMT, and 12 (70%) are alive 31 to 123 months after BMT. Relapsing hepatitis was not observed in any of the patients. In conclusion, HAAA is a disease of the young and the etiologic agent associated with HAAA remains unknown. HGV, TTV and parvovirus B19 sequences were not detected in any of the HAAA cases. The survival rate after BMT with stem cells from an HLA-matched sibling is similar to that for patients with non-hepatitis-associated aplastic anemia.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV) was newly identified in 1997 in Japan. At present intensive research of this virus is underway worldwide. The authors present a review of hitherto assembled findings on the structure of the TTV genome, its classification, diagnosis, epidemiology, spread in the human population and its effect on the human organism. The exact way of transmission and importance of TTV in the pathogenesis of human disease still remains obscure. The subject of interest is in particular the affinity of this agent to hepatic tissue and the possible part played in different types of affections of the liver parenchyma.

AB  - Patients with chronic renal failure on hemodialysis have a high risk of infections with viruses such as hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), GB virus C/hepatitis G (GBV-C/HGV) and TT (TTV) viruses. The prevalence of HBV, HCV, GBV-C/HGV and TTV in patients with chronic renal failure who are on conservative management before entering into a hemodialysis program (predialysis) in comparison with hemodialyzed patients was studied to elucidate whether the high prevalence of these viruses is influenced by that observed in the predialysis stage. The presence of hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg), HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and TTV DNA was analyzed in sera from 80 patients with chronic renal failure (35 on predialysis and 45 on hemodialysis). HBsAg, HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected in one (2.8%), six (17.1%), eight (22.5%) and 16 (45.7%) of the 35 patients on predialysis. Two (5.7%) of these patients were coinfected with HCV and GBV-C/HGV, whereas six (17.1%) had GBV-C/HGV and TTV coinfection. In the 45 hemodialyzed patients, HBsAg, HCV RNA, GBV-C/HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected in one (2.2%), two (4.4%), seven (15.5%) and 26 (57.7%). One (2.2%) patient had HBV and TTV coinfection, two (4.4%) HCV and TTV coinfection whereas four (8.8%) were coinfected with GBV-C/HGV and TTV. No differences regarding age, gender, previous surgery and number of transfusions were found between infected and uninfected patients within and between both groups. In conclusion, the prevalence of the viruses studied in predialysis may influence their prevalence in dialysis units. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Background and Objectives. Patients with thalassemia-major are at risk of blood-borne viral infections. TT virus (TTV), a single stranded, circular DNA virus, has recently been found to be associated with acute and chronic hepatitis, The aims of this study were to assess the prevalence of TTV infection in adult patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia, and to evaluate the clinical significance of TTV. Design and Methods. We studied 68 adult patients with thalassemia major, 97% of whom were hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody positive. TTV DNA was amplified from serum by heminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Direct sequencing of PCR products was used to establish TTV genotypes. Results. TTV DNA was detected in 47 patients (69.1%). Sequence analysis of PCR products identified TTV genotype 1b as the most common viral genotype in this group. Patients co-infected by HCV and TTV had a significantly higher histologic grade score than patients with isolated HCV infection (5.1±2.7 vs. 2.8±1.7, p=0.02) while the stage score was not significantly different. Interpretation and Conclusions. TTV is highly prevalent among Italian multiply transfused patients. In these patients TTV viremia appears to affect the necro-inflammatory activity of hepatitis C, though no evidence of an effect on the evolution of fibrosis was found. © 2001, Ferrata Storti Foundation.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) infection is extremely widespread in the general population. A sensitive real-time PCR assay was developed that quantitated accurately the most prevalent TTV genotypes in Italy. When used to test 217 individuals for TTV viraemia, the overall prevalence was 94%. Viraemia levels varied widely amongst individual subjects, with no major differences related to gender or age. The highest TTV titres were in haemophiliacs and in patients with non-A-E hepatitis, but they did not differ from the group with miscellaneous diseases. HIV-and HCV-infected subjects and patients with primary liver diseases had TTV loads similar to those of healthy individuals. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first described in 1997 by representational difference analysis of sera from non-A to non-G posttransfusion hepatitis patients and hence intensively investigated as a possible addition to the list of hepatitis-inducing viruses. The TTV genome is a covalently closed single-stranded DNA of approximately 3.8 kb with a number of characteristics typical of animal circoviruses, especially the chicken anemia virus. TTV is genetically highly heterogeneous, which has led investigators to group isolates into numerous genotypes and subtypes and has limited the sensitivity of many PCR assays used for virus detection. The most remarkable feature of TTV is the extraordinary high prevalence of chronic viremia in apparently healthy people, up to nearly 100% in some countries. The original hypothesis that it might be an important cause of cryptogenic hepatitis has not been borne out, although the possibility that it may produce liver damage under specific circumstances has not been excluded. The virus has not yet been etiologically linked to any other human disease. Thus, TTV should be considered an orphan virus.

AB  - The sera of 43 patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) who abstained from alcohol for 4 weeks, were tested for TT virus (TTV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using three different primer pairs (UTR PCR, N22 PCR and genotype-1 PCR). The clinical course of the TTV DNA-positive and -negative groups was compared. By UTR PCR which detects all TTV genotypes, TTV DNA was detected in 40 patients (93%). N22 PCR which detects primarily TTV genotypes 1-6, detected TTV DNA in 17 patients (40%). The alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level 4 weeks after the start of abstinence was significantly higher and the rate of change in ALT {[(ALT on admission - ALT 4 weeks after abstinence)/(ALT on admission)] × 100} was lower in the patients who were positive by N22 PCR, than in those who were negative by N22 PCR. Twelve patients (28%) were positive for TTV genotype 1. In the TTV genotype 1-positive group, the ALT 4 weeks after the start of abstinence was significantly higher, and the improvement rates of ALT, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase and alkaline phosphatase levels were lower than those in the TTV genotype 1-negative group. These results suggest that certain genotypes of TTV may interfere with the improvement of liver function following the start of abstinence in ALD patients. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - A new group of transmissible single-stranded (ss) DNA viruses (SENV) distantly related to the large TT virus (TTV) family was recently identified. Eight different SENV isolates have been found, some with an association with posttransfusion hepatitis. A phylogenetic analysis of near-complete open-reading frame 1, including conserved motifs and excluding recombinant regions, was performed. The analysis used TTV-like minivirus as an outgroup, to determine a root of the phylogenetic tree, and compared 8 SENV isolates, 6 prototype TTV isolates, and 7 TTV variants (including SANBAN, TUS01, PMV, and YONBAN). Four distinct clusters separated by a bootstrap value of 100% were observed. YONBAN isolates formed a distinct outer group, representing the earliest recognized phylogenetic divergence (group 1). Prototype TTV formed group 2, PMV formed group 3, and SENV, SANBAN, and TUS01 isolates formed group 4, the most recently evolved group. This taxonomic classification suggests that these circular ssDNA viruses probably evolved from a common ancestor virus.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a human circovirus with a single-stranded, circular DNA genome of 3.8 kb. A method was developed to detect IgM antibodies to TTV as a serological marker for the diagnosis of acute TTV infection. IgM antibodies in test sera were captured by a monoclonal antibody against IgM/μ on a solid support followed by binding of IgM with TTV derived from fecal extract of a TTV carrier. The presence of IgM-specific TTV particles was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using nucleic acids extracted from the solid support. Anti-TTV IgM was detected in sera from two patients with non-A to G post-transfusion hepatitis, who were positive for TTV DNA during weeks 10-21 and 12-17, respectively, following transfusion. The anti-TTV IgM was detectable after alanine transaminase levels were elevated and TTV DNA was detectable in the patients. The duration of the anti-TTV IgM was short-lived compared with anti-TTV IgG. Anti-TTV IgM was not detected in sera from any of 36 healthy individuals, with no detectable anti-TTV IgG or TTV DNA in their serum. These results indicate that anti-TTV IgM antibodies would be a useful marker to detect acute TTV infection. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Following the development of tests for hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus infection, it became clear that there remained cases of hepatitis that were non-A-E. Such cases provided impetus for the search for additional hepatitis viruses and, by using molecular techniques, several candidates were identified. An enteric agent responsible for sporadic non-A and non-E hepatitis was tentatively called hepatitis F virus. However, the lack of any corroborating reports has cast doubt on its status as a true hepatitis virus. Two groups independently reported the isolation of a blood-borne virus, designated as hepatitis G virus (HGV) and GB virus C (GBV-C) by their respective discoverers. They were later shown to be isolates of the same virus. While the virus has a high prevalence in cases of non-A-E hepatitis, it also has a high prevalence in the appropriate control groups and convincing evidence for its replication in the liver is lacking. Another possible hepatitis virus, TT virus, was discovered in the blood of a patient with post-transfusion non-A-E hepatitis. By using PCR primers designed to overcome the high nucleotide sequence divergence, TT virus was found to be ubiquitous with a worldwide distribution. A disease association is thus unlikely. Most recently, a DNA virus designated as SEN-V has been announced as a major cause of non-A-E hepatitis. Based on limited data available to researchers, SEN-V is the most convincing contender for the new hepatitis virus title. However, the lessons learnt from the hepatitis virus pretenders will need to be applied to SEN-V and any future contenders. © 2001 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - In multiply coinfected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients, we investigated the effects of high-activity antiretroviral therapy (HAART) using HIV protease inhibitors on three other viruses: hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis G virus (HGV), and TT virus (TTV). Viral concentrations were measured serially by polymerase chain reaction methods in five patients with quadruple infection (HIV, HCV, HGV, and TTV) and in two patients with triple infection (HIV, HCV, and HGV) before and during HAART. In addition, CD4+ cell counts and serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured serially. Generally we observed no difference in serum HCV RNA, HGV RNA, or TTV DNA concentrations between samples obtained before and after initiation of HAART, whereas HIV RNA concentration decreased and CD4 counts increased in most patients. However, two patients had markedly decreased concentrations of HCV RNA and HGV RNA, respectively, more than 12 months after beginning HAART. Normalization of serum ALT levels was observed in a patient with decline of HCV RNA concentrations. No interactions were observed among these four viruses. HAART had no apparent direct effects on HCV, HGV, or TTV. Further studies will be required to elucidate whether the restoration of immune status through suppression of HIV replication by HAART may affect HCV or HGV RNA concentrations.

AB  - The phylogenetic relationship between the complete genomic sequences of ten Japanese and one French isolate of TT virus-like mini virus (TLMV) was investigated. Analysis of the variability of the nucleotide sequences and the detection of signature patterns for overlapping genes suggested that ORFs 1 and 2 are probably functional. However, this was not the case for a putative third ORF, ORF3. Throughout the viral genome, several nucleotide or amino acid motifs that are conserved in circoviruses such as TT virus (TTV) and chicken anaemia virus were identified. Phylogenetic analysis distinguished three main groups of TLMV and allowed the identification of putative recombination breakpoints in the untranslated region. TLMV genomes were detected by PCR in the plasma of 38/50 French blood donors tested and were also identified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, faeces and saliva. A phylogenetic study of 37 TLMV strains originating from France, Japan and Brazil showed that groupings were not related to geographical origin.

AB  - A newly discovered DNA virus, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), was isolated from a post-transfusional hepatitis patient in Japan. A high prevalence (32-46%) of TTV infections in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis (HD) has been reported but the occupational risk of TTV on HD units has not yet been determined. We determined the prevalence of TTV in workers in the same HD unit and the risk factors for TTV infection in HD patients, using logistic regression analysis. The prevalence of TTV DNA was 59.6% in 198 HD patients, significantly higher than that in the HD unit (13 of 39, 33.3%; P = 0.002) and non-HD healthcare workers (20 of 75, 26.7%; P < 0.001). A logistic regression analysis showed that male gender and negative test results for hepatitis G virus RNA were risk factors for TTV infection, but prior blood transfusion and duration of HD were not. Stepwise selection of multiple regression analysis showed that the presence of hepatitis C virus RNA was the only significant predictor for high serum ALT activity, and that the presence of TTV DNA was not. These results indicate that TTV is one of the prevalent human viruses transmissible either parenterally or nonparenterally in HD patients, but the occupational risk of TTV infection in HD unit workers is as low as in other healthcare workers. The pathogenic effects of TTV on the liver appear to be limited. © 2001 The Hospital Infection Society.

AB  - SUMMARY. This study was aimed to evaluate TT virus prevalence in subjects with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in patients affected by hepatitis of unknown origin (non-A-non-E hepatitis) and in healthy subjects who had not been exposed to HBV, HCV and HIV. A total of 317 subjects were tested; 40 were HBsAg asymptomatic carriers, 57 subjects were anti-HCV positive (45 without chronic hepatitis and 12 with HCV-related chronic hepatitis), and 27 had chronic non-A-non-E hepatitis. Fifty-seven subjects were intravenous drug users (IVDUs) (52 with HCV or/and HIV infections), seven patients underwent a liver transplant for fulminant hepatitis and 137 were healthy subjects from the general population. Overall, TTV-DNA was detected in 62 subjects (19.6%): in 17.9% of the HBsAg carriers, in 14% of the anti-HCV-positive patients (in 8.3% and in 15.5% of patients with and without chronic hepatitis, respectively), in 22.2% of non-A-non-E hepatitis patients, in 22.8% of IVDUs, in 57.1% of fulminant hepatitis patients. TTV-DNA was also found in 20.4% healthy subjects. The prevalence in the different subgroups was not statistically different. The genotypes were identified in 40 of the 62 (64.5%) TTV-DNA positive samples: genotype 1a in 17.5%, 1b in 27.5%, genotype 2 in 27.5%, genotype 3 in 15.0%, genotype 4 in 5.0% and genotype 5 in 7.5%; the genotype distribution in the subsets of patients was not significantly different. In conclusion, this study showed that TTV infection is common in Italy; it is widespread throughout the entire population and five genotypes are present in Sardinia. Our results further dismiss the role of TTV as cofactor in influencing the clinical course of infections with other hepatitis viruses as well as the role of HIV in enhancing TTV transmission and replication.

AB  - Background and Aims: Much is still unknown about the clinical significance of TT virus (TTV), which has been reported as a candidate for non A-G hepatitis virus. The aim of this study was to clarify the clinical significance of TTV in patients coinfected with TTV and hepatitis C virus (HCV). Methods: The 95 subjects studied had chronic hepatitis C (CHC), and underwent interferon (IFN) therapy. TT Virus DNA was detected by using polymerase chain reaction. The nucleotide sequences were determined by using a dideoxy chain termination method. A phylogenetic tree was drawn up by using the neighbor-joining method. Results: TT Virus DNA was detected in 37.9% of patients with the use of an open reading frame 1 (ORF1) primer, and in 88.4% of patients by using a 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) primer. Using both sets of primers, no differences were found between TTV-DNA-positive and -negative subjects with CHC in the clinical findings. Serum TTV DNA was eradicated in 30.6% of patients with the ORF1 primer, and in 19.1% of patients with the 5′ UTR primer at 6 months after the cessation of IFN therapy. The levels of TTV DNA before IFN therapy were significantly lower in the viral eradication group than in non-eradication group. The changes in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations were significantly correlated with changes in HCV-RNA in CHC patients with TTV. Moreover, there was no correlation between the changes in TTV DNA and the course of ALT. Conclusion: Hepatocellular injury in patients with chronic hepatitis who are coinfected with HCV and TTV appears to primarily be caused by HCV and is less attributable to TTV. © 2001 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was cloned as a possible causative agent for non A to G posttransfusion hepatitis. Determination of the entire sequence of the virus revealed that the virus is the first human circovirus. The nucleotide sequence of TTV has a wide range of diversity and at least sixteen genotypes have been discovered to date. The prevalence of TTV infection in the normal population differs among countries, but exceeds 10 % in several countries. Most of TTV infections are not associated with hepatitis, although there is evidence of TTV-induced hepatitis, especially caused by TTV of genotype 1. To determine whether TTV is replicated in the liver is important in order to show that TTV is really hepatitis virus, because results of a study in bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients suggested that TTV might be replicated mainly in the hematopoietic cells. The prevalence of TTV infection in patients with hematological disorders who regularly require blood products was extremely high, but most of the infections did not cause liver injury, even in BMT recipients.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is not only an infectious agent of worldwide distribution but has also been demonstrated in various non-human primates in addition to humans. In the present study, we subjected the sera of 67 gibbons to PCR and nucleotide sequencing, with subsequent phylogenetic analysis to determine the nature of the relationship between TTV found in humans and non-human primates. We discovered the virus in 9/67 (13.4%) of the gibbon sera and subjected 6 of those to direct sequencing. The phylogenetic tree constructed encompassed all TTV species known to date, revealing a close proximity between the gibbon virus and those detected in Thai individuals, whereas the chimpanzee strains were phylogenetically more remote.

AB  - TT virus is a recently discovered virus, of which the pathogenetic potential is still uncertain. The present paper describes the histopathological features of a case of TT virus-related acute recurrent hepatitis. The patient is a 28-year-old woman with no history of drug or alcohol abuse, presenting with repeated episodes of hypertransaminasemia evidenced during the last 4 years. No other markers of viral or autoimmune disease were found. On histological analysis, the liver parenchyma showed a preserved architecture. The histological features were those of a mild acute hepatitis. The clinicopathological findings suggest that TT virus might be responsible for a mild form of liver disease.

AB  - The significance of TT virus (TTV) infection in the pathogenesis of acute liver disease is uncertain. Serum TTV-DNA was determined by polymarase-chain reaction (PCR) methods using both hemi-nested (NG059/NG063 and NG061/NG063) and single-step (T801/T935) primers in four patients with fulminant hepatic failure and one patient with late onset hepatic failure in whom hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) markers were negative. Of these five patients, the TTV-DNA was positive in two patients with fulminant hepatic failure by both PCRs before receiving blood transfusion and/or blood-products infusion. Therapies including plasma exchange with blood hemodiafiltration was performed in both patients, and one survived. The non-survivor was an 18-year-old woman with TTV genotype 2 infection. In this patient, the TTV-DNA by PCRs with both primers was positive transiently when serum ALT levels were elavated. The survivor was a 78-year-old woman with infections of TTV genotype 1b and hepatitis C virus (HCV), in whom serum ALT levels returned to normal at 3 weeks after the start of the therapies, but fluctuated after 10 weeks. TTV-DNA measured by hemi-nested primers and HCV-RNA were negative when serum ALT levels decreased, but became positive later. Semi-quantitative PCR using single-step primers revealed that serum TTV-DNA levels changed in correlation with both serum ALT and HCV-RNA levels. Amino acid sequences of hypervariable regions were identical in six out of nine clones isolated from the sera before the therapies and sequence divergence was minimal even in the other three clones, suggesting that TTV proliferated with clonality in the process of fulminant hepatic failure. We conclude that clonally proliferating TTV may contribute to fulminant hepatic failure as a solitary infectious agent or a co-infectious agent with HCV. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the tissue tropism of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), a novel nonenveloped DNA virus, in experimentally infected Rhesus monkey. METHODS: Filtrate of feces of one patient with TTV infection was fed into the stomachs of ten Rhesus monkeys. Five (?) monkeys were killed during viremia and their tissues were collected to be examined for the presence of replicative virus DNA by in situ hybridization, dot blot hybridization with antisense probe and hybridization/nuclease protection assay. RESULTS: The virus contents (density of electrophoretic band) in the liver, PBMC, and serum of three infected monkeys 50.1%, 31.0%, and 18.9% respectively; the relative proportion was 2.65;1.64;1.00. TTV was detected in liver, spleen, stomach, small intestine and its lymph nodes, PBMC, colon, and serum; however, viral plus-chain, a putative replicative intermediate, was found only in liver, spleen, small intestine, and lymphoid cells. CONCLUSION: Transfusion transmitted virus is hepato-, spleno-, and lymphoid cell-tropic, and may has multiple routes of transmission.

AB  - There is a strong association between 2 SEN virus (SENV) variants (SENV-D and SENV-H) and transfusion-associated non-A–E hepatitis. In total, 200 subjects from a Japanese region where hepatitis C virus (HCV) is highly endemic and 194 persons from a contiguous area where HCV is not endemic were tested for SENV-D and SENV-H DNA by polymerase chain reaction. SENV DNA was detected equally in subjects from each area (56% prevalence in the area of high endemicity vs. 61% in the nonendemic area). Age-specific prevalence of SENV was similar to that of TT virus, with equal distribution at all ages in both areas; HCV was predominant in the elderly population. Alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly associated with HCV viremia but not with SENV viremia. SENV is a common infection that appears to have transmission routes and age-related prevalence that are distinct from those of HCV. No evidence was found that SENV caused hepatitis or worsened the course of hepatitis C.

AB  - Non-enveloped TT virus (TTV), recognized in 1997, contains single-stranded circular DNA (about 3,800 nucleotides) and seems to be a member of Circinoviridae, a new family of hepatitis viruses. The data on the occurrence of TTV are highly controversial: 1-22% in blood donors, 20-40% in hematological patients, 15-35% in patients with liver diseases. The virus has been found to be transmitted by the oral-fecal route as it penetrates via bile into feces and is then excreted from the gastrointestinal tract. A relatively low percentage of the occurrence of TTV infection in groups of risk may be regarded as the evidence that sexual and injection routes are not the main route of its transmission. Further investigations are necessary to establish the regularities of the epidemiology of TTV, to obtain information on its pathogenicity and on the methods for diagnosing hepatitis caused by this virus.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered human virus with a single-stranded, circular DNA genome. The TTV DNA sequence includes two major open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1 and ORF2. Recently, spliced TTV mRNAs were detected and revealed two additional coding regions, ORF3 and ORF4. We found sequence similarity between the TTV ORF3 protein and hepatitis C virus (HCV) nonstructural 5A (NS5A) protein, which is a phosphoprotein and is thought to associate with various cellular proteins. To test whether the TTV ORF3 protein is phosphorylated, the state of phosphorylation was analyzed with a transient protein production system. The TTV ORF3 protein was phosphorylated at the serine residues in its C-terminal portion. Furthermore, the TTV ORF3 gene generated two forms of proteins with a different phosphorylation state, similar to the HCV NS5A region, suggesting that TTV ORF3 protein has function(s) similar to phosphorylated viral proteins such as the HCV NS5A protein. © 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - Background and Aim: It has been a conflicting issue whether TT virus (TTV), a newly isolated DNA virus from a patient with liver injury of unknown cause, is a causative agent of acute and/or chronic hepatitis. TT Virus DNA titers were shown to be 10-100-fold greater in liver tissue than in serum, whereas the majority of TTV-positive cases had no biochemical or histological evidence of significant liver damage. We therefore attempted in situ hybridization to investigate whether TTV is hepatotropic. Methods: Because of the marked divergence in TTV genome types, a template for TTV-DNA (coding region for N22 clone) was amplified and labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP by using hemi-nested PCR from the serum, then DNA probes were applied to the liver sections of the same case. After hybridization, the probes were visualized immunohistochemically. Besides TTV-DNA-negative cases, competitive inhibition experiments with unlabeled probes were performed to confirm the specificity. Results: There were no positive signals in the negative controls, and the intensity of positive signals was markedly diminished in the competitive inhibition experiments. No cross-hybridization with different genotype probes also confirms the specificity. Under the optimal conditions, the positive signals were located in the cytoplasm of the hepatocytes in eight of nine TTV-DNA-positive cases. The signals were not seen in non-parenchymal cells of the liver. Conclusion: TT Virus is proved to be hepatotropic byin situ hybridization. © 2001 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Background: A possible association between oral lichen planus (OLP) and chronic hepatic disease has been found in some populations, although this is probably geographically influenced. In 1997 a new hepatotropic virus, transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), was identified but has not been studied in relation to OLP. Objective: The present investigation evaluated the genoprevalence of TTV DNA in the sera of British and Italian patients suffering from OLP using two different sets of primers to identify TTV subgenomic DNA. Methods: Study groups comprised 40 adult subjects (21 British, 19 Italian) with OLP. For each country, two control groups, a disease-control group and a healthy-control group, were included. The presence of TTV DNA in the sera of patients and control subjects was assessed using two different polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis. Results: Statistical analysis did not reveal evidence of any association between TTV infection and OLP or country of residence. Conclusion: An association between TTV and OLP is unlikely.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently described circular DNA virus of about 3.8 kb, which is related to the circoviridae viruses. It is commonly detected in healthy subjects and no association with any specific disease has been established. TTV was initially thought to be hepatotropic, but subsequent reports have shown that it is detectable in other tissues, including kidney, prostate, mammary gland, brain, bone marrow, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Plasma samples from cancer patients and healthy subjects were tested for the presence or absence of TTV by heminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). We also developed a quantitative competitive PCR (QC-PCR) assay for TTV that permits accurate measurement of TTV DNA load. Using this assay, the TTV genome load in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of healthy control subjects (n = 50) and patients with various types of cancer (n = 148), including breast cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and other cancers, was measured. TTV DNA was detected in 69 of 100 plasma samples (69%) of cancer patients tested and in 39 of 100 plasma samples (39%) randomly selected from 1000 plasma samples of blood donors (p < 0.05). TTV DNA was detectable in the PBMCs of 99% of the cancer patients and 86% of the controls. However, the median virus load was more than 100-fold higher in the cancer patients (3599 copies/100,000 cells) than among the controls (30 copies/100,000 cells; p < 0.0001). There was no significant difference in TTV load among the different cancer types. Using a cutoff value of >250 copies per 100,000 PBMCs, 93.2% of cancer patients were "positive" compared to only 4% of healthy control subjects. Almost all the cancer patients have TTV infection and their TTV genome load in PBMCs is significantly higher than that in control subjects. It remains to be elucidated whether such findings are specific to cancer patients or occur in all seriously ill subjects.

AB  - Background: TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered human DNA virus with worldwide distribution, but with no clear disease association. The possibility of an enhanced TTV virulence in patients with immunodeficiencies has not yet been investigated but is of particular interest because other viruses have been demonstrated to cause severe and rapid liver disease in such patients. Here we analysed the characteristics of TTV infection in a large cohort of patients with primary hypogammaglobulinaemia (PHG) and whether TTV has a role in the frequently observed cryptogenic liver disease in these patients. Methods: 83 Norwegian patients with PHG (serum immunoglobulin G < 2 g/L), receiving substitution treatment with immunoglobulins, were followed regularly for median 10.2 years (range 2-30). TTV DNA was sought in serum samples and three immunoglobulin preparations by polymerase chain reaction; TTV DNA quantitation, DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed in selected samples. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 27 of 83 (32.5%) patients and was not associated with a particular type of PHG. The prevalence of TTV infection was dependent on intravenous immunoglobulin administration, duration of therapy and patient's age. TTV DNA was found in two of three currently used immunoglobulin preparations. In the longitudinal study, whether TTV was cleared or newly acquired had no impact on liver function tests and no particular TTV strain was found in patients with more severe liver disease. Conclusions: TTV infection is common in patients with PHG. Treatment with immunoglobulins has a role in the transmission of TTV in these patients. However, we found no evidence of TTV-induced liver disease in this group of immunocompromised patients.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a novel single-stranded DNA virus that was identified in patients with post-transfusion-hepatitis of non-A-G type in Japan in 1997. We developed a new detection and typing method for TTV DNA strains, by combining polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) techniques. TTV DNA was amplified by nested-PCR with TTV-specific mixed primers derived from the conserved open reading frame 1 (ORF1) region of the published TTV DNA sequences. Using the enzymes HaeIII, DraI, EcoRI and PstI, we were able to distinguish between the four TTV genotypes. In 200 serum samples obtained from healthy pregnant women at an outpatient clinic, the positive rate of TTV detection was 27.0%, almost identical to the positive rate of the detection of ORF1-PCR in Japanese healthy individuals. The strains detected in the positive serum samples were genotype 1a (9.3%), genotype 1b (11.1%), genotype 2 (51.9%), genotype 3 (7.4%) and other genotypes (1.9%). This results indicate that genotype 1 and genotype 2 were the two major strains in the Japanese population. Moreover, 10 serum samples (18.5%) presented RFLP patterns in which some genotypes were mixed. © 2001 Academic Press.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly described nonenveloped human virus, with a circular, negative-stranded DNA genome, that was first identified in the blood of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. PCR primers and conditions used for TTV DNA amplification may greatly influence the level of TTV detection in serum. Three PCR assays, with different regions of the genome as targets, were used to test TTV DNA in 130 sera from children and adults visiting a hospital in the south of Brazil, most of them for routine procedure. Forty-four percent of adult sera and 73% of sera from children aged 0-10 years were TTVpositive with at least one PCR assay. However, the three assays were able to detect only 33%, 35%, and 70% of the total positive samples. Our results showed a high prevalence of TTV infection in the south of Brazil, particularly among young children, and confirmed the necessity of performing several PCR assays to assess the true TTV prevalence in a determined population.

AB  - The prevalence and genotype distribution of human TT virus (TTV) in Italy were analysed in 593 subjects at different risk of parenteral infection who included blood donors, patients with chronic type C hepatitis (HCV), thalassemic patients, patients on haemodialysis, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-negative intravenous drug users (IVDUs), and HIV-1-infected subjects (IVDUs, heterosexual contacts and homosexual males). Plasma TTV-DNA was detected using nested PCR with primers deduced from the N22 region of the open reading frame 1 (ORF-1) and from the untranslated region (UTR) of the viral genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the sequences obtained from ORF-1 was also undertaken. A high prevalence of plasma TTV-DNA was observed using the UTR primers, with rates varying from 83-100% in the study groups. Using the N22 primers, HIV-1 positive IVDUs and homosexual males, haemodialysed patients and thalassemic patients had a significantly higher TTV prevalence (range: 23.0-86.1%) than blood donors, who displayed a high frequency of positivity (10.6%). Sequence analysis of 127 N22-positive isolates revealed that 42.5% were of type 1, 53.5% of type 2, 2.4% of type 3, and that two isolates (1.6%) were closely related to genotypes 1-2 but distinct from the other major genotypes. TTV-2 was significantly more prevalent in patients at high risk for parenteral infection and in HIV-1 positive homosexuals. In sequential samples from 15 TTV-infected subjects, N22 sequences were detectable persistently in 12 (80.0%) and UTR sequences persisted in all 15 patients over a mean period of 29.6 months. This data indicates that TTV is widespread in Italy in parenterally exposed subjects, and that the infection frequently persists. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was recovered from the sera of tupaias (Tupaia belangeri chinensis) by PCR using primers derived from the noncoding region of the human TTV genome, and its entire genomic sequence was determined. One tupaia TTV isolate (Tbc-TTV14) consisted of only 2199 nucleotides (nt) and had three open reading frames (ORFs), spanning 1506 nt (ORF1), 177 nt (ORF2) and 642 nt (ORF3), which were in the same orientation as the ORFs of the human prototype TTV (TA278). ORF3 was presumed to arise from a splicing of TTV mRNA, similar to reported human TTVs whose spliced mRNAs have been identified, and encoded a joint protein of 214 amino acids with a Ser-, Lys- and Arg-rich sequence at the C terminus. Tbc-TTV14 was less than 50% similar to previously reported TTVs of 3.4-3.9 kb and TTV-like mini viruses (TLMVs) of 2.8-3.0 kb isolated from humans and non-human primates, and known animal circoviruses. Although Tbc-TTV14 has a genomic length similar to animal circoviruses (1.8-2.3 kb), Tbc-TTV14 resembled TTVs and TLMVs with regard to putative genomic organization and transcription profile. Conserved motifs were commonly observed in the coding and noncoding regions of the Tbc-TTV14 genome and in all TTV and TLMV genomes. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Tbc-TTV14 is the closest to TLMVs, and is closer to TTVs isolated from tamarin and douroucouli than to TTVs isolated from humans and chimpanzees. These results indicate that tupaias are naturally infected with a new TTV species that has not been identified among primates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the perinatal infection of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in the mother-to-infant transmission and molecular evidence. METHODS: TTV was examined in serum from 104 mothers and umbilical blood of their infants by a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction technique. TTV nucleotide sequences isolated from two sets of mother/infant pairs were analyzed. RESULTS: The TTV detection rate was 13.46% (15/104), and it was 4.81% (5/104) in the umbilical blood of their newborns. Homology analysis was done by sequencing between positions 1,915 and 2,185 of the published TTV genome, Analysis of TTV sequences from the 2 pairs of mother and infant both infected confirmed a genetic link between the virus of the infected mother and their infected infants. CONCLUSIONS: There is a possibility of vertical maternal-fetal transmission of TTV.

AB  - The precipitating factors of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) have not been elucidated. Recently, a novel DNA virus named TTvirus (TTV) was discovered in a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. TTV is a circular, single-stranded DNA virus of 3.8 kB. To evaluate the relationship between TTV and IPF, the sera of 33 patients with IPF were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in 12 (36.4%) IPF patients. The serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was significantly higher in the IPF patients with TTV than in those without TTV (802 ± 121 vs. 530 ± 49 IUI-1, P &lt; 0.05). Six (50%) of 12 patients in the TTV DNA-positive group died during the observation period, while only six (28.6%) of 21 patients in the TTV DNA-negative group died. The 3-year-survival rate was significantly lower in the TTV DNA-positive group than in the TTV DNA-negative group (58.3% vs. 95.2%, P &lt; 0.02). Replicative intermediate forms of TTV DNA were detected in the lung specimen from a TTV-infected IPF patient. TTV infection influences the disease activity and prognosis of IPF in some cases. Further studies are required to elucidate the clinical significance of TTV in IPF. © 2001 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between TT virus (TTV) infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: TTV was examined in sera of 112 patients with HCC and 95 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) without HCC. 30 patients without liver disease were examined as control. TTV DNA was detected by the second generation of TTV PCR primers (NG059, NG061 and NG063) after extraction of DNA from 50 microliters serum. The relationship between TTV infection and clinical features of each group patients was analyzed. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 17.86% (20/112) of HCC patients, and this prevalence in HCC patients was not significantly higher than that of TTV DNA in CLD patients (15.78%, 15/95). There were no significant differences in age, gender, tumor factors (size, TNM classification and markers) and other hepatitis virus markers between TTV-positive and TTV-negative in HCC and CLD patients, except history of blood transfusion [(80.00% vs 35.87% (P < 0.05) in HCC patients and 73.33% vs 27.50% (P < 0.05) in CLD patients)] and ALT [(93 +/- 27) IU/L vs (68 +/- 31) IU/L (P < 0.05) in HCC patients]. It seemed that TTV did not do any harm to the liver function of patients who infected with HBV or HCV, except for elevating ALT level in such a kind of HCC patients. CONCLUSION: Although TTV could do harm to the liver function of HCC patients, it does not contribute to the development of HCC from CLD.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a widespread infectious agent of humans identified in 1998. In infected individuals, TTV induces persistent viremia but its life cycle and pathogenic potential are still poorly understood. In the present study, the presence of TTV DNA in 32 consecutive paired serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples from patients with neurological (mainly multiple sclerosis) disorders was investigated by means of a sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assay. Of the 24 patients who were found to carry TTV DNA in serum, 3 also had detectable TTV DNA in their CSF. Two TTV positive CSF samples had markers indicative of blood contamination or a disrupted blood-brain barrier and contained considerably lower TTV loads as compared with the corresponding serum samples, thus suggesting that the virus they contained was of plasma origin. These findings indicated that in general TTV does not permeate effectively an intact blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the CNS does not represent a common site of TTV replication and persistence. However, at least one exception was observed: the third TTV positive CSF sample (obtained from a patient with subacute dementia of unknown origin) showed no markers suggestive of disrupted blood-brain barrier or blood contamination and had a TTV DNA concentration similar to that found in the patient's serum. In addition, the TTV isolates detected in the two body fluids were distinct genetically. The detection of TTV DNA in CSF is of considerable interest but the clinical significance remains unknown. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Clinical characteristics of transmitted transfusion virus (TTV) infection and its pathogenicity in children were evaluated. Serum TTV DNA from 118 children (mean age: 7. 8 ± 2. 8 years) was detected by nested PCR. The product of PCR was cloned and sequenced. The positive rate for serum TTV-DNA in 20 healthy children, 9 cases of acute hepatitis, 51 cases of chronic hepatitis, 24 cases of nephritis or nephrotic syndrome and 14 cases of hypoplastic anemia or acute leukemia was 20%, 11%, 29%, 42% and 21% respectively, but there was no significant difference in TTV-DNA frequency among them (P>0. 05). Of the 16 patients receiving immunosuppressive agent for a long time, 7 (44%) were positive for TTV-DNA, and of the 17 cases not receiving immunosuppressive agent, 5 (29%) were positive with the difference being not significant (P>0. 05). Essential characteristics were pathogen-carrier or asymtomatic infection in children with TTV infection. Long-term employment of immunosuppressive agent did not increase the incidence in TTV infection. There was still high prevalence in TTV infection in healthy children not receiving blood product, suggesting the possibility of non hematogenous transmitted transfusion in TTV transmission.

AB  - A 10-year-old girl with thalassemia underwent bone marrow transplantation. Before transplantation, she had persistent TT virus (TTV) DNAemia for at least 18 months. Interestingly, the viral DNAemia was cleared soon after transplant and remained undetectable at the latest follow-up at 28 months. The early clearance of TTV that had occurred before engraftment or initiation of any antiviral therapy, together with the absence of TTV DNA from the results of the liver biopsy performed before transplantation, led us to hypothesize that the hematologic compartment could have been the site for viral persistence. Thus, the conditioning regimen may have depleted the hemic cells and the hematologically compartmentalized TTV. The potential of hemic tropism of TTV and its role in hematologic diseases need to be considered. © 2001 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A high prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection has been found in patients who received blood or blood components. Viral DNA was demonstrated in commercial preparations of FVIII and FIX, but very few data have been reported on immunoglobulins. The risk of TTV infection associated with intramuscular or IV immunoglobulin administration is unclear. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The prevalence of TTV infection in a group of patients undergoing lifelong therapy because of congenital immunodeficiency has been evaluated in a long term follow-up (median, 6 years). Seventeen patients with congenital immunodeficiency receiving monthly administration of IVIG were included in the study. TTV DNA was repeatedly evaluated by PCR in serum samples from each patient during the follow-up. Research of antibodies against TTV was not applicable, as the patients studied were unable to produce antibodies. The presence of TTV was also evaluated in 15 IVIG lots. RESULTS: The total amount of immunoglobulin administered was 18,773g. TTV infection was not found in any patients included in the study. None of the 15 immunoglobulin preparations analyzed was found positive for TTV DNA. CONCLUSION: Despite the high prevalence of TTV in blood donors, commercial immunoglobulins are safe and unable to transmit TTV.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the frequency, the routes of transmission from mother to infant, the correlation factors and distribution of genotypes of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection. METHODS: Nested-polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) was performed to detect TTV DNA and genotypes in serums and breast milks from 160 cases of pregnant women. RESULTS: TTV DNA in serum and breast milk was detected in 64 (40.0%) and 60 (37.5%) of 160 cases of pregnant women respectively. The positive rates of TTV DNA from HBV markers (+) and normal groups were 50.0%, 43.1% and 13.6%, 22.7% respectively in serums and breast milk. There were significant difference between the two groups (P < 0.05). The TTV genotypes were type I in all 124 samples of TTV DNA detected. CONCLUSIONS: TTV infection is common in the pregnant women and a high prevalence of TTV infection in pregnant women with positive HBV markers has been demonstrated. TTV infection is correlated with HBV. TTV is probably transmitted from mother to their children by breast feeding. All of TTV genotypes detected in pregnant women is genotype I.

METHODS: Serum, breast milk from 150 pregnant women and umbilical venous blood from their newborns were collected. TTV DNA was amplified by semi-nested-polymerase chain reaction, and the positive products were sequenced directly. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV DNA in pregnancy serum was 11.3% (17/150). Among the 17 serum positive cases, TTV DNA was detected in 11 breast milk samples, and none in all the umbilical blood. The homologous of partial nucleotide sequence of TTV DNA between the 3 serum samples and their breast milk were 97.6%-99.2%. Compared the 5 serum positive samples (A1-A5) with N22 segments of Japanese original isolate, the homologous of partial nucleotide and amino acid sequence were 71.5%-92.8%, 71.5%-92.8%, respectively. CONCLUSION: There exists TTV infection in pregnancy serum and breast milk. Transmission by breast feeding may be one of the main pathway causing TTV infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the genotypes of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) in South China. METHODS: One capture probe for all types of TTV from the conserved sequence nt2160 to nt2196 and six varied probes, heterogeneity more than 20% between each other for G1, G2, G3, G4, G5 and G6 type, respectively were synthesized. The primers coming from the conserved sequence of ORF1 were used to amplify TTV DNA from the serums of patients. Microplate sandwich hybridization-ELISA technique was used to detect the genotypes of TTV in 380 hepatitis patients with liver damage. RESULTS: Sixty-one of 380 patients, about 16.0%, were TTV DNA positive, in whom 44 were genotype I (G1), 5 were G2, 10 were mixed infection of G1 and G2, one was G3 and one was G4. Neither G5 nor G6 has been detected. The rate of TTV infection in chronic hepatitis patients was equal to that in acute hepatitis patients. CONCLUSIONS: TTV infection is common in South China. There are four types of TTV. The first genotype was G1, and the second was G2. G5 or G6 has not yet been detected. PCR microplate sandwich hybridization-ELISA has certain value in clinic diagnosis for its specific, sensitive and practicable characters.

AB  - Background: TTV is a new DNA virus distinguished by its high degree of strain heterogeneity. The geographic clustering of viral genotypes suggests frequent community transmission. While no specific human disease has yet been linked to it, a transmission mechanism that facilitates strain diversity may eventually select for a strain that will become pathogenic. Objective: This study was performed to examine the prevalence, genotypic distribution, and mode of transmission of TTV in detail. Study design: Three groups of study subjects were recruited between October 1998 and January 2000 in Prague, Czech Republic. Group 1 included 152 injection drug users with liver disease; group 2 included 102 persons with liver disease who denied ever using injection drugs; group 3 included 111 prospective blood donors. TTV DNA was detected from blood by a semi-nested PCR assay, and a selected set of PCR products was genotyped by direct sequencing. Factors associated with TTV prevalence in groups 1 and 2 subjects were compared. Results: TTV was detected in 15.8, 13.7, and 13.5% of Groups 1, 2, and 3 subjects, respectively (P>0.05). The most common genotype was 2 (54%), followed by 1 (13%). The prevalence of TTV viremia was nearly three times higher in persons with a present or past history of hepatitis B compared to those without (P<0.05). TTV prevalence increased proportionately with the number of lifetime sex partners in both groups (P<0.05); it was highest (32%) among non-users of injection drugs who had five or more lifetime sex partners. Conclusion: TTV prevalence in the Czech population is similar among blood donors, persons with liver disease, as well as in a high-risk population of injection drug users. TTV appears to be sexually transmitted. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) replicates in the liver and to analyze the relationship between TTV and cryptogenic hepatitis. METHODS: A 3.2 kb TTV fragment was detected by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 31 serum samples of patients with cryptogenic hepatitis who came from a school where was in an outbreak area of cryptogenic hepatitis during 1996 and in 30 healthy individuals. A hybridization/nuclease protection assay was used to detect positive-strand TTV fragment from the liver specimens of the 7 patients. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in serum samples from 30 of 31 (96.9%) patients and from 18 of 30 (60%) healthy individuals, respectively. There was significant difference in the prevalence of TTV infection between the two groups. Based on hybridization/ nuclease protection assays, we detected positive-strand TTV fragment in all of 7 liver specimens of the patients. CONCLUSIONS: TTV is related possibly to cryptogenic hepatitis. TTV can replicate in the liver. Although TTV only causes mild liver damage, a few patients will suffer from chronic hepatitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) genotype in hepatitis patients and healthy people. METHODS: DNA fragment of TTV was amplified by polymerase chain reaction with nested primers in eight patients with liver disease and three healthy persons. The nested PCR products were cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: A TTV DNA sequence of 222 bp (primer sequence excluded) was compared among the 11 subjects. The similarity between N22 and WH1, WH2, WH3, GZ1, GZ2, GZ3, SD2, SD3 was 97.0%, 97.0%, 98.0%, 98.0%, 95.0%, 95.0%, 94.6% and 95.5%, respectively. The similarity between TXO11 and GZ4, SD1, XJ1 was 98.0%, 98.0% and 95.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION: According to Okamoto's method, the eleven TTV clones are classified into two subtypes: genotype 1a and 1b.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study its pathogenecity based on infection status and replication of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in the liver tissues. METHODS: Using recombinant plasmid as template and symmetrical and asymmetrical polymerase chain reaction (PCR), double-strand and single-strand TTV probes were labeled with digoxigenin. Fifty-six cases of liver biopsy specimens were detected by in situ hybridization, and six positive cases of them were tested further with single-strand probes. RESULTS: TTV DNA was found in 14 of 51 patients with non A and non G hepatitis (27.5%), and five cases in the control group were negative. TTV DNA was mainly observed in the nuclei of hepatocytes and pathologic changes and necrosis in the infected liver cells were not so apparent, but they could be seen in the liver tissues of acute, chronic and severe hepatitis, as well as of liver cirrhosis. TTV genome strand hybridization detected by single-strand probe was consistent with that by double-strand probe. Both TTV genome strand and its complementary strand were present in the two cases of liver specimens, but hybridizational signals were weaker in the latter than those in the former. CONCLUSION: TTV could cause injury and replicate itself in the liver, but no obvious and direct injury to hepatocytes.

AB  - Objective: The TT virus (TTV) was detected for the first time by Nishizawa and Okamoto et al. in 1997 in the serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown origin (non-A-non-G type). TTV was subsequently, also found in the serum of blood donors with no history of blood transfusion, although at a lower rate than among donors with a history of blood transfusion. In the present study, we determined the percentage of TTV carriers among pregnant women with no history of blood transfusion, and evaluated the possibility of mother-child transmission. Methods: Blood was sampled from 300 normal pregnant women with no history of blood transfusion, 10 infants born by vaginal delivery from TTV-positive women, 10 infants born by abdominal cesarean section from TTV-positive women at both 5 days and 3 months after birth, and 10 infants born from TTV-positive women at 6 months after birth. Amniotic fluid and breast milk were sampled from 10 and 30 TTV-positive women, respectively. Informed consent was obtained from all women before sampling. TTV DNA was detected by the nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. Results: (1) Of the 300 normal pregnant women with no history of blood transfusion, 60 (20%) were TTV-positive. (2) All infants from TTV-positive mothers were TTV-negative at both 5 days and 3 months after birth, regardless of whether they were born by vaginal delivery or abdominal cesarean section. (3) Of the 10 infants who were born from TTV-positive mothers and examined 6 months after birth, 4 (40%) were TTV-positive. (4) Amniotic fluid from all 10 TTV-positive women was TTV-negative. (5) Breast milk from 7 (23.3%) of the 30 TTV-positive women was TTV-positive. Conclusion: TTV was detected in 20% of pregnant women with no history of blood transfusion, suggesting that TTV infection can occur through non- blood-mediated routes. The possibility of transfer of TTV into amniotic fluid was ruled out due to its absence in amniotic fluid samples. All infants from TTV-positive women were TTV-negative at both 5 days and 3 months after birth, regardless of whether they were born by vaginal delivery or abdominal cesarean section, suggesting that infection in the parturient canal or the pelvis is unlikely. Because TTV was detected in breast milk from TTV-positive women and some of their infants were TTV-positive, breast milk was thought to be a mother-child infection route. These findings suggest that horizontal infection is more likely than vertical infection in mother-child transmission of TTV. © 2001 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish the EIA method for detection of antibody to TT virus (anti-TTV) and to investigate the distribution of anti-TTV in patients with hepatitis and in healthy people. METHODS: The ELISA method using the recombinant expressed product of truncated gene of TTV ORF1 as antigen was developed and was applied to detect anti-TTV in patients with hepatitis and in healthy control. The TTV DNA were detected by nested-PCR. RESULTS: The positive rates of anti-TTV antibodies in different populations were as follows: 1.3% in healthy people, 10.5% in patients with hepatitis A, 12.5% in patients with hepatitis B, 8.3% in patients with hepatitis C, 7.7% in patients with hepatitis D, 12.0% in patients with hepatitis E, 6.5% in patients with hepatitis G, 32.3% in patients with hepatitis non-A to G. The positive rate of TTV DNA was significantly related to that of anti-TTV (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: The anti-TTV antibodies were detected positive in patients with hepatitis and healthy people, however, its positive rate in patients with hepatitis non-A to G was significantly higher than that in other groups. The fact that anti-TTV antibodies coexist with TTV DNA suggests that the antibody to TTV ORF1 antigen may be an infectious marker of TTV similar to that of anti-HCV.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the location and distribution of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) in the liver and extrahepatic tissues. METHODS: TTV DNA was detected in paraffin-embedded autopsy liver and extrahepatic tissues, including liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, testicle, and heart from 13 patients with non A-G hepatitis by nested-PCR and in situ hybridization (ISH) techniques. RESULTS: Positive hybridization signals of TTV nucleus acid were observed in 5 liver, 3 kidney, 2 pancreas and spleen tissues, respectively. TTV DNA was detected in one from each two samples of testicle and heart. Positive signal was mainly located in nucleoli of the liver and extrahepatic parenchymal cells. There was not obvious pathological damage in those extrahepatic tissues. The positive rate of PCR approximately corresponded to ISH. CONCLUSIONS: TTV can infect hepatic and extrahepatic tissues and its infection in extrahepatic tissues might be responsible for a state of reinfection and higher prevalence in different population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of TTV genomes in young children from Nanjing and establish the PCR method for detecting TTV DNA. METHODS: A hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was established to detect TTV DNA in 110 young children and two PCR-amplified products were sequenced and the data were analyzed with the computer programs. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 14 out of 110 children, and 222 bp sequences of 2 isolates from the children were analyzed. Compared with representative of published isolates, they have the nucleotide identity of 93.7%-98.6% with TX011. CONCLUSIONS: The infection rate of TTV in children is 12.73%, and 2 isolates from children belong to subgroup G1b. Our results indicates that TTV could be transmitted via other pathway besides hematogenous one, and TTV could be carried by healthy population.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the existence of TT virus(transfusion-transmitted virus, TTV) in liver tissues of patients with unknown etiology. METHODS: Paraffin-embedded liver tissues from 51 cases who were non A-E hepatitis serologically and immunohistochemically negative for HBsAg, HCV NS3 antigen and HGV NS5 antigen were tested by in situ hybridization with Dig TTV DNA probe. RESULTS: The total positive rate of TTV DNA was 27.5% (14/51). Among the different pathological types, the positive rates were 30.8% (4/13) in acute mild hepatitis, 12.5% (1/8) in acute fulminante hepatitis, 42.9% (3/7) in subacute fulminante hepatitis, 33.3% (2/6) in chronic hepatitis, 22.2% (2/9) in active liver cirrhosis, 25% (1/4) in chronic fulminante hepatitis and 25% (1/4) in primary liver carcinoma respectively. Hybridization signals were detected within the nuclei or cytoplasm of the hepatocyte and most of them in nuclei. The positive cells were diffusely scattered in the intralobular areas in acute hepatitis and aggregated in periportal areas in chronic hepatitis or in the form of clustering in pseudolobules in active liver cirrhosis. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the TTV detected from liver tissues or sera from patients with unknown etiology is a novel virus, which belongs to hepadnavirus.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the prevalence of TT virus(TTV) in a variety of populations in China. METHODS: TTV DNA and anti TTV IgG were simultaneously tested by PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV DNA in the samples of 81 normal subjects, 92 blood donors, 123 hepatitis A-G patients and 32 hepatitis non A-G patients were 2.5%, 2.2%, 19.5% and 28.1%, respectively; and anti-TTV IgG was 1.2%, 3.7%, 26.8% and 34.4%, respectively. There were significant differences between the normal and the blood donor group and the hepatitis group; and among multi-infectious cases, the infection rate of TTV with HBV was as high as 75.0%. CONCLUSION: The investigation indicated that TTV infection was very popular in different groups. Some of the normal and blood donor groups infected with TTV could become healthy carries of virus. And the hepatitis patients were the high risk group. In addition, TTV may be transmitted via other pathways besides blood.

AB  - Background: Viral replication in blood cells with nucleuses may lead to the damage of lymphocytes genetic apparatus and the beginning of immunopathological reactions. Aim: Of this investigation is to reveal the damage to peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) DNA in the patients with chronic liver diseases. Materials and methods: Sixteen-nine patients with chronic liver diseases (37 patients with chronic viral hepatitis, 2 patients with liver cirrhosis of mixed etiology (alcohol + virus G), 30 women with primary biliary cirrhosis-PBC) were examined. The condition of DNA structure of PBL was measured by the fluorescence analysis of DNA unwinding (FADU) technique with modification. Changes of fluorescence (in %) reflected the DNA distractions degree (the presence of DNA single-stranded breaks and alkalinelabile sights). Results and conclusion: The quantity of DNA single-stranded breaks and alkalinelabile sights in DNA in all patients with chronic viral hepatitis didn't differ from the control group, excluding the patients with chronic hepatitis (CH) C + G. Patients with HGV and TTV monoinfection had demonstrated the increase of the DNA single-stranded breaks PBL quantity. This fact may be connected with hypothesis about the viruses replication in white blood cells discussed in the literature. Tendency to increase quantity of DNA PBL damages in the patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) accordingly to the alkaline phosphatase activity increase was revealed. Significant decrease of the DNA single-stranded breaks and alkalinelabile sights in the PBC patients that were treated with prednison was demonstrated. Probably, the tendency to increase the quantity of DNA single-stranded breaks and alkalinelabile sights in lymphocytes of the PBC patients was depended on the surplus of the blood bile acid content.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the prevalence of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) and its sequence characterization in China. METHODS: TTV DNA was amplified by Semi-Nested-PCR, and the positive products were sequenced directly. RESULTS: The homology of partial nucleotide and amino acid sequences of 7 Chinese TTV isolates were 64.7%-98.4% and 62.7%-96.4% respectively when compared with Japanese isolate. Among 7 Chinese TTV isolates, the homology of partial nucleotide and amino acid sequences were 63.5%-98.4% and 60.2%-96.4% respectively. They differently belong to two genotypes and two subgenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: There exists TTV in China, and there might be several genotypes of Chinese TTV isolates.

AB  - Infants born to serum HCV-positive 12 mothers were enrolled in the study. Nucleotide sequences amplified by primers deduced from a noncoding region were compared between mothers and their infants. The rates for detection of serum TTV in 12 mothers and their infants were 10/12 (83%) and 9/12 (75%), respectively. Serum TTV DNA was not detected in any infant at 1 month of age, but was detected for the first time between 1.5 and 8 months after birth. Positivity persisted thereafter throughout the follow-up period. In seven randomly selected mother-infant pairs, intrahost TTV heterogeneity was lower in infants than in mothers. Furthermore, one of seven mother-infant pairs showed a high degree of similarity (98.7-100%) in all clones, while in four infants, all nucleotide sequences differed by >10% from those of their mothers. However, the degree of homology in the two mother-infant pairs was 89-98.7% in family 2 and 88.1-99.4% in family 5. In the present study, with only one exception, it was shown that TTV from infants is not identical to TTV from mothers. The mechanism is discussed briefly in this paper. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To improve the amplification of non-specificity of TTV DNA detection using PCR from high background nuclear acids because of its low level in samples. METHODS: Specific nuclear acid captured PCR(SNAC-PCR) was established through capturing TTV DNA onto microplate with specific nuclear acid by means of avidin-biotin system, then amplifying captured TTV DNA as usual. Its specificity was evaluated by comparing with the detection of routine extraction samples using nested-PCR with or without subsequent DNA sequencing in 10 samples of sera and liver tissues in pairs. RESULTS: Positive results were obtained using routine protocol in 4 and 9 out of 10 samples of the sera and the liver tissues respectively. The PCR products were proved to be specific using RFLP analysis with Kpn I. However, positive results were found in only 2/10 and 3/10 of samples of sera and liver tissue using DNA sequencing. The results of SNAC-PCR were the same as those of routine protocol with subsequent DNA sequencing. Furthermore, sharper electrophoresis bands were obtained. CONCLUSION: SNAC-PCR could dramatically increase the specificity of the detection of TTV DNA, especially in high background nuclear acid samples. It can be widely used in the detection of other pathogens with low seral level or in high background nuclear acid samples. The level of TTV infection might be over-evaluated by currently used TTV DNA detection when the PCR products were not confirmed by DNA sequencing.

AB  - This study was undertaken to detect TTV DNA in serum samples from patients with non-A, non-B, non-C, non-E, and non-G (non-A-G) liver diseases and from blood donors, and to investigate the clinicopathological features of TTV infection including its prevalence and influence on liver disease. The study population consisted of 20 patients with non-A-G liver diseases (nine with chronic hepatitis (CH), six with liver cirrhosis (LC), and five with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as 47 blood donors. Detection of TTV DNA was conducted with 200 μl of serum by the nested polymerase chain reaction. The detection rate of TTV DNA by subject category was CH 55.9; LC 66.7; HCC 60%; and blood donors 28%. Regarding blood biochemistry, TTV DNA-positive patients tended to show higher levels of aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, as well as lower levels of platelet counts. Long-term follow-up revealed that TTV DNA-positive patients exhibited characteristic, multiple peaks of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels. The histologic findings in the livers of TTV DNA-positive patients with CH consisted of moderate necro-inflammatory reactions. In conclusion, it is possible that the TTV genotype 1b infection caused liver injury. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A new DNA virus, which has been designated the TT virus, was discovered in 1997. It is not clear whether TT virus is a cause of any of the types of hepatitis. We conducted a case-control study to test the hypothesis that the presence of TT virus is a necessary condition for the development of fulminant hepatic failure in people who have non-A, -B, or -C hepatitis. METHODS: We studied 55 patients with fulminant hepatic failure [28 men, 27 women, mean (± SD) age, 47 ± 15 yr], 32 patients with acute hepatitis (18 men, 14 women, mean age, 38 ± 15 yr), and 200 healthy subjects (106 men, 94 women, mean age, 42 ± 14 yr). TT virus DNA was detected in sera by a nested polymerase chain reaction using a primer set for genotype 1. RESULTS: TT virus was more frequently detected in patients with fulminant hepatic failure [in 33 of 55 (60%); 95% confidence interval (CI), 47-73%] than in those with acute hepatitis [in 8 of 32 (25%); 95% CI, 10-40%; p = 0.0016] or in healthy subjects [in 50 of 200 (25%); 95% CI, 19-31%; p < 0.0001]. TT virus was detected at a significantly higher rate in non-A, -B, or -C fulminant hepatic failure [in 18 of 22 (82%); 95% CI, 66-98%] than in fulminant hepatic failure of A, B, or C type [45%, 28-62%, 15/33;p = 0.007] or in non-A, -B, or -C acute hepatitis [24%, 3-44%, 4/17; p = 0.0003]. The logistic regression analysis selected TT virus (p = 0.0009), age (p = 0.0116), and etiology (p = 0.0309) as independent variables associated with fulminant hepatic failure (coefficient of determination, 0.2335). CONCLUSIONS: TT virus comparatively plays a role in the pathogenesis of non-A, -B, or -C fulminant hepatic failure. (C) 2000 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Although replicative forms of TT virus (TTV) DNA have been found in the liver and bone marrow cells, mRNAs of TTV have not yet been detected in these tissues. The entire nucleotide sequence of a TTV clone [TYM9 (3759 bases)] isolated from a patient with high TTV viremia (106 copies/ml) was determined, and the poly(A)+ 1RNAs from bone marrow cells were subjected to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction with primers specific for the TYM9 sequence. Sequence analysis of the amplified products revealed the presence of three distinct species of spliced TTV mRNAs [2.9, 1.2, and 1.0 kilobases (kb)] with common 5′ and 3′ termini as well as splicing to bind nucleotide (nt) 181 to nt 283. The shorter mRNAs of 1.2 kb and 1.0 kb possessed another splicing to join nt 681 with nt 2341 or nt 2579. The transcription profile of TTV found in an infected human corroborates that observed in vitro. © 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - The main site of TT virus (TTV) replication remains unknown. Therefore, we have studied the presence and titres of TTV DNA in paired serum, liver and PBMC samples from 50 patients with liver disease (32 with chronic hepatitis B or C, seven with cryptogenic hepatitis and 11 with nonviral liver disease) were included. TTV DNA was analysed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers from the open reading frame 1 (ORF 1) and from the untranslated region (UTR) and titres were semiquantified by PCR using an external standard. TTV DNA was detected in 26% of serum, 24% of liver and 14% of PBMC samples with ORF 1 primers. When UTR primers were used, 70% of serum and liver samples and 64% of PBMC were TTV DNA positive. No differences between TTV positive and negative patients were found regarding epidemiological or biochemical parameters. Trypsin treatment and fluorescent in situ hybridization confirm the intracellular location of TTV in PBMC. The mean of TTV DNA titres was statistically higher in liver than in serum or PBMC. TTV titres in serum correlated with those in PBMC but not with those in liver. In conclusion, although the liver seems to be the main site for TTV replication, this virus is also able to infect PBMC.

AB  - We reassessed the prevalence of TT viral DNA in Italian blood donors by using primers derived from a highly conserved non-coding region of the viral genome. Our previous underestimation of the prevalence of TTV is proved by the new figure obtained: 85% vs 5%. Again, we observed no difference with respect to a group oF potential donors with elevated alanine aminotransferase levels.

AB  - Objective. It is currently unknown which mechanisms are responsible for TT virus (TTV) infection in early childhood and whether it may be transmitted in utero from mother to infant. Methods. The prevalence, mode and extent of maternal TTV transmission was investigated by testing blood, cord blood and breast milk samples from mother-infant pairs for the existence of the novel DNA virus. Results. By means of polymerase chain reaction, TTV DNA was detected in 57 (41.3%) of 138 mothers and in 19 (13.8%) of 138 cord blood samples; therefore 33.3% of infants are likely to be infected by their mothers during the fetal period. Direct sequencing of TTV DNA from 2 mother-child pairs showed identical isolates. Follow-up sera from 3 TTV infected babies showed persistence of viremia. In blood samples from newborns older than 1 week 9 (27.3%) of 33 sera were TTV-positive. Viral sequences were also detected in 2 of 2 breast milk samples. In none of the infected subjects were biochemical or clinical signs of hepatitis observed. Conclusions. Our data prove that TT virus is efficiently transmitted transplacentally. The increase of its prevalence in the group of newborns older than 1 week suggests that it may be furthermore transmitted postnatally. Therefore in our Caucasian population, vertical transmission, particularly in utero transmission, of TTV is likely to account for a major part of TTV infection in early childhood. However, no disease activity could be established for the novel virus by this infection route.

AB  - Objective: To review the litterature on the TT virus. Methods: The litterature review was based on articles identified through MEDLINE between Jan. 1, 1997, and August 15, 1999. Results: In 1997, a new DNA virus, designated TTV, was isolated and seemed to be associated with non A-G post-transfusion hepatitis. The virus was identified using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) because serology was not routinely available. At least 16 genotypes were identified. Depending on the PCR technique used, the prevalence of infection ranged from 17% to 71% in a group of sera tested. The prevalence rate ranged from 1.2% to 62% among blood donors, from 0.5% to 83% among hemophiliacs and from 1% to 71% in cases of chronic hepatitis. The current hypothesis is that routes of infection were parenteral and orofecal. The pathogenesis of this virus, if it really exists, is not yet clearly established. It has been postulated that some interaction may exist between the TT virus and the hepatitis C virus. The use of interferon seems to decrease the TT viremia, according to results obtained outside the context of clinical trials. Conclusion: The pathogenesis of the TT virus needs to be rapidly established for transmission prevention and therapeutic intervention.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) was first detected in the blood of three patients with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase following transfusion who were negative for all known hepatitis viruses. This virus exhibited hepatotropism, and its titers correlated with elevation in serum aminotransferase concentration suggesting that it was a true hepatitis virus. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the presence of TTV DNA is not associated with biochemical or histologic evidence of liver injury. The virus has been found worldwide with a high prevalence in the general population and there is evidence that it may be transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood, enterally and transmitted from mother to child. An association between TTV infection and acute or chronic hepatitis or other diseases has not been consistently observed.

AB  - Objective: TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered human DNA virus of uncertain clinical significance. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TTV infection among blood donors in Taiwan. Methods: Viral DNA was studied in 224 healthy blood donors and 118 deferred donors. DNA was extracted from plasma and amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction with reported primer sets from a conserved region of the TTV genome. Results: The prevalence of TTV DNA in the deferred donors was 24.6%, significantly higher than in the healthy donors (11.9%). TTV was also more prevalent in those with hepatitis B surface antigen than in those without it (p = 0.002). Conclusion: In comparing normal with deferred Taiwanese blood donors, hepatitis B virus infection is linked to a higher prevalence of TTV infection. Copyright © 2001 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Aim. To examine clinical, immunological and morphological features of HGV- and TTV-infections in patients with chronic hepatic diseases (CHD) and assess efficiency of treatment of HGV-seropositive patients. Material and methods. 202 patients with CHD were examined for markers of HBV-, HCV-, HGV-and TTV-infections. Some patients were subjected to puncture biopsy of the liver. Efficiency of interferon-alpha treatment of HGV and HBV/HCV coinfection was studied. Results. HGV RNA and TTV DNA were detected in 19.8 and 11.8% of cases, respectively. Biochemical indices in patients with HGV and TTV monoinfections significantly differed from those in the control group while morphological changes in most of them corresponded to those with hepatitis. INF-alpha was given to 7 patients with HGV+HBV/HCV infections. A response was achieved in 3 months in 2 of them. Conclusion. The role of HGV and TTV in hepatic diseases pathology is still unclear. Further studies on detection and examination of patients infected with G and TT viruses are necessary. When choosing therapy, the presence of HGV RNA and TTV DNA in blood serum, virus genome in hepatocytes and histological changes in hepatic tissue should be considered.

AB  - Aplastic anemia has been reported to occur after viral hepatitis of unknown etiology. Recently, TT virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus, was identified in a Japanese patient with posttransfusion non-A-E hepatitis. The prevalence of TTV infection was investigated among blood donors and patients with aplastic anemia in Thailand. Of 99 blood samples from blood donors, 37 tested positive for TTV DNA via semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using TTV-specific primers. Seventeen percent of samples from blood donors younger than 20 were positive for TTV DNA, whereas 48% from donors older than 20 were positive. The high prevalence of TTV infection in Thailand is comparable to that reported in China (28%), Mongo-Iia (43%), and Egypt (29%). Forty-two percent of newly diagnosed aplastic anemia patients tested also had TTV DNA in blood. The detection rate of TTV DNA in aplastic anemia patients does not differ significantly from rates in normal blood donors. Our present data thus argue against the role of this novel hepatitis-associated virus in the pathogenesis of aplastic anemia in Thailand. However, larger epidemiological studies may be needed to further evaluate their association. © 2000 The Japanese Society of Hematology.

AB  - Objective: To investigate transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection among population of different groups in Shaanxi Province. Methods: A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers from ORF1 of TTV genome was established to detect TTV-DNA in serum of the patients. Results: TTV-DAN was detected in the sera of 3 of 50 cases of general population(6%), 2 of 30 cases of vocational blood donors (6.7%),21 of 97 cases with Type B hepatitis (21.6%), 9 of 35 cases of Type C hepatitis (25.7%),and 23 of 40 cases with non-A∼non-G hepatitis (57.5%). Conclusion: There is TTV infection among general population in Shaanxi Province. TTV may be an important agent to cause non-A∼non-G hepatitis. And the patients with HBV or HCV can have overlapping TTV infection.

AB  - The role of TT virus (TTV) as a human pathogen is unclear, as is the mode of TTV transmission. To determine the prevalence of TTV infection and the possible fecal-oral route of transmission, we analyzed fecal specimens from 67 healthy, nontransfused children for TTV DNA sequences by heminested PCR, using the NG and T primer sets. The overall prevalence of TTV fecal excretion was 22.4% (15 of 67), with the T primer set (19.4%) being more sensitive than the NG primer set (10.4%). TTV prevalence based on gender or ethnicity showed no significant differences. None of seven children in the 0- to 6-month age group had detectable TTV in feces. Of three sets of siblings, two unrelated sets of twins, ages 33 and 37 months, were negative for fecal TTV DNA, while the third set of siblings, ages 99 and 35 months, was positive. The absence of TTV in the feces of children younger than 6 months and the high prevalence (40%) in children 7 to 12 months of age is consistent with age-specific acquisition of TTV infection by the nonparenteral route. TTV genotypes 1, 3, 4, and 5 were represented in our study population. TTV-positive siblings had TTV genotypes 1 and 4, suggesting unrelated environmental sources of TTV infection. This observation suggests a possible time frame for TTV acquisition in children which coincides with increased interaction with their environment and increased susceptibility to infectious agents.

AB  - Recently, we identified TT virus (TTV) isolates from nonhuman primates and named them simian TTV (s-TTV). To characterize the genomic structure of these isolates in more detail, the full-length nucleotide sequence of the s-TTV isolate (designated s-TTV CH65-1), recovered from a chimpanzee born in West Africa, was amplified by nested PCR with inverted primers deduced from the untranslated region of s-TTV DNA. CH65-1 was composed of 3899 nucleotides (nt) and had two open reading frames (ORF) spanning 2295 nt (ORF1) and 402 nt (ORF2). The sequence had only 52.3% similarity to the prototype TA278 human isolate. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that CH65-1 was distinct from the human TTV isolates. These results suggested that s-TTV may represent a new TTV-like viral species or genus. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - By means of polymerase chain reaction with a primer pair (NG133-NG147) deduced from the untranslated region (UTR) of TT virus (TTV), TTVs with markedly distinct genomic lengths were recovered from sera of humans and nonhuman primates, and their entire nucleotide sequences were determined. A human TTV [TGP96 of 2908 nucleotides (nt)] was obtained that was about 900 nt shorter than heretofore reported TTVs (3787-3853 nt). Likewise, TTVs of chimpanzee occurred in two distinct genomic sizes [Pt-TTV6 (3690 nt) and Pt-TTV8-II (2785 nt)]. Two TTVs of Japanese macaque [Mf-TTV3 (3798 nt) and Mf-TTV9 (3763 nt)] were comparable in genomic length, but only 55% similar in sequence. These five human and nonhuman primate TTVs, along with TTVs of tamarin [So-TTV2 (3371 nt)] and douroucouli [At-TTV3 (3718 nt)], were compared over the entire nucleotide sequence. Although the seven TTVs were only ≤55% similar, they share a common genomic organization with two open reading frames (ORFs), designated ORF1 (654-735 amino acids) and ORF2 (91-152 amino acids). The N-terminal sequences of ORF1 proteins were rich in arginine, and sequence motifs necessary for transcription and replication were conserved among them all. Like the human prototype TTV (TA278), all seven TTVs from various animals possessed in common two 15-nt sequences (CGAATGGCTGAGTTT and AGGGGCAATTCGGGC) in the UTR that were covered by NG133 and NG147, respectively. These primers would be instrumental in research on TTVs in previously unexamined species for defining their virological characteristics and evolutionary relationships. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - In 1997, a novel DNA virus was isolated from the sera of patients with liver disease associated with non-A to G hepatitis in Japan, and named Transfusion Transmitted virus (TTV). TTV is a naked, single-stranded and circular DNA virus, and its entire nucleotide sequence of 3.9 kb has been determined. Until now at least 16 genotypes of this virus have been identified and its genomic organization found to be similar with Circoviridae. TTV infection is widespread in the general populations from different countries. One of the possible route of transmission is parenterally, but the high rate of viremia observed in healthy subjects indicates that this route is not the only mode for TTV spread. Because TTV may be secreted via bile into feces in a transmissible form and would spread by a fecal-oral route for wide penetration into the general population. Although TTV was detected frequently in a patient with non-A to G acute and chronic hepatitis, no etiologic role for TTV could be established. The pathogenic effects of TTV on hepatitis appear to be limited. Although the high prevalence of TTV in healthy subjects may indicate the TTV as non-hepatopathogenic virus, further studies will be needed before drawing the conclusion.

AB  - Fecal supernatant or serum containing TT virus (TTV) of genotype 1a (105 copies/ml) from patients with acute TTV infection was inoculated intravenously into two naive chimpanzees. Serum samples were obtained weekly and tested for TTV DNA by genotype 1-specific polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in chimpanzee 228 at weeks 5-15 after inoculation with 0.5 ml of serum, and in chimpanzee 234 at weeks 7-19 after inoculation with 1 ml of fecal supernatant. The TTV DNA titer peaked at weeks 12 and 13 in chimpanzee 228 and at weeks 14-16 in chimpanzee 234. Mild biochemical and histological changes in biopsied liver samples were observed in both chimpanzees in association with the reduction in TTV titer. TTV DNA was transient in chimpanzee 228, but in chimpanzee 234 it reappeared at week 21 and persisted through week 30. These results indicate that TTV in feces is infectious and suggest that TTV has hepatitis-inducing capacity. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - The seroprevalence and determinants of hepatitis B, C, and E virus infection, and of GBV-C/hepatitis G virus and TT virus infection were investigated among women from a rural area of northeastern Tanzania. High seroprevalence rates were found for TTV (74%), HBV (74%), and GBV-C/HGV (35%), whereas 7% of the women had evidence of HCV and HEV infection. The majority of TTV DNA sequences in the study population belonged to the genotypes 1 or 2. One sequence seems to represent a new subtype of genotype 4. The GBV-C/HGV sequences either belonged to the genomic Group 1b or to the recently described Group 4. In multivariate analysis, the detection of TTV DNA was associated significantly with a larger number of children in the household and with older age. A history of injections of contraceptive hormones was an independent risk factor for HCV infection. The findings on TTV are consistent with fecal-oral transmission, and recurrent infections may occur in adults. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Although TT virus (TTV) is transmissible by blood or blood products, many patients with no history of transfusion of blood and blood products have been shown to be infected, suggesting other possible routes of transmission. To investigate the transmission routes and replication sites of TTV, 85 paired saliva and serum samples were studied by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of TTV DNA was 38% (32/85 samples) and 21% (18/85) in saliva and serum, respectively. Fifteen patients had TTV DNA both in saliva and serum. Six out of fifteen patients had significantly higher viral titers in saliva than in serum, but none had higher titer in serum than in saliva. When the 222 base-pair nucleotide sequences of PCR products amplified from the samples were analyzed, 12 patients had the same genotype/subtype in saliva and serum and exhibited high homology (96-100%). The other 3 had different genotypes/subtypes in saliva and serum, and the homology was 61.9-87.2%. Mixed infection was observed both in saliva and serum. Further studies are required to determine if a subgroup of TTV has tropism to saliva. The high prevalence and viral load of TTV in saliva suggest that salivary fluid may be a possible route of transmission of TTV and that TTV might replicate not only in liver tissue but also in other tissues such as oropharyngeal tissues and/or salivary glands.

AB  - A new generation of blood components and transfusion modalities aimed at further reducing real or hypothetical risks threatening the blood supply is available. Since the risk of infection with transfusion-transmitted viruses is already very low, many of these new interventions provide a minimal health benefit at a very high cost. It is even possible that risks inherent to the new technologies themselves could surpass the current risk of transfusion-transmitted viruses. For some of the new blood components, such as leukoreduced products, the poor cost-effectiveness projections may be substantially improved if the purported health benefits are eventually proved in appropriate randomized, controlled clinical trials. Meanwhile, cost-effectiveness analyses show that allocating more resources to improve the safety of donated blood may actually decrease the overall transfusion safety by subtracting resources from other areas of the health care system, so a realignment of costs with health benefits seems necessary.

AB  - Background. Recently, TT virus (TTV) was discovered as a potential causative agent for non-A-E hepatitis. Little is known about the prevalence of TTV infection in renal transplant recipients. Methods. One hundred and seventeen Brazilian renal transplant recipients and 100 normal subjects were examined to determine the prevalence of TTV infection. The TTV DNA in serum and its genotype were examined using polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme length polymorphism, respectively. Results. TTV DNA was detected in 63/117 (53.8%) rehal transplant recipients in contrast to its detection in 10/100 (10%) normal subjects (P<0.001). There was no statistical difference in the distribution of TTV genotypes between these groups. There was no significant difference in clinical backgrounds between TTV positive and negative patients. Conclusions. These results indicate a risk for TTV infection in renal transplant recipients in Brazil. They also indicate that TTV itself might not have a strong correlation with the pathogenicity of liver diseases.

AB  - The role of a novel virus, designated as TT virus (TTV), as a cause of chronic liver disease has not been well defined. We investigated the prevalence of TTV among 69 patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology and 50 volunteer blood donors with normal transaminase levels. TTV DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) by using two different sets of primers: one based on the sequence of the original N22 clone within the open reading frame 1 (set A) and the other derived from the untranslated region (set B). The prevalence of TTV detected by PCR primers set A only, set B only, and in total (by either set A or B) was 11 (31%), 31 (86%), and 31 (86%) of 36 patients with chronic hepatitis; 2 (40%), 4 (80%), and 4 (80%) of 5 with cirrhosis; 11 (39%), 17 (61%), and 22 (79%) of 28 with hepatocellular carcinoma; and 9 (18%), 39 (78%), and 40 (80%) of 50 volunteer blood donors, respectively. Of the interpretable 25 PCR products amplified with primers set A, 9 were classified as genotype 1a, 10 as genotype 1b, 4 as genotype 2, 1 as genotype 3, and 1 as genotype 4. Molecular evolutionary analysis did not suggest any particular strains of TTV that might be associated with chronic liver disease. The nucleotide sequences of the untranslated region on which PCR primers set B were designed were highly conserved, and the interpretable 22 PCR products amplified with primers set B were not clearly divisible into distinct genotypes. Our findings provided no evidence that TTV is a causative agent of chronic liver disease. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - In western India, TT virus (TTV) DNA positivity varied from 6.7% (5 of 75) in chronic hepatitis patients to 24.4% (10 of 41) in hemophiliacs; 7.4% (4 of 54) of voluntary blood donors had circulating TTV DNA. Phylogenetic analysis revealed a predominance of genotype 1a. In India, TTV is transmitted mainly by nonparenteral routes and is not an important cause of chronic liver diseases.

AB  - TT-virus (TTV, patient initials: T.T.), a novel DNA virus, was first isolated in Japan in 1997 from serum of a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. To date, the contribution of TTV to liver disease remains doubtful. The potential for transmission via blood and blood products makes it essential to establish the prevalence of TTV viraemia in the blood donor population. 413 blood donor serum samples were chosen randomly, the DNA was extracted and TTV-specific DNA amplified by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV infection was present in 13 out of 413 (3.15%) blood donors in the Auckland region of New Zealand using a set of primers targeting open reading frame (ORF) 1. These 13 amplification products (264 bp) were sequenced and TTV genotypes determined. Alignment with published TTV sequences showed that seven (53.8%) of the thirteen positive serum samples belonged to genotype 1, five (38.5%) belonged to genotype 2 and one (7.7%) could not be classified as either genotype 1 or 2. One hundred twenty-seven blood donor serum samples were retested with a second set of primers targeting the 5' region of the TTV genome in a single round PCR. Forty-three samples were positive for TTV DNA with these primers resulting in a prevalence of 37%. The data demonstrate that TTV is present among New Zealand blood donors and support the need for further investigation into the natural history of TTV infection. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - DNA sequences of TT virus (TTV) in 55 serum samples taken from 20 children with liver disease of unknown etiology (16 with acute liver disease, 2 with fulminant hepatitis, and 2 with chronic liver disease) and from 35 healthy children as controls were examined by using the hemi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR was carried out using the established primers (NG059, NG061, NG063) to amplify TTV DNA sequences. The sequences were detected in 6 of the 20 patients (30.0%) with liver disease and in 5 of the 35 healthy children (14.2%) by direct gel analysis. There was no significant difference between the prevalence of liver disease patients and controls. However, both patients with fulminant hepatitis and both patients with chronic hepatitis had TTV DNA sequences. Four of the six TTV isolates from liver disease patients were genotype 1a, whereas only one of the five TTV isolates from controls was genotype 1a. Although the study population was small, it is possible that genotype 1a of TTV might be more pathogenic than other genotypes in children. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Analyses of a collection of full-length TT virus genomes showed nearly half of them to be recombinant. The results were highly significant and revealed homologous recombination both within and among genotypes, often involving extremely divergent lineages. Recombination breakpoints were significantly more common in the noncoding region of the TT virus genome than in the coding region.

AB  - An outbreak of enterically transmitted hepatitis occurred during 1996 among students at a vocational school. Viral fragments homologous to transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) were detected in faeces. To elucidate the endemic status, an epidemiological survey and case follow-up after the outbreak were carried out. During and after the outbreak, virus carriers among staff were, respectively, 32.1% and 31.3% in serum, and 24.6% and 18.2% in faeces. After the last outbreak, attacks were still occurring among new students with an incidence of 2.4% in 1997 and 2.3% in 1998. There was also a small-scale outbreak in 1998 with a prevalence of 17.9%. On follow-up at 6 and 18 months after onset, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation was found in 29.7% and 13.9% of patients. At 6 months, viral fragments were detected in serum in 78.1% and 46.7% of patients, with and without ALT elevation, respectively. At 18 months the corresponding figures were 55.6% and 19.2%, respectively. At the 18-month follow-up, viral fragments were detected in faeces in 29.6% and 19.3% of patients with and without ALT elevation. In conclusion, this disease might be transmitted from asymptomatic virus carriers. According to the laboratory data, both parenteral and non- parenteral transmissions are involved, and the faecal-oral route might be more important.

AB  - Transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) has been identified from patients with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology, but the clinical relevance remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate TTV in liver. We studied 15 patients with hepatitis non-A-E and 44 with hepatitis B virus (HBV). The nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with primers corresponding to the conserved region of the published TTV genome was employed to amplify TTV fragments in serum, and in situ hybridization was used to detect TTV in biopsied liver specimens. TTV DNA was detected in serum from six (40%) of 15 patients with hepatitis of unknown aetiology and from 16 (36.4%) of 44 patients with chronic hepatitis B, respectively. The intrahepatic viral fragment was detected in 17 (77.3%) of 22 patients with TTV in serum. There was no statistical difference in the prevalence of TTV infection between the two groups (hepatitis non-A-E 40% vs HBV 25%, P &gt; 0.75). When patients in both groups, with and without TTV, were compared, no differences were found in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels (hepatitis non-A-E: 131.5 ± 66.6 vs 244.2 ± 257.4, P = 0.955; HBV: 240.1 ± 418.9 vs 214.6 ± 276.7 U l-1, P = 0.761) or histological activity index (grade) score (hepatitis non-A-E: 6.4 ± 5.5 vs 5.6 ± 5.9, P = 0.689; HBV: 5.6 ± 3.7 vs 5.5 ± 3.7, P = 0.345). HBV DNA levels in patients with and without TTV co-infection did not differ significantly (300 ± 776.4 μg ml- 1 vs 97.1 ± 160.5 μg ml-1, P = 0.980). Hence, TTV does exist in liver, but plays no role in hepatitis or aggravation of liver damage when co- infected with HBV.

AB  - To clarify the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection in renal transplant recipients and to estimate the role of TTV in patients with post-transplant liver function abnormalities, TTV-DNA of 47 renal transplant recipients was screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) according to a method described by Okamoto et al. before and after the renal transplantation. One of them was positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), one was positive for anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other 45 were negative for both HBsAg and anti-HCV. TTV-DNA was detected in 22 of 47 patients before renal transplantation, and nine became positive after transplantation. All 47 patients showed a normal level of ALT before transplantation. Three of nine (33%) who became positive for TTV-DNA after transplantation and three of 16 (19%) who were negative for TTV-DNA before and after transplantation showed transient elevation of ALT. These results indicate that TTV was highly prevalent among renal transplant recipients, but a clear association between TTV and post-transplant liver function abnormality was not found.

AB  - A novel DNA virus (TT virus; TTV) was isolated from a patient with post- transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. If TTV replicates in the liver, TTV may appear in the bile. In the present study, to clarify whether fecal- oral infection occur via biliary excretion, the presence of TTV DNA was assessed in paired serum and bile samples collected from 28 patients with obstructive jaundice without parenchymal liver disease. TTV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using semi-nested primers, and quantified by Real Time Detection PCR (RTD-PCR). The nucleotide sequence of isolates TTV DNAs was also determined and the sequences were compared between serum and bile samples. Among 28 patients, 7 were positive for TTV DNA in both samples, and 3 and 2 were positive in serum and bile respectively. Of 7 patients positive for TTV DNA in both samples, the TTV DNA titer was higher in serum of 4 patients and in bile of 1 patient. Among 7 patients positive for TTV DNA in serum and bile, 6 had the same sequence in both samples. Multiple distinct types of TTV DNA clones were isolated from serum in 2 patients and from bile in 4 patients. In conclusion, TTV DNA is detected frequently in bile from patients with obstructive jaundice, suggesting a fecal-oral route of infection and high prevalence of asymptomatic TTV carriers. TTV DNA was detected only in serum from some patients, suggesting that replication of TTV may occur in other organs as well as in the liver. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is transfusion-transmissible but its involvement in post- transfusion hepatitis is uncertain. To investigate the potential association of TTV with liver diseases, the prevalence of TTV DNA was tested by semi- nested PCR in 113 carriers of hepatitis C virus (HCV), 10 patients with acute liver failure, 11 patients with cryptogenic cirrhosis and 200 control blood donors. Thirty-seven of these patients underwent liver transplantation and were tested pre- and post-transplantation. TTV DNA was semi-quantified in serial samples from seven patients with unexplained post-transplant hepatitis. TTV genotyping was performed on samples from 28 patients by sequence analysis. The prevalence of TTV DNA in blood donors was 1.5% and 17% in HCV infected haemophiliacs. In patients with acute or chronic liver disease or hepatitis, 6 to 27% prevalence was observed. After liver transplantation, the prevalence of TTV DNA increased from 16 to 46% (P < 0.01). In patients who developed unexplained hepatitis post-transplantation, TTV viraemia did not parallel ALT levels. TTV DNA either increased in titre or became detectable shortly after transplantation, suggesting that either TTV was transfusion-transmitted, or, more likely, that immunosuppression caused a recurrence of low level or undetectable TTV viraemia. TTV had considerable genomic diversity in the N22 region, corresponding to at least 4 genotypes. Genotype 2 was found in 14/28 patients. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - Serum and liver tissues from hepatitis B surface antigen-negative/anti- hepatitis C virus (HCV)-negative (non-B, non-C) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients in Japan were examined for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and TT virus (TTV) by polymerase chain reaction. The studies evaluated the contribution of these viruses to pathogenesis of HCC. HBV DNA was detected in the sera of 20 (47.6%) of 42 non-B, non-C HCC patients, which was significantly higher than in age-matched controls without liver disease (P < .001). In 8 of 12 patients with liver tissues available, HBV DNA was detected in cancerous and adjacent noncancerous liver tissues. No HCV RNA was detected. The positivity for TTV DNA was not significantly different between HCC patients and controls. These results indicate that HBV is associated with a substantial proportion of non-B, non-C HCC cases in Japan. The role of HBV in hepatocarcinogenesis in such patients needs to be clarified.

AB  - Currently seven viruses, A, B, C, D, E, G and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV), are recognised in the hepatitis virus alphabet. Hepatitis G virus and TTV probably do not cause liver disease in humans. Hepatitis A and E usually cause a self-limiting hepatitis followed by complete recovery but occasionally cause fulminant hepatic failure. Hepatitis B and C are major public health problems worldwide due to their sequelae of chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and primary liver cancer. Chronic hepatitis C is a particular health issue for Western Europe already, accounting for 40% of endstage cirrhosis and 30% of liver transplants. The contribution of hepatitis C to chronic liver disease is predicted to rise in the future. Vaccines can prevent hepatitis A and B. Interferon alpha is effective treatment in 25-30% of patients with chronic hepatitis B or C. The prospects for treating chronic hepatitis B have been improved by the introduction of reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Lamivudine is the first drug of this class to be licensed. The optimal use of these new drugs is currently being studied. The success rate for treating chronic hepatitis C can be raised to about 40% with combination therapy of interferon alpha and ribavirin. A large research effort to discover new antiviral agents against hepatitis C is already giving the prospect of more effective therapies in the next few years.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The pathogenic role of TT virus (TTV) is not well known, especially during chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. We retrospectively investigated the presence of TTV DNA in the plasma of patients with chronic HCV infection and compared the characteristics of TTV-DNA-positive and -negative groups. METHODS: Between November 1996 and November 1998, 234 patients were included. Inclusion criteria were persistently elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positivity, and seronegativity for hepatitis B virus and human immunodeficiency virus markers. TTV DNA was amplified in nested polymerase chain reaction with TTV-specific primers, and products were analyzed by agarose-gel electrophoresis. Data were analyzed using the χ2, Fisher's exact test, or Mann- Whitney test, as appropriate. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 19 (8.1%; 95% confidence interval: 4.6-11.6%) patients. TTV-DNA- positive and TTV-DNA-negative patients did not differ statistically for age, gender ratio, source of HCV infection, HCV disease duration, biological parameters, histological grade, HCV- RNA load, or HCV genotype. Although nonsignificant (p = 0.21), there was a trend for a higher prevalence of TTV DNA in patients with an unknown cause of HCV infection (4/22, 18.2%) than in intravenous drug users (4/84; 4.8%), in those exposed to potential risk factors (4/49; 8.2%), or in those having received blood transfusion (7/79; 8.9%). CONCLUSIONS: Because the rates of HCV replication and the severity of liver lesions in TTV-DNA- negative and -positive patients were similar, the hepatic pathogenicity of TTV in chronic hepatitis C patients is questionable.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: TT virus (TTV) has been identified as a candidate agent of non-A-E hepatitis virus. We investigated superinfection of TTV in patients with chronic hepatitis C and studied the susceptibility to interferon (IFN) treatment and its association with liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: TTV DNA was examined using the seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and its virus level was measured by the real-time fluorometric PCR. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 20 of 102 (19.6%) patients examined. There was no significant difference in the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level between patients with or without TTV DNA. Quantitative analysis of HCV RNA and TTV DNA revealed no correlation between virus levels in HCV/TTV- coinfected patients. Both TTV and HCV were sensitive to IFN therapy. Complete response to IFN with a sustained loss of viremia for 24 wk after completion of IFN treatment was found in 11 of 20 (55%) patients with respect to TTV DNA and in five of 20 (25%) patients with respect to HCV RNA. The mean pretreatment HCV RNA level was significantly lower in the complete-response cases than in the no-response cases, but there was no significant difference in the pretreatment TTV DNA levels between them. ALT normalization resulting from IFN therapy was not attributable to the eradication of TTV DNA but was attributable to that of HCV RNA. Superinfection by TTV did not influence the effect of IFN against HCV. No specific TTV genotype correlating with IFN sensitivity was found. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that TTV infection stands independent of HCV infection, with no influence on liver injury as a result of HCV infection. (C) 2000 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

AB  - To clarify whether TT virus (TTV) was present in liver tissues, 12 liver tissue samples from patients with chronic hepatitis positive for TTV in their serum and 11 samples from serum-negative patients were obtained by needle biopsies and investigated using in situ hybridization. Positive staining was observed in nine (75%) of 12 cases positive for TTV (serum-positive group) and three (27.3%) of 11 cases negative for TTV (serum-negative group) (P = 0.061). Three kinds of staining patterns were observed: nuclear, cytoplasmic and both. In 58.3% (7 12) of the patients positive for TTV staining, the stained areas were found in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Only cytoplasmic staining was observed in three cases from the serum-positive group. Only nuclear staining was observed in two cases from the serum-negative group. No significant differences were found in the clinical background between the in situ hybridization- positive and -negative groups, and between the serum-positive and - negative groups. The present study shows that TTV exists in the liver tissue, especially in hepatocytes, of chronic hepatitis patients and that the localization of TTV in the cell is different from case to case, although why this is so remains to be clarified.

AB  - No clear association between human disease and TT virus (TTV) has been documented. A possible pathogenic role of TTV was investigated in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). TTV serum concentrations were estimated in 185 HIV-infected patients by dilution polymerase chain reaction. Of these, 149 (76%) were TTV-positive, compared with 18 (7%) of 252 Danish blood donors (P &lt; .001). Of the HIV-infected patients who were TTV- positive, 72 (51%) had high TTV viremia (≥5 times the highest concentration observed among blood donors, i.e., ≥3.5 x 105 TTV/mL of serum). High TTV viremia was associated with decreased survival (P &lt; .001; relative hazard [RH], 2.0). There was a correlation between lower CD4+ T cell counts and higher TTV titers (P&lt; .01). In a Cox regression model, CD4+ T cell count (P&lt; .001), age (P&lt; .001), HIV viral load (P&lt; .001), β2 microglobulin (P&lt; .02), and high TTV viremia (P &lt; .01; RH, 1.9) were independent predictors of survival. TTV is suspected to be an opportunistic pathogen with an independent influence on HIV progression.

AB  - Serum TT virus (TTV) DNA was determined in 83 human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV 1) infected mothers [46 intravenous drug user and 37 non- intravenous drug user women] and their infants. Twenty-nine (34.9%) mothers were TTV infected. Infection was more frequent among intravenous drug user than non-intravenous drug user mothers [21/46 (45.6%) vs. 8/37 (21.6%); relative risk (RR): 2.1; 95% confidence limits (95% CL): 1.1-4.2; P = 0.023] and among intravenous drug users who carried on injecting than in those who had given it up [10/14 (71.4%) vs. 11/32 (34.3%); RR: 2.1 (95%CL: 1.2-3.7); P = 0.021]. Infection was not related to age, CD4-positive T-lymphocyte counts, HIV 1 load, hepatitis B (HBV), G/GB-C (GBV-C/HGV), C (HCV) virus exposure. Eight (27.5%) infants born to TTV infected (but none of those born to TTV uninfected) mothers were TTV infected at a median age of 1.5 (range: 0.6-2.8) months. Infants born by vaginal/emergency caesarean delivery were more frequently infected than those born by elective caesarean delivery [7/16 (43.7%) vs. 1/13 (7.6%); RR: 2.1; 95%CL: 1.2-3.5; P = 0.033]. Infection in infants was not related to maternal CD4-positive T-lymphocyte counts, HIV 1 load, and HIV 1, HBV, GBV-C/HGV, or HCV transmission. No infant became TTV infected thereafter. No TTV infected child [follow-up: 31 (median; range: 6- 60) months] showed signs of liver disease; five infants cleared TTV DNA after 22 (median; range: 6-60) months. TTV infection in HIV 1 infected women is prevalently related to intravenous drug user. The findings suggest that infants may acquire TTV at birth. Infection may persist without evident liver disease.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to clarify the relationship between TT virus (TTV) infection and the development of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: TTV from serum was examined in 224 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and 106 patients with chronic liver disease (CLD) but without HCC who were admitted to our hospital between 1995-1997. As controls, 48 patients without liver disease were also examined. TTV DNA was detected using nested PCR method after extraction of DNA from serum. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 29/224 (13%) of patients with HCC; in 14% (4/28) of HCC patients negative for both hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV), in 9% (2/22) of HCC patients positive for HBsAg, and in 12% (21/170) of HCC patients positive for anti-HCV. The prevalence of TTV DNA in HCC patients (13%) was not significantly higher than in CLD patients (22%). There were no significant differences in age, gender, liver function, tumor biology (size, TNM classification), other viral markers, or amount of alcohol intake between TTV-positive and -negative HCC patients. Only a history of blood transfusion was significantly more frequent in TTV-positive HCC patients than in TTV-negative cases (p = 0.02). Coinfection with TTV did not correlate with the severity of HCV-positive liver disease. There was no significant difference in prognosis between TTV-positive and -negative HCC patients. Conclusions: TTV does not seem to contribute to the development of HCC from chronic liver disease and is not correlated with severity of liver disease.

AB  - Although transfusion-transmissible virus (TTV) is often present in the serum of patients with acute and chronic non-A-C liver diseases, its hepatotropism, pathogenicity to the liver and hepatocarcinogenicity have not been proven. We used a case-control format to compare the prevalence of TTV infection among 148 southern African Blacks with hepatocellular carcinoma and 148 matched hospital-based controls, and to test for possible interactive effects between this virus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the development of the tumour. We also determined the prevalence of TTV in 988 blood donors in Gauteng province of South Africa. The presence of TTV DNA in serum samples was detected by using the polymerase chain reaction, Southern hybridization and nucleotide sequencing. Individuals infected with TTV did not have an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (relative risk 1.1; 95% confidence limits 0.5-2.4). Moreover, co-infection with TTV did not further increase the risk of tumour development in patients chronically infected with HBV and/or HCV. TTV was present in the serum of 2.2% of blood donors: 4.0% in Black and 1.5% in White donors. We conclude that TTV is unrelated to the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in Black Africans.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A novel transfusion-transmissible human DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), has been discovered recently. An attempt was made to determine the incidence and clinical outcome of TTV infection in recipients of blood transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Serial serum samples collected as part of a prospective study of posttransfusion hepatitis were examined for TTV DNA by a nested PCR assay. RESULTS: Among 150 adults undergoing cardiac surgery, posttransfusion specimens from 59 individuals were positive for TTV DNA. Pretransfusion sera were found to be positive in 13 of these individuals. Therefore, 46 (33.6%) of the 137 previously uninfected patients developed new TTV viremia after transfusion. Among the 46 patients, 3 were coinfected with HCV, 5 were coinfected with HGV, and 38 were infected with TTV alone. No apparent symptoms or signs were noted in the 38 patients infected by TTV alone or the 5 infected with HGV plus TTV. The average peak serum ALT activity was 31 IU per L, with persistently normal levels in 34 of the 38 patients with TTV infection alone. In 8 other patients who subsequently developed well-documented non-A-G hepatitis, 3 were positive for TTV (3/8 vs. 46/137, p = 0.8). In 12 patients followed for more than 1 year, TTV viremia persisted in every case. CONCLUSION: n this population, TTV is transmitted by transfusion to approximately 30 percent of patients who undergo cardiac surgery. Most of the infections appear to become persistent. Despite the high prevalence rate, TTV does not appear to cause hepatitis on its own.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection in voluntary blood donors in Southeastern France. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: The sera of 289 blood donors were tested for the presence of TTV DNA by two PCR systems detecting genes located in the 5' UTR (primer set A [Set A]) and the open reading frame (ORF2) (primer set B [Set B]) of the viral genome. A randomized sample of 40 blood donors was also tested by a nested-PCR system in the ORF1 by use of primer set C (Set C). Donors were questioned for possible risk factors for virus transmission. RESULTS: In the entire population studied, 30.8 percent of blood donors tested positive with both Sets A and B, and 70.6 percent with at least one set. In the sample tested with three sets of primers, 27.5 percent of blood donors were positive in testing with all PCR systems and 80 percent with at least one system. The specificity of TTV DNA amplification was confirmed by sequencing 10 PCR products obtained with each set of primers. Statistical analysis revealed that the prevalence of TTV reactivity increased with age. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of TTV reactivity and the absence of a pathologic condition or risk factors obviously associated with the infection in blood donors suggest that there is no need for systematic detection of TTV infection before blood donation. Further studies are required to determine if TTV isolates can be responsible for a pathologic condition in humans after blood transfusion.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is an unenveloped, circular, and single-stranded DNA virus commonly infecting human beings worldwide. TTV DNAs in paired serum and liver tissues from three viremic individuals were separated by gel electrophoresis and characterized biophysically. TTV DNAs in sera migrated in sizes ranging from 2.0 to 2.5 Ida. TTV DNAs in liver tissues, however, migrated at 2.0 to 2.5 kb as well as at 3.5 to 6.1 kb. Both faster-and slower-migrating forms of TTV DNAs in the liver were found to be circular and of the full genomic length of 3.8 kb. TTV DNAs migrating at 2.0 to 2.5 kb, from either serum or liver tissues, were sensitive to S1 nuclease but resistant to restriction endonucleases, and therefore, they were single- stranded. By contrast, TTV DNAs in liver tissues that migrated at 3.5 to 6.1 kb were resistant to S1 nuclease. They migrated at 3.7 to 4.0 kb after digestion with EcoRI, which suggests that they represent circular, double- stranded replicative intermediates of TTV. When TTV DNAs were subjected to strand-specific primer extension and then amplified by PCR with internal primers, those in serum were found to be minus-stranded DNAs while those in liver tissues were found to be a mixture of plus- anti minus-stranded DNAs. These results suggest that TTV replicates in the liver via a circular double- stranded DNA.

AB  - It is now recognised that mixed viral infection, or infection of an individual with two or more distinct strains of a single viral species, often occurs particularly with RNA viruses. Current methods for detection of mixed infection normally involve genotyping or cloning and DNA sequencing. These methods are not always accurate or sensitive at detecting mixed infection and cannot be used for large numbers of samples. Furthermore subsequent sequence determination of the coinfecting viruses is labour intensive. This paper describes a simple, generic method based upon PCR and heteroduplex mobility analysis (HMA) that can be used to rapidly determine mixed infection with two strains of the same virus. The utility of this method is illustrated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TT virus (TTV) as examples. PCR-HMA detected mixed infection in 3 (8%) of 38 sera from intravenous drug users (IVDU) and 28 (30%) of 70 TTV-positive sera from Australia, China, and Vietnam. HMA can also be used to screen recombinant colonies to identify the sequences of the coinfecting viruses. The methods described here could be applied to analyse any PCR product containing two or more divergent sequences, whether derived from viruses, bacteria, or eukaryotic organisms.

AB  - Worldwide, viral infection is responsible for the majority of cases of acute liver failure, and the presence of co-existing chronic viral hepatitis may increase its severity. The newly described hepatotrophic viruses, hepatitis G virus and transfusion-transmitted virus, are unlikely to be major aetiological agents. In the USA and western Europe drug-induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause, and most frequently results from acetaminophen. Hepatotoxicity caused by Ecstasy is increasingly important, particularly in young adults. Hepatic encephalopathy and cerebral oedema remain important and life-threatening complications, and their pathogenesis is not completely understood. The effects of the cerebral metabolism of the high levels of ammonia that circulate in hepatic failure appear to be important. Induced hypothermia is a promising modality of treatment for refractory cerebral oedema, but the only form of treatment known to improve survival is emergency liver transplantation. Living donor and auxiliary liver transplantation are likely to improve survival rates further and reduce the number of patients requiring long-term post-transplant immunosuppression.

AB  - TT virus is a virus distantly related to the Circoviridae family. We report here the complete genome characterization of two European human isolates (T3PB and TUPB) using a new and simple protocol for sequencing GC-rich genomic regions. Sequence analysis confirmed the existence of two major ORFs, of a CAV-like VP2 motif in ORF2 and of potential stem-loop structures in non-coding regions. Phylogenetic analyses based on complete genomic sequences of human isolates suggested that three different lineages exist at least. The first lineage includes genotypes 1, 2, and 3, and two other lineages include viruses related to the Japanese SANBAN and to the North American TUS01 isolates respectively. Sequence comparison made it possible to assign strain T3PB to genotype 3, and strain TUPB to the TUS01 group. Consequently, this study reports the first full-length sequence of a genotype 3 isolate and demonstrates that viruses belonging to the TUS01 lineage are present in the Old Word.

AB  - To elucidate the role of hepatitis viruses in the pathogenesis of Behcet's disease (BD), we measured hepatitis viral markers (anti-hepatitis A (anti-HA), HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc) and viral nucleic acids (hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA, GB virus C (GBV-C)-RNA, TT virus (TTV)-DNA) in the sera of 68 BD patients along with 76 blood donors matched for age and sex. Positivity of anti-HA in patients with BD (36.8%) was lower than that in blood donors (68.0%). Both anti-HCV and HCV-RNA were detected in only one (1.5%) patient with BD and in none of the blood donors. The prevalence ratios of HBsAg, anti-HBs, anti-HBc in both groups were similar (2.9:0, 16.2:15.8 and 17.7:19.7%, respectively). However, serum HBV-DNA was detected more frequently in BD patients (8/68; 11.8%) than in blood donors (2/76; 2.6%) (P < 0.05). The prevalence of GBV-C-RNA was also higher in patients with BD (4/68: 5.9%) compared with blood donors (0%). However, characteristics and clinical and features are similar between GBV-C-RNA-positive and -negative groups. With respect to the prevalence of TTV-DNA, there was no significant difference between BD patients (23.5%) and blood donors (30.3%). Our study indicates that HBV and GBV-C infection might be related to BD, although the role of these viruses remains to be investigated. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - TTV was initially identified by Nishizawa et al. as an agent associated with transfusion-transmitted hepatitis non A-non G. Around the world, the prevalence rate differs widely and several authors have found no differences in prevalence of TTV DNA between patients with cryptogenic chronic hepatitis and the general population. The studies performed until now do not support the hypothesis that this virus could be related to the pathogenesis of fiver diseases.

AB  - Although the association between TT virus (TTV) infection and hepatitis is controversial, the high prevalence of TTV infection in healthy blood donors and even higher rate among frequently transfused patients poses a potential threat to public health and clinical care. In addition, there is a lack of data concerning the prevalence and mode of transmission of TTV infection in different subpopulations in Taiwan. In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of TTV infection in 111 uremic patients receiving regular hemodialysis in a single hospital in Taiwan. Blood samples were collected and analyzed using a seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) designed to amplify a 271 base-pair DNA fragment. The results show that the overall TTV positive rate in uremic patients in our hospital was 61% (68/111), which was much higher than the reported TTV prevalence rate among the normal population (ranging from 1%-12%). The results of analysis of the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients indicate that blood transfusion may play an important role in TTV transmission (p < 0.05). In addition, the hepatitis B positive rate was significantly lower in TTV positive patients. However, liver function tests were not significantly different between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. The results of the present study suggest that blood transfusion plays an important role in TTV transmission in uremic patients.

AB  - A small percentage of persons with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) lack identifiable causes of liver pathology. The single-stranded DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), has been found in persons with acute and chronic liver injury. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to search for both TTV and parvoviruses in 293 HCC samples from Asia and Europe. TTV was found in >30% of Chinese and Italian samples but in only 13% of French samples. No clinicopathologic differences were found between TTV-positive and -negative populations. A significant association was found between TTV infection and hepatitis B virus (P < .01) and herpesviruses (P < .02) in HCC patients, suggesting that factors promoting these infections are associated with enhanced TTV positivity. Parvovirus B19 and adeno-associated virus were found in only 7.5% of the tumors. Taken together, these data suggest that TTV infection is unlikely to be associated with the induction or acceleration of the hepatocarcinogenic process in humans.

AB  - Virus fragments homologous to TTV were detected previously from an enterically transmitted outbreak of non-A-E hepatitis [Luo et al., 1999]. To test the susceptibility of the Rhesus monkey to this virus and to establish its transmission routes, 6 Rhesus monkeys were inoculated, 3 orally and another 3 intravenously. The inoculum was prepared by extracting and filtering feces collected from a patient during the incubation period identified in the described outbreak. A second group of 3 monkeys was used for the passage study. The feces and blood samples were collected for detection of the virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Four animals were subjected to liver biopsies and bile aspiration by open surgery for in situ virus detection. Viremia occurred in 4-7 days after intravenous and 7-10 days after oral inoculation. The virus was excreted in feces a few days after oral infection and simultaneously with viremia after intravenous inoculation. The virus was also detected in bile during the viremic phase. There was a prolonged carrier state with persistent viremia and virus excretion in feces for more than 6 months. Serum transaminase levels were not raised during the infection. The virus was present in both the cytoplasm and nuclei of hepatocytes, but no significant pathology was found. Therefore, the Rhesus monkey is susceptible to TT virus infection, but the virus seems nonpathogenic. Infection of the liver may be established either by oral or parenteral inoculation. The virus may be released from liver into the blood or via bile into feces, so it may be transmitted by both blood and fecal routes. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - The presence of a new DNA virus (TTV) has been reported in sera from patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. The precise replication site of TTV, however, has not been established. In this study, the presence of TTV in liver autopsy material, and in bone marrow biopsy and autopsy samples taken from a subacute hepatitis/aplastic anemia patient was determined by PCR and Southern blot analyses. Liver cells were found to contain only TTV DNA and not mRNA. Bone marrow material, especially that taken at biopsy, contained high levels of TTV DNA. It is suggested that the TTV replication site was in the bone marrow rather than in the liver, and that TTV infection was the cause of this patient's aplastic anemia. The precise etiological association of TTV with hepatitis remains to be established. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a human virus consisting of a single-stranded, circular DNA genome of 3.8 kilobases (kb). To examine whether TTV replicates in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bone marrow cells (BMCs), DNA was extracted from the PBMCs and/or BMCs of six TTV-infected individuals and separated by agarose gel electrophoresis. The TTV DNAs from the PBMCs migrated to the 2.0- to 2.5-kb region. The TTV DNAs from the BMCs migrated to the 2.0- to 2.5-kb and 3.3- to 6.1-kb regions. The faster-migrating TTV DNAs were sensitive to S1 nuclease, while the slower-migrating TTV DNAs were resistant and their position on the agarose gel shifted to the position of the full genomic size upon digestion with restriction enzyme PstI. Full-length inverted polymerase chain reaction on the slower-migrating, double-stranded TTV DNAs from the BMCs amplified a 3.8-kb product. Replicative intermediate forms of TTV DNA are present in BMCs but not in PBMCs. (C) 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified blood-borne virus. Its association with disease is still unknown, and screening of blood donors has not been implemented. Several genotypes of the TTV have been identified. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Three hundred seventy healthy blood donors were randomly selected and tested for TTV by the PCR method. Sequencing of a part of the genome was performed to identify various genotypes of the virus. ALT levels were determined in both infected and uninfected individuals. RESULTS: The TT virus (TTV), was detected in the sera of 23 (6.2%) of 370 healthy Icelandic blood donors; this prevalence is lower than that reported in Japan but higher than that in Scotland. The virus was found in all groups over the age of 19. Sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of 202 bp from open reading frame 1 demonstrated genotypes 1b and 2b 2c and genotype 4 isolates, with the latter bearing 89-percent nucleotide homology with other genotype 4 sequences deposited at GenBank. One sample showed a mixed genotype 1b/2c infection. Serum ALT levels were within normal limits in all infected individuals. CONCLUSION: The TTV carrier state does not cause significant liver injury.

AB  - A well recognized hazard of transfusion with blood or blood products is the acquisition of a viral infection. Parvovirus B19 and transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) are two of several non-enveloped viruses that may on rare occasions be present in coagulation factor concentrates. The prevalence of these viruses in the South African haemophilia population has not previously been studied. Thirty-nine haemophiliac children were investigated for evidence of parvovirus and TTV infection. 26 boys with haemophilia A had been treated with cryoprecipitate or intermediate purity factor VIII, and 13 boys with haemophilia B had received prothrombin complex concentrates. All the plasma products were prepared from South African donors and were virally inactivated by heat or solvent/detergent since 1992. A control group of 32 children who had not been transfused were also studied. IgG antibodies to B19 were present in 29 of the 39 patients (74%), 18/26 (69%) with haemophilia A and 12 of the 13 (85%) with haemophilia B. None of the patients was IgM antibody positive but two children were PCR positive for B19 DNA. Of the control children, 47% had IgG antibodies to B19, but none were IgM antibody or B19 DNA positive. TTV viral DNA was found in 10.2% of patients and in 9% of the control group. The results indicate that our locally produced plasma products are not a significant source of TTV transmitted infection but may contribute to infection by B19 parvovirus.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered infectious agent originally obtained from transfusion-related hepatitis. However, the causative link between the TTV infection and liver disease remains uncertain. Recent studies demonstrated that genome sequences of different TTV strains are significantly divergent. To assess genetic heterogeneity of the TTV genome in more detail, a sequence analysis of PCR fragments (271 bp) amplified from open reading frame 1 (ORF1) was performed. PCR fragments were amplified from 5 to 40% of serum specimens obtained from patients with different forms of hepatitis who reside in different countries (e.g., China, Egypt, Vietnam, and the United States) and from normal human specimens obtained from U.S. residents. A total of 170 PCR fragments were sequenced and compared to sequences derived from the corresponding TTV genome region deposited in GenBank. Genotypes 2 and 3 were found to be significantly more genetically related than any other TTV genotype. Moreover, three sequences were shown to be almost equally related to both genotypes 2 and 3. These observations suggest a merger of genotypes 2 and 3 into one genotype, 2/3. Additionally, five new groups of TTV sequences were identified. One group represents a new genotype, whereas the other four groups were shown to be more evolutionary distant from all known TTV sequences. The evolutionary distances between these four groups were also shown to be greater than between TTV genotypes. The phylogenetic analysis suggested that these four new genetic groups represent closely related yet different viral species. Thus, TTV exists as a 'swarm' of at least five closely related but different viruses. These observations suggest a high degree of genetic complexity within the TTV population. The finding of the additional TTV-related species should be taken into consideration when the association between TTV infections and human diseases of unknown etiology is studied.

AB  - The impact of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection on acute fulminant and non-fulminant hepatitis is unclear. In this study, serum samples from 164 patients with acute hepatitis of various aetiologies, from 34 asymptomatic hepatitis B virus carriers and from 202 healthy adults were tested for TTV DNA by the semiconserved nested polymerase chain reaction. TTV viraemia was prevalent in patients with acute hepatitis C, in patients with acute hepatitis D virus superinfection and in patients with non-A-E hepatitis (27-30%) but the incidence was not significantly different from that of healthy controls (31 of 202, 15.3%). There were no significant differences in gender, age, presence of hepatitis G virus, the occurrence of fulminant hepatitis, or in serum albumin, bilirubin or alanine aminotransferase levels (9/30 vs 35/134) between patients with or without TTV viraemia. Seven of the nine TTV-positive patients with fulminant hepatitis were co-infected with hepatitis C, D or E. TTV clones from 18 subjects, with or without fulminant hepatitis, were sequenced and analysed phylogenetically. Eleven (61.1%) belonged to TTV group 1, six (33.3%) to TTV group 2 and one to TTV group 3. No particular strain of TTV was associated with fulminant hepatitis. In summary, in Taiwan, TTV is prevalent in the general population as well as in patients with liver diseases. TTV plays an insignificant role in acute fulminant and non-fulminant hepatitis. Its influence on outcome requires a longitudinal study.

AB  - The virology and epidemiology of hepatitis A, B and C is well understood, however, there remain a number of cases of presumed viral hepatitis that cannot be explained on the basis of these agents. Hepatitis E is an RNA virus spread by faecal-oral route and causes an acute hepatitis that is rarely fulminant. Hepatitis G (or GBV-C) and Transmitted Transfusion Virus (TTV) are blood borne hepatotropic viruses. There is however, little evidence that these agents cause significant acute or chronic hepatitis.

AB  - TTV, a DNA virus, has been isolated from patients with non-A to non-E post-transfusion hepatitis. In the past it was assumed that TTV was transmitted parenterally. It is unclear whether sexual contact leads to transmission of this virus. In this study, two sets of TTV-specific polymerase chain reaction primers were used to detect serum TTV DNA in 140 prostitutes and 136 controls. The prevalence of TTV DNA in prostitutes was significantly higher than in the control group (46/140 [32.9%] vs. 29/136 [21.3%]; P = 0.043). There was no significant difference in the prevalence of positive antibody to hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) in either group (87.8% for prostitutes, 85.3% for controls). No particular risk factor was significantly associated with positive TTV DNA in prostitutes. In summary, TTV is highly prevalent in prostitutes. Transmission of TTV via sexual contact is not as efficient as transmission of hepatitis C and D viruses and GB virus-C hepatitis G virus. The high prevalence of TTV in controls indicates that there are diverse routes of transmission of this virus. (C) 2000 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

AB  - We employed a PCR assay system TaKaRa Ex Taq(TM) (heat-resistant DNA polymerase), which has 3' → 5' exonuclease activity to increase the sensitivity for TT virus (TTV) DNA detection. Sera obtained from 95 hepatitis B virus carriers without hepatitis C virus coinfection were tested for TTV DNA and the sensitivity of this assay system was compared with the PCR systems reported previously. Of the 95 individuals, TTV DNA was identified in 14 (14.7%) with the PCR reported by Nishizawa et al., in 66 (69.5%) with the PCR reported by Okamoto et al., in 80 (84.2%) by our assay system, and in 86 (90.5%) with the PCR reported by Takahashi et al. Phylogenetic analysis of nucleotide sequences amplified by the PCR revealed that genotypes 1a, 1b, 2, 3, 4, 5 were amplified efficiently by our assay system, while only a part of TTV DNA clone of genotype 1a was amplified by the PCR reported by Nishizawa et al. The prevalence of circulating TTV DNA became higher with age. These results indicate that our assay system with TaKaRa Ex Taq(TM) has confirmed high prevalence of TTV infection and that at least five genotypes prevail in Japan. In addition, acute TTV infection is supposed to cause long-standing viremia. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recently a novel DNA virus (TT virus) has been identified in Japan and shown to be associated with elevated aminotransferase levels after blood transfusion. The exact role of TTV in the pathogenesis of liver disease is yet to be established. Our aim was to determine the prevalence and role of TTV in the pathogenesis of elevated transaminases in healthy blood donors in the absence of markers for viral hepatitis A-C. METHODS: Stored sera were collected from 99 healthy blood donors with elevated alanine amino transferase (ALT) values that were discovered at the time of blood donation. A total of 146 samples were obtained from healthy donors with normal ALT values who were used as controls. None of the patients or controls had a history of blood transfusion or had clinical signs of acute or chronic hepatitis. Serological markers for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C viruses were negative. TTV DNA was amplified and detected using polymerase chain reaction followed by gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Five of 99 (5%) samples obtained from donors with elevated ALT had TTV DNA detected by PCR, as compared to one of 146 (0.7%) of those with normal ALT (p = 0.006). Among those with elevated ALT, mean ALT values in patients with TTV (296 ± 305 U/L) were higher than in patients without TTV (95 ± 37 U/L), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). The two samples with highest ALT values (both >450 U/L) were among the five samples with detectable TTV DNA in serum. CONCLUSIONS: Although TTV is not likely to explain the majority of elevated ALT cases in otherwise healthy blood donors, TTV infection may potentially be associated with some cases. Based on these findings, we propose that the role of TTV in the pathogenesis of acute and chronic liver diseases merits further investigation. (C) 2000 by Am. Coll. of Gastroenterology.

AB  - Background. The TT virus (TTV) was discovered in patients with symptomatic posttransfusion hepatitis, but many viremic individuals are asymptomatic. Inadvertent transfusion-associated transmission must therefore be anticipated. We screened blood donors and heart transplant recipients for TTV infections. Methods. Nested polymerase chain reaction was used to detect TTV DNA in plasma, serum, urine, and fecal samples from 600 blood donors, from 100 healthy individuals, and from 495 heart transplant recipients. Results. A total of 3.2% of the blood donors, but 25% of the heart transplant recipients were viremic. TTV subtypes G1a/b and G2a/b were observed in both groups, but the subtype distributions were discrepant. A severe, acute infection with TTV subtype 3 was observed in one blood donor. The prevalence of TTV infections in heart transplant recipients was not correlated to transfusion frequency. Nine viremic heart transplant recipients and their 75 blood donors were studied in detail. Seven blood donors were viremic, but only two 'pairs' of viremic blood donors and transfusion recipients had identical TTV isolates. TTV DNA was detected in the feces of 5% (5/100) of immunocompetent individuals (staff), in 46% (52/112) of viremic heart transplant recipients, and in the urine of 55% (20/36). TTV DNA was detected in six of six batches of pooled 'virus-inactivated' plasma (solvent/detergent treated), and in none of eight batches of commercial immunoglobulins. Conclusion. Although TTV is transfusion-transmissible, the parenteral transmission rate may have been overestimated. Many TTV infections are apparently acquired by nonparenteral routes. Immunoglobulins are safe but pooled plasma is not safe regarding TTV transmission.

AB  - We performed a case-control study to assess the role of hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (HGV), TT virus, alcohol intake, and tobacco smoking as risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the presence or absence of cirrhosis. We prospectively recruited 174 patients with a first diagnosis of HCC admitted to the main hospitals in Brescia, North Italy. On the basis of histological, clinical, and radiological criteria, the presence of cirrhosis was established in 142 cases, excluded in 21 cases, and remained undefined in 11 cases. Among the HCC cases without cirrhosis, a histological picture of normal liver was found in a single patient, chronic viral hepatitis was found in 11 patients, alcoholic hepatitis was found in 5 patients, nonspecific reactive hepatitis was found in 3 patients, and hemochromatosis was found in 1 patient. As controls, we also included 610 subjects unaffected by hepatic diseases and admitted to the same hospitals as cases. The odds ratios for having HCC according to positivity for HCV RNA, HBsAg and/or HBV DNA, and alcohol intake > 80 g/day (95% confidence interval) were as follows, in the presence and absence of cirrhosis, respectively: (a) 33.5 (17.7-63.4) and 19.7 (6-64.8) for HCV RNA; (b) 17.6 (9.0-34.4) and 20.3 (5.7-72.6) for HBsAg; and (c) 5.5 (3.1-9.7) and 4.6 (1.513.8) for alcohol intake. No association was found with HGV or TT virus infections or tobacco. This study has shown that most HCC cases arising in the area are due to HBV, HCV, or alcohol intake, in both the presence and absence of cirrhosis.

AB  - Six different hepatitis viruses have now been characterized. Hepatitis B and C are the two hepatitis infections that are of greatest concern for surgeons. Hepatitis B and C share several features that have led to this concern. Both are blood-borne infections. Both are associated with chronic infection ultimately leading to cirrhosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma, and both can be occupational infections for the surgeon after percutaneous injury associated with infected blood. Chronic hepatitis B infection is seen in 1.25 million people in the U.S. It is associated with a transmission rate to healthcare workers of 25 to 30 per cent following a hollow needle stick injury. Five per cent of acute infections result in chronic disease. It can be effectively prevented as an occupational infection by vaccination with the highly effective hepatitis B vaccine. Chronic hepatitis C infection is present in nearly 4 million people in the U.S. It has a lower rate of transmission than hepatitis B following needle stick injury, but it has a 50 to 80 per cent rate of chronic disease after acute infections. There is no vaccine for hepatitis C, and only prevention of blood exposure will avoid the risks of this occupational infection. Other hepatitis viruses are likely to be identified. Prevention of blood exposure, by the better use of barriers in the operating room and modification of surgical techniques, is recommended to prevent occupational infection from both known and unknown blood-borne viruses from the surgical patient.

AB  - Background and Objectives. A novel non-enveloped DNA virus, called TT virus (TTV), has been reported to be associated with post-transfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. Although its clinical role still remains obscure, its presence in blood donations might cause problems. It, therefore, appeared of interest to investigate TTV prevalence in voluntary blood donors. Design and Methods. A total of 595 Italian blood donors with and without elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were tested by polymerase chain reaction using two sets of semi-nested primers that amplify the well-known region in the N22 clone. The amplified products were then sequenced to assess the genotype by phylogenetic and restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses. Results. The prevalence of TTV in blood donors was 5±1.9% (25 out of 500) with a 95% confidence limit. A similar prevalence was found in 95 selected blood donors with increased ALT levels. A viral load of 103-104 viral DNA molecules/mL was found, thus indicating a rather narrow range of variability. A phylogenetic tree built up on the basis of 210 base sequences of ORF1 allowed isolates to be classified into 2 groups corresponding, at least, to two of the putatives TTV genotypes, group 1 and group 2 of Okamoto's classification. A similar classification was also obtained by site restriction enzyme analysis. Interpretation and Conclusions. The results show that TTV infection is present among Italian blood donors. No significant difference in prevalence of TTV infection was found between patients with normal and increased ALT, making the association between TTV infection and human hepatitis questionable.

AB  - Viruses resembling human TT virus (TTV) were searched for in sera from nonhuman primates by PCR with primers deduced from well-conserved areas in the untranslated region. TTV DNA was detected in 102 (98%) of 104 chimpanzees, 9 (90%) of 10 Japanese macaques, 4 (100%) of 4 red-bellied tamarins, 5 (83%) of 6 cotton-top tamarins, and 5 (100%) of 5 douroucoulis tested. Analysis of the amplification products of 90 to 106 nucleotides revealed TTV DNA sequences specific for each species, with a decreasing similarity to human TTV in the order of chimpanzee, Japanese macaque, and tamarin/douroucouli TTVs. Full-length viral sequences were amplified by PCR with inverted nested primers deduced from the untranslated region of TTV DNA from each species. All animal TTVs were found to be circular with a genomic length at 3.5 to 3.8 kb, which was comparable to or slightly shorter than human TTV. Sequences closely similar to human TTV were determined by PCR with primers deduced from a coding region (N22 region) and were detected in 49 (47%) of the 104 chimpanzees; they were not found in any animals of the other species. Sequence analysis of the N22 region (222 to 225 nucleotides) of chimpanzee TTV DNAs disclosed four genetic groups that differed by 36.1 to 50.2% from one another; they were 35.0 to 52.8% divergent from any of the 16 genotypes of human TTV. Of the 104 chimpanzees, only 1 was viremic with human TTV of genotype 1a. It was among the 53 chimpanzees which had been used in transmission experiments with human hepatitis viruses. Antibody to TTV of genotype 1a was detected significantly more frequently in the chimpanzees that had been used in transmission experiments than in those that had not (8 of 28 [29%] and 3 of 35 [9%], respectively; P = 0.038). These results indicate that species-specific TTVs are prevalent in nonhuman primates and that human TTV can cross-infect chimpanzees.

AB  - Newly discovered TT virus (TTV) is widely distributed in human populations. To understand more about the relationship between TTV and its hosts, we tested 400 sera from various nonhuman primates for the presence of TFV DNA by PCR assay. We collected serum samples from 24 different species of nonhuman primates. TFV DNA was determined by PCR with primers designed from the 5'-end region of the TTV genome. Nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of viral genomes were also performed. TTV DNA was detected in 87 of 98 (89%) chimpanzees and 3 of 21 (14%) crab-eating macaques. Nucleotide sequences of the PCR products obtained from both animals were 80 to 100% identical between two species. In contrast, the sequences differed from TTV isolates in humans by 24 to 33% at the nucleotide level and 36 to 50% at the amino acid level. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that all TTV isolates obtained from simians were distinct from the human TTV isolates. Furthermore, TTV in simians, but not in humans, was classified into three different genotypes. Our results indicate that TTV in simians represents a group different from, but closely related to, TTV in humans. From these results, we tentatively named this TTV simian TTV (s-TTV). The existence of the s-TTV will be important in determining the origin, nature, and transmission of human TTV and may provide useful animal models for studies of the infection and pathogenesis of this new DNA virus.

AB  - Although TT virus (TTV) was isolated from a cryptogenic posttransfusion hepatitis patient, its pathogenic role remains unclear. It has been reported that the majority of the healthy population is infected with TTV. To elucidate the differences between TTV infection in patients with liver diseases and TTV infection in the healthy population, a quantification system was developed. TTV DNA was quantified by a real-time detection PCR (RTD-PCR) assay on an ABI Prism 7700 sequence detector. With this system, TTV DNA was quantified in 78 hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients (63 with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase [ALT] levels and 15 with normal ALT levels) and in 70 voluntary blood donors (BDs). The quantification range was 2.08 to 7.35 log copies/ml. The intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation were 0.37 to 6.33% and 0.60 to 7.07%, respectively. The mean serum TTV DNA levels in the HCV-infected patients with both elevated and normal ALT levels and BDs were 3.69 ± 0.89, 3.45 ± 0.76, and 3.45 ± 0.67 log copies/ml, respectively. Comparison of the serum TTV DNA levels among the HCV-infected patients revealed that they were not related to the serum ALT and HCV core protein levels or to the histopathological score on liver biopsy. This study showed that (i) the RTD-PCR assay for the detection of TTV was accurate and had a high degree of sensitivity, (ii) the mean serum TTV DNA level was similar among HCV-infected patients, irrespective of their ALT level, and also among BDs, and (iii) a high serum TTV DNA level does not affect the serum ALT and HCV levels or liver damage in HCV-infected patients.

AB  - Clinical significance of TT virus (TTV) infection was investigated in Egyptian patients with chronic liver disease and volunteer blood donors by a cross sectional analysis. TTV DNA in serum was assessed by a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of TTV DNA did not differ among patients with chronic hepatitis B (11/24, 46%), chronic hepatitis C (22/72, 31%), or schistosomal liver disease (14/39, 36%). No difference in prevalence was found between blood donors (32/109, 29%) and each of the patient groups. Clinical background including mean age, sex distribution, history of blood transfusion, and mean level of alanine aminotransferase did not differ between TTV DNA-positive and -negative individuals in any of the study groups. Ultrasonographic evidence of liver cirrhosis was similar between TTV- positive and -negative patients in each of the chronic liver disease groups. TTV infection was not associated with hepatitis B or C virus infection in blood donors. The only significant difference observed was the lower concentration of serum HCV RNA in TTV DNA positive compared with negative patients with chronic hepatitis C (3.0 ± 1.4 vs. 4.0 ± 0.9 log copies/ml, P<.001). In conclusion, TTV infection was not associated with either past history of blood exposure or infection with bloodborne hepatitis viruses in Egypt. No clinical significance of TTV was found in the present study. However, a reciprocal interaction was suggested between TTV and HCV replication.

AB  - The prevalence rates of serum TT virus (TTV) DNA among children with or without a history of transfusion or liver disease were studied by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using either the Okamoto primer set or the Takahashi primer set developed more recently. Using Okamoto and Takahashi primer sets, the prevalence rates were 31.6% (12/38) and 78.9% (30/38), respectively, for children with a history of blood transfusion (including malignant and non- malignant groups) and 6.7% (2/30) and 60% (18/30), respectively, for children without a history of blood transfusion. Among pregnant women, these rates were 12.9% (4/31) and 61.3% (19/31), respectively. On the other hand, the prevalence rates were 0% (0/16) and 50% (8/16), respectively, in hepatitis B patients, 21.4% (3/14) and 71.4% (10/14), respectively, for hepatitis C patients, and 20.0% (9/45) and 57.8% (26/45), respectively, for non-A to C hepatitis patients (including 27 acute hepatitis patients, 5 fulminant patients and 13 chronic hepatitis patients). In this study, the prevalence rates determined by the Takahashi primer set tended to be 2-9 times higher than those determined using the Okamoto primer set. These results suggest that TTV infection is widespread among Japanese children. Furthermore, blood transfusion does not appear to be the major route of infection. The similar prevalence rates between control children and children with various types of hepatitis using the Takahashi primer system suggest that TTV infection does not play a direct causative role in the development of liver disease in children.

AB  - Background. A recently identified DNA transfusion-transmitted virus has been associated with post-transfusion non-A to G hepatitis. Aim. To determine the prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Its clinical role in the pathogenesis of liver disease was also evaluated in patients with transfusion-transmitted-virus hepatitis C virus coinfection compared with those with hepatitis C Virus infection alone. Patients and Methods. We evaluated 312 HIV-hepatitis C virus coinfected patients (225 males, 87 females). All underwent screening for transfusion-transmitted virus DNA using a nested polymerase chain reaction technique. In some transfusion transmitted virus-DNA positive patients, we performed a phylogenetic analysis. In 56 patients (20 transfusion-transmitted-virus-hepatitis C virus and 36 hepatitis C virus alone), liver biopsy was collected. Results. The prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus was 113/312 (36%). The genotype distribution was similar to that reported in other studies. No difference in liver histology was found between the two groups. Conclusion. Transfusion-transmitted virus infection is common in human immunodeficiency virus patients. We found no histologic differences between liver biopsy specimens from patients coinfected with transfusion-transmitted virus plus hepatitis C virus compared with those infected with hepatitis C virus alone. Transfusion-transmitted virus is not clearly associated with a distinct liver injury.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is the only known human virus with single-stranded circular DNA, with a possible but yet unclear relationship to chicken anemia virus (CAV) of the family Circoviridae. Here we report a new human virus resembling TTV and CAV, designated TTV-like mini virus (TLMV). This non-enveloped virus was smaller (&lt; 30 nm) but had a similar density (1.31-1.34 g/ml in CsCl) to TTV, when a TLMV/TTV-coinfected plasma was analyzed. Full-length sequencing revealed that the TLMV genome was a circular DNA comprising 2860 nt (isolate CBD231); significantly shorter than TTV (TA278, 3852 nt) but longer than CAV (CAECUX1, 2319 nt). A strand-specific hybridization assay using oligonucleotide-coated beads suggested TLMV was negative-stranded, like TTV and CAV. In genomic organization, TLMV was similar to both TTV and CAV. The untranslated region of TLMV resembled CAV in that both had direct repeats, whereas the sequence homology was more evident between TLMV and TTV. The predicted ORF1 protein of TLMV was rich in R/W/F residues at its amino terminus; the richness in W was shared by TTV, F by CAV, and R by both. ORF2 proteins of the three viruses had a common motif, WX7HX3CXCX5H. Thus, TLMV is an intermediate between the remotely related TTV and CAV. Since CAV differs much from other circoviruses, it may better be classified together with TTV and TLMV under a new family: we would coin the Paracircoviridae.

AB  - Background. The recent discovery of a new parenterally transmitted DNA virus called TT virus (TTV) led us to investigate its prevalence in haemodialysis patients, a high-risk group for blood-borne infection, and to evaluate its role in liver disease. Moreover, we compared the TTV prevalence with the prevalence of other hepatitis virus coinfections. Methods. Serum samples of 78 patients on maintenance haemodialysis were tested for TTV-DNA, hepatitis G virus (HGV)-RNA, anti-E2, anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) and HCV-RNA. TTV-DNA was detected by semi-nested PCR using the primers from open reading frame 1 (ORF). HGV-RNA was detected by PCR using specific primers for the NS3 and the 5'-UTR genome regions while anti-E2 were checked by an enzyme immunological test. Anti-HCV was tested by the second generation Chiron RIBA HCV test system. HCV-RNA was evaluated by nested PCR with primers directed to the highly conserved 5' non-coding region of the HCV genome. Results. TTV prevalence in our patients was 19% (15/78) while the prevalence of HCV and HGV infection proved to be 20 and 15.4%, respectively. Among TTV positive patients HGV co-infection was present in five cases (33%), HCV in six cases (39.9%), while HBV co-infection was not present in any of the patients. Only three patients proved positive for all three viruses. ALT levels were normal in most cases (13/15; 86%). In particular, patients with TTV infection alone showed normal ALT levels and HCV coinfection was found in the two patients with moderate ALT increases. Conclusions. TTV prevalence in haemodialysed patients is significant though the real clinical impact is still unclear. However, we must keep in mind that the epidemiological relevance of TTV infection is probably underestimated due to the impossibility in detecting the corresponding antibody.

AB  - Three new hepatitis viruses are reviewed; Hepatitis E Virus (HEV), Hepatitis G Virus (HGV), and Transfusion Transmitted Virus (TTV). Only HEV has been clearly associated with liver damage. It is transmitted by the fecal-oral route and tends to occur in poor socio-economic conditions. Acute disease is diagnosed by the presence of anti-HEV IgM antibodies in the serum. Hepatitis G virus and TTV are transmitted parenterally. HGV is the same agent as GBV-C. Although it is hepatotropic, and high levels of viremia may occur, pathogenicity to the liver has not been proven. TTV may also be transmitted by the fecal-oral route. It is abundant in liver tissue but, like HGV, pathogenicity has not been proven.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a common virus and consists of many genotypes and variants. In addition, there exists a virus which both differs greatly from and retains a considerable resemblance to TTV, such as the TTV-like mini virus (TLMV) as we reported previously. Here we report the near full length genomic sequences of 4 isolates of a new variant of TTV (designated YONBAN) along with the full length sequences of 2 isolates of the TTV-SANBAN lineage and 7 isolates of the TLMV species derived from human sera. The TTV-YONBAN sequences showed only about 50% identity at the nucleotide level to those of the prototype TTV (TA278) and to SANBAN, and even less to TLMV. Moreover, the ORF1 of YONBAN lacked the ATG initiation codon which is shared by all the TTV and TLMV isolates so far identified in humans; instead, YONBAN had a Kozak's rule-compatible ACG codon as the candidate initiation site for the ORF1 translation. Nevertheless, the overall genetic structure and the conserved amino acid motifs within the ORF1 and the ORF2 were well shared among the prototype TTV strains, the SANBAN and YONBAN variants, and TLMV. The most conserved nucleotide sequence was found in the noncoding region just upstream from the ORF2, allowing construction of a phylogenetic tree which implied that the TTV genotypes and variants, the TLMV, and chicken anemia virus could be coclassified under a superfamily for which we proposed the name of 'Paracircoviridae' in our previous report.

TTV has a particle size of 30-50 nm and possesses a single-strand circular DNA. Epidemiologic data are derived from studies looking for the viral DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Important differences between early and recent studies appear to be due to the use of PCR assays based on primers located in different regions of the genome. Based on the most recent studies, the prevalence of TTV infections seems very high in the general population. TTV is present in the feces and would be transmitted through the fecal-oral route. It appears to be a ubiquitous virus, also present in various animal species, from chickens to chimpanzees. No association to any pathology has been identified so far, and TTV infection does not have a significant effect on liver disease. (C) 2000 Editions scientifiques et medicales Elsevier SAS.

AB  - Little is known about the natural history and the pathogenicity of the TT virus (TTV). We present our findings of a cross-sectional study based on the TTV DNA screening of 173 multiple-transfused patients and a longitudinal study based on the follow-up of TTV DNA-positive patients. Overall, 48 patients (27.7%) tested positive for TTV DNA. The influence of the number of blood donor exposures on the prevalence of blood-borne viral infection indicates that TTV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), and an RNA virus known as GB virus C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV) share a parenteral transmission, but that TTV, in contrast to the 2 other viruses, is also transmitted by at least another efficient means. The patients having a well-defined date of TTV infection were positive for TTV DNA during a mean period of 3.1 years. A chronic infection was observed in 31 cases (86%). TTV carriage appeared clinically benign in all patients. No clinical evidence of a disease potentially linked to the TTV infection was observed in patients with TTV DNA carriage over several years. The majority of TTV carriers had no biochemical evidence of liver disease. The prevalence of elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was higher in the TTV DNA-positive group, even in the absence of HCV infection, but the observed peaks of ALT level were most often transient and very mild. The prevalence of TTV DNA observed in blood recipients is consistent with that of TTV infection observed in blood donors. TTV infection frequently tends to persist.

AB  - A novel TT virus (TTV)-like DNA sequence was detected in the serum of a patient (PM) with acute non-A-E hepatitis. The full-length genome sequence, referred to here as PM virus (PMV), was obtained and its relationship to other full or near full-length TTV sequences examined. Although it shares a common genomic arrangement and short conserved regions, the majority of the genome is extremely divergent, displaying an average genetic distance of 0·60 from all other TTV sequences. By comparing PMV with TTV genomes representing the most divergent types so far described, six major groups can be distinguished. The level of genetic diversity seen between these genomes is higher than would be expected within a single virus species. Indeed, PMV could be considered the prototype of an independent taxonomic group within the Circoviridae family. A genoprevalence study of sera from blood donors and patients with acute hepatitis suggests that PMV is rare.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) has not yet been cultured or visualized. We attempted to recover and visualize TTV-associated particles from the serum samples and feces of infected humans. Serum samples were obtained from 7 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients. Three patients had a high TTV DNA titer (108 copies/ml), three had a low TTV DNA titer (102 copies/ml), and one was negative for TTV DNA. Fecal supernatant was obtained from a different TTV-infected subject. The serum samples were fractionated by high-performance liquid chromatography, and TTV DNA-rich fractions were subjected to floatation ultracentrifugation in cesium chloride. Virus-like particles, 30-32 nm in diameter, were found in the 1.31-1.33 g/cm3 fractions from each of the three serum samples with high TTV DNA titer, but not in any fraction from the four serum samples that either were negative for TTV DNA or had low TTV DNA titer. The TTV particles formed aggregates of various sizes, and immunogold electron microscopy showed that they were bound to human immunoglobulin G. Similar virus-like particles with a diameter of 30-32 nm banding at 1.34-1.35 g/cm3 were visualized in fecal supernatant with TTV genotype 1a by immune electron microscopy using human plasma containing TTV genotype 1a-specific antibody. © 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly isolated DNA virus from the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology in 1997. To evaluate the clinical and molecular characteristics of TT virus (TTV) in a hepatitis C virus (HCV) and B (HBV) hyperendemic area (Masago), 200 residents were enrolled in the study. The sera were tested for alanine aminotransferase (ALT), HCV RNA and GB virus C/Hepatitis G virus (HGV) RNA, TTV DNA, HBsAg, anti-HCV and antibodies to HGV E2-protein (anti-E2). TTV DNA was positive in 99 of the 200 sera with a prevalence rate of 49.5%. The prevalence of HBsAg, anti-HCV, HCV RNA, HGV RNA, anti-E2 and HGV exposure (defined as positive for serum HGV RNA and/or anti-E2) was 38.9%, 69.5%, 64.5%, 17.0%, 25.5% and 39.5%, respectively. Neither clinical nor virological factors were associated with TTV viremia. The rate of ALT abnormality was significantly elevated in HCV RNA-positive (34.9%) than -negative (7.0%) residents (p < 0.001). HCV viremia was the only factor significantly associated with ALT elevation by multiple logistic regression (odds ratio: 6.96; 95% C.I.: 2.60-18.7). We concluded that in this HCV/HBV hyperendemic area, the prevalence of TTV DNA was high. No significant clinical factor was observed to be associated with TTV infection. TTV infection is not related to abnormal ALT levels and ALT abnormality was mainly attributable to HCV but not TTV, HBV or HGV infection.

AB  - A recently discovered DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), is prevalent in humans. In the present study, the genetic heterogeneity of TTV was evaluated in hepatitis C virus (HCV)-infected patients and in chimpanzees. TTV DNA was detected by PCR in serum samples from all ten HCV-infected patients studied; at least five major TTV genotypes, all previously identified in humans, were recovered. Eight patients were infected with multiple variants of TTV. TTV DNA was detected by PCR in serum samples from 11 (65%) of 17 naive chimpanzees bred in captivity; a persistent infection was present in three of six animals. At least five chimpanzees were infected with more than one TTV variant. Detection of TTV DNA in chimpanzee faecal samples suggests the possibility of faecal-oral transmission. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF1 sequences amplified from chimpanzees identified three major genotypes which had not previously been recognized in humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of the Rhesus monkey to the TT virus and to establish its transmission route. METHODS: Rhesus monkeys were administered orally and intravenously with the inoculum that was prepared with feces collected from a patient at the incubation period. Passage study was done with monkey' s positive feces. The blood, bile and feces were tested with polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the liver, the jejunum tissues with in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The viremia occurred 4-7 days after intravenous inoculation and 7-10 days after oral administration. The virus was also excreted in the feces in a few days after oral infection and simultaneously with viremia after intravenous inoculation. The virus was also detected in the bile during the viremic phase. There was a prolonged carrier state that the viremia and fecal virus excretion persisted for more than 6 months. No serum transaminase elevation was found during the infection. There were virus signals in hepatocytes in columnar epithelium and lamina propria cells of jejunum villi, but no significant pathology was demonstrated in both sites. CONCLUSIONS: The liver infection of Rhesus monkey was established hb either oral or parenteral virus Inoculation. The virus may be released from liver into blood and intestine vial the bile or just from the gut wall into feces, and hence it may be transmitted by both routes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain the complete TT virus genome from a Beijing isolate of China. METHODS: PCR was performed for amplifying the TT virus genome from serum of a patient with non A-G hepatitis. Five overlapped fragments, that are 199 bp (1-199), 1 267 bp (90-1356), 878 bp (1354-2231),1129 bp(2178-3306),'434 bp(3306-3739), respectively, were obtained. These PCR products were sequenced by standard method. RESULTS: The complete TT virus genome of Beijing isolate consists of 3 739 nucleotides involving two ORFs. The first ORF locates at 589-2902 nt, encoding 770 amino acids, the second ORF locates at 107-715 nt, encoding 202 amino acids. 5' and 3' terminus of the genome are non-coding regions including 106 bp and 837 bp respectively. In this genome, A is 31.2%, C 25.4%, G 22.5% and T 20.9%. The homology of Beijing isolate and Japanese TT virus was more than 95% at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. CONCLUSIONS: We successfully cloned and sequenced the complete TT virus genome from a Chinese patient. This Beijing TT virus isolate and that reported by Japan all belong to a same genotype.

AB  - A series of serum specimens obtained from two chimpanzees experimentally infected with hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis C virus, and hepatitis G/GB-C virus were tested for TT virus (TTV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). All PCR fragments obtained from both animals were directly sequenced, and the nucleotide sequences were compared to each other and to all known TTV sequences. This comparison showed that both animals were infected simultaneously with four new TTV variants designated A, M1, M2, and M3. One chimpanzee was found to be infected with TTV only after HAV inoculation, whereas the other animal was infected with TTV before any experimental procedure was performed. A set of PCR primers specific for these four new TTV variants was used to amplify TTV-like sequences from nine naive chimpanzees. None of these animals was infected with the prototype TTV variant. Two of these animals, however, were infected with one of the new TTV variants, while one animal was infected with an additional new TTV variant designated T. Among 99 hepatitis patients, 29 were found to be infected with the prototype TTV variant. None of these human specimens was found to be positive by PCR specific for TTV variants A, M1, M2, and M3. Similarly, not a single specimen from a smaller subset of human serum samples was found to be positive for the TTV variant T. Phylogenetic analysis performed on all known TTV sequences demonstrated that TTV can be classified into 13 different, yet closely related TTV species, designated as TTV-I for the prototype variant through TTV-XIII. The new variants M1 and M2 were classified as two different genotypes of TTV-VI, variant M3 was classified as TTV-VII, variant A was classified as TTV-VIII, and variant T was classified as TTV-IX. Thus, the data obtained in this study suggest that TTV represents a large swarm of TTV-like species, some of which have not been detected in humans and circulate predominantly among chimpanzees. © 2000 Academic Press.

AB  - Concomitant infection with TT virus and hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) is common. However, the effect of TTV infection on chronic hepatitis B or C is unknown. The prevalence of TTV infection, the effect of TTV infection on the clinical, histological and virological features of patients with chronic hepatitis B or C, and the influence of TTV infection on the HCV response to interferon alfa therapy were studied. A total of 100 asymptomatic hepatitis B surface antigen carriers, 220 patients with HBV-related chronic liver diseases, and 110 patients with chronic hepatitis C treated with interferon alfa (3 million units subcutaneously three times a week for 24 weeks) were enrolled. Serum HCV RNA and serum TTV DNA were detected by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum HBV DNA and serum HCV RNA level were quantified by branched DNA assays. Infection with TTV was detected in 21.5% of HBV carriers and 37% of HCV carriers. TTV infection had little effect on the clinicopathological course of chronic HBV infection. In chronic hepatitis C, clinical features, histological severity, serum HCV RNA levels, and the response to interferon alfa therapy did not differ between those with and without TTV infection. The loss of serum TTV DNA did not correlate with the biochemical response as did in the loss of serum HCV RNA. In conclusion, TTV infection is found frequently in patients with chronic hepatitis B or C in Taiwan; however, coinfection with TTV does not affect the clinicopathological course of chronic hepatitis B or C and the response to interferon alfa therapy.

AB  - The novel virus, TT virus (TTV), has been considered as a possible cause of cryptogenic liver disease, yet evidence of TTV prevalence in the general population continues to increase. To further investigate the prevalence of TTV, hair follicle and epidermal skin samples of healthy individuals were examined for the presence of TTV DNA, TTV DNA was observed in two out of 11 hair samples and four out of 11 skin samples. TTV DNA was also detected in 47% (17/36) of serum specimens from healthy individuals. All DNA positive specimens were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with a single primer set specific for the 5'-end region of the TTV genome. Amplicons from hair, skin and serum samples were sequenced and the percentage of divergence estimated by sequence alignment. The divergence of sequences present in different samples from the same individual (ranging from 81.76% to 93.71%) suggests that multiple strains of TTV may be present in each infected individual, with different tissues containing distinctive strains. Thus, TTV may subclinically infect various tissues of the body. These results suggest that TTV may be highly prevalent in the general population and thus may not be an epidemiologically important virus.

Enteric transmission is suggested as a route of transmission of TTV, with high prevalence of this virus infection in the general population, and age and geographical distributions of TTV prevalence very similar to those of Helicobacter pylori infection. We analysed an association between TTV and H. pylori infection in patients with gastroduodenal ulcer or ulcer scar. Methods: In 181 patients with a gastroduodenal ulcer or ulcer scar (102 with a gastric lesion, 60 with a duodenal lesion, and 19 with both sites involved), specimens were cultured for H. pylori and TTV infection was sought in serum by a polymerase chain reaction. Results: H. pylori infection was demonstrated in 152 patients (84.0%) and TTV was detected in 168 patients (92.8%). Patients with TTV were significantly older than those without TTV (P = 0.0001), while no age difference was observed between patients with and without H. pylori infection. No difference was apparent in the prevalence of TTV infection between patients with and without H. pylori infection, and vice versa. Conclusions: We found no association between TTV infection and H. pylori infection in patients with peptic ulcer diseases, which is consistent with a lack of association between TTV infection and peptic ulcer. However, larger studies including surveys of the general population will be required to analyse the overall association between TTV and H. pylori. © 2000 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.

AB  - A 17-year-old man was admitted to our hospital because of severe acute hepatitis. Serologic studies were negative for A, B, C and G hepatitis viruses. Later, he was found to be positive for transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) DNA. He was discharged after normalization of liver function tests. Four months after the onset of hepatitis, he was readmitted because of pancytopenia. Bone marrow findings were consistent with aplastic anemia. The anemia responded to steroid therapy. In this case, TTV was probably involved in the development of aplastic anemia.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study wether the nonenveloped DNA virus transmitted via blood transfusion is hepatotropic. METHODS: Total DNA was extracted from tissues of 5 experimentally infected Rhesus monkeys. A dot hybridization was done with virus double DNA strand probe or single antisense strand probe. RESULTS: Both single- and double-strand probes were hybridized with DNA of the liver, spleen, stomach, small intestine and colon. The virus was conformed present in most of all the organs when double-strand probe was used. The positive was noted only in the liver and small intestine when single-strand antisense probe was used, which showed that in liver and small intestine might have replicative intermediates of the virus. CONCLUSION: It suggests that nonenveloped DNA virus replicate in the liver and small intestine, so it might be hepatotropic.

AB  - In 1997 TTV was detected using representational difference analysis (RDA) in serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis unrelated to known hepatitis viruses. The genome of TTV is a circular single-stranded DNA molecule of 3852 nt with negative polarity. TTV possibly can be grouped either into the existing family Circoviridae or into a recently established virus family ‘Circinoviridae’. Analysis of the complete DNA nucleotide sequence of TTV identified three partially overlapping open reading frames (ORFs). Neither DNA nucleotide nor corresponding amino acid sequences of TTV do show significant homologies to known sequences. TTV DNA nucleotide sequences amplified by PCR from sera of different patients show considerable sequence variations. Although the natural route of transmission of TTV is still unknown, there is clear evidence for a transmission of TTV through blood and blood products. TTV DNA can be detected in the feces of infected individuals suggesting that it may be possible to attract TTV infection from environmental sources. Since the discovery of TTV, numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of TTV infections in different human population groups all over the world. All these studies are based on PCR detection systems, but the technical aspects of the PCR systems vary significantly between the different investigators. The results of the epidemiological studies do not show a clear picture. The discovery of TTV as a viral agent and particularly the identification of a high percentage of infected carriers in the healthy human population raises the following questions: Firstly, what is the origin and molecular relatedness of TT virus. Secondly, what is the significance of TTV as a human pathogen. And thirdly, what are the exact molecular mechanisms of viral replication. To answer these questions it will be necessary to determine the primary structure and the coding capacity of several TTV patient isolates.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) has been identified in patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology and is thought to be a new hepatitis virus. We determined the extent of TTV infection in the Japanese general population and the relationship between TTV DNA genotype and liver damage. In 1998, we tested 847 serum samples for TTV. TTV DNA was assayed by a nested polymerase chain reaction and classified into three different genotypes and eight subtypes. TTV DNA was detected in 25.3% and 32.4% of the inhabitants of the two areas studied, respectively. The genotype distribution was similar in both areas. G1, G2, and G3 were 60%, 20%, and 5%, respectively. Of the 20 subjects with TTV DNA alone and elevated serum ALT levels, 18 were G1, one was G2, and one was G3. TTV infection is endemic in the Japanese general population studied. The main TTV genotype, G1, may be related to the ensuing liver damage.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis has been characterized as a member of the Circoviridae, a family of small DNA viruses with single-stranded circular genomes. TTV appeared to infect not only the serum and liver, but also the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). We investigated the prevalence of TTV DNA in human hematopoietic cells, based on 84 mononuclear cell samples obtained from the bone marrow or lymph nodes of patients with hematopoietic malignancies including leukemia, malignant lymphoma and aplastic anemia. Forty-nine (58.3%) out of the 84 samples were positive for TTV DNA with polymerase chain reaction analysis, which was almost similar to the frequency found in the patients' serum. Southern blot analyses using a 3.2-kb fragment derived from the TTV DNA, however, showed no evidence supporting the fact that the TTV genomes are integrated into the human hematopoietic cell genomes, thus suggesting their existence as episomal forms.

AB  - Background: In 1997 a new human hepatotropic virus, TT virus (TTV), was identified. The clinical significance of TT virus infection remains unclear. Objective: To undertake an initial evaluation of the genoprevalence of TTV DNA among health care workers in the United Kingdom. Setting: A UK dental hospital. Study design: The sera of 53 dental healthcare workers (9 dentists, 14 dental nurses and 30 office staff) were tested for the presence of TTV DNA using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Results: TT virus DNA was detected in 3 out of 53 (5.7%) samples. This frequency of TTV carriage is similar to that of blood donors and healthy persons in the UK. Conclusion: The present data suggest that dental healthcare workers in the UK are not at increased risk of nosocomial acquisition of TT virus. © British Dental Journal 2000.

AB  - Background: The TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified human DNA virus and little is known about its non-parenteral transmission. The aim of the present study was to explore the prevalence of TTV infection in spouses of index cases and the related risk factors. Methods: Serum TTV-DNA was studied in spouses of 41 subjects with TT viremia. For couples in which both husband and wife had TT viremia, nucleotide sequences of the open reading frame-1 region were analyzed by phylogenetic tree constructions. Results: Three (7%) of 41 spouses were positive for TTV-DNA. No differences were noted between index patients with seropositive spouses and those without seropositive spouses with regard to clinical characteristics, including parenteral risk factors and exposure duration. Nucleotide sequence comparison and phylogenetic tree analysis of the viral genome in three TTV-infected couples revealed the isolates to be closely related in two, with a homology of 97 and 98%, respectively. Conclusions: These results suggest that interspousal transmission of TTV does occur; however, the efficiency of transmission is low compared with hepatitis C virus and GB virus-C. There are no apparent risk factors for transmission between spouses and further studies are needed to clarify other modes of non-parenteral transmission. (C) 2000 Blackwell Science Asia Pty Ltd.

AB  - Background/Aim: A novel DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), was recently identified in patients with post-transfusion non-A-G hepatitis. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical significance of TTV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Methods: We analyzed pretreatment serum samples from 171 United States and European patients who relapsed after interferon-a treatment and were recruited into an interferon-α-2b/ribavirin combination treatment trial. TTV DNA was detected by PCR using two different set of primers (TTV-A and TTV-B) derived from open reading frames 1 and 2, respectively. Results: TTV was detected in 29.2% of the patients with the TTV-A primer set, 70.8% with the TTV-B primer-set, and 72.5% if positive by either/both sets of the primers. The amplicons generated by primer set A were sequenced and a phylogenetic tree was constructed. The 50 isolates belonged to group 1a (n=8), 1b (n=17), 2a (n=21), 2b (n=3), and 4 (n=1). There was no difference in demographic (age, sex distribution, estimated duration of HCV infection), biochemical (serum ALT levels), virologic (serum HCV RNA levels, HCV genotype distribution), or histologic scores, and their subsequent response to either interferon-α-2b or interferon-α-2b/ribavirin combination treatment. Conclusions: The prevalence of TTV infection reported previously may have been significantly underestimated, based on the primers originally described and used by most studies. Although TTV infection is very common in patients with chronic HCV infection, it has no identifiable clinical significance.

AB  - The distribution of Hepatitis GB-C/HG (GB-C/HG) and TT viruses (TTV) infections was investigated in selected populations from Gabon using Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) for anti-Envelop 2 (anti-E2) GBV-C/HGV antibodies. Among pregnant women, 29 of 229 (12.6%) were Hepatitis GB virus-C and Hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/ HGV) RNA positive (+) and 32 of 81 (39.5%) anti-E2 + versus 8 of 39 (20.5%) TTV DNA +. Among sickle cell anemia patients, 9.7% (3/31) were GBV-C/HGV RNA + versus 22.5% (7/31) TTV DNA +. For tuberculosis patients, the figures were 11.5% (4/35) and 0%. A study of hepatocellular carcinoma cases (n = 27) versus controls (n = 66) did not show significant differences for GBV-C/ HGV RNA (10.7% versus 12.1%) and TTV DNA (44.4% versus 30.3%). According to phylogenetic analysis, the 15 GBV-C/HGV strains investigated clustered in group 1, the most common in sub-Saharan Africa whereas TTV sequences (n = 4) mostly clustered in genotypes G1 and one close to genotype G3. In the Gabonese populations investigated, GBV-C/HGV and TTV infections were highly endemic. These data are consistent with the low pathogenicity of these agents.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the molecular epidemiology of transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection and its distribution in different populations in Shanxi Province and the gene types of the isolates. METHODS: TTV DNA in serum samples was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Partial gene of the strains from different populations were cloned and sequenced, and their gene types were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 24 cases with chronic hepatitis B, 31 cases with non A-G hepatitis, 53 cases of professional blood donors, 112 cases of healthy lying -in women, the positive rates of TTV DNA were 41.66%, 29.03%, 58.49% and 8.93%, respectively. TTV DNA in serum samples of 18 cases of 2 - 3 years old healthy children were negative and also were negative in umbilical cord blood of 10 cases of TTV DNA positive healthy lying-in woman. Sequence analysis of 4 isolated strains of Shanxi Province showed that the nucleotide identity among them were more than 90% and they all belonged to the same gene type (la) CONCLUSIONS: This study proved that TTV infection existed in Shanxi Province, TTV might be an important pathogen for non-A to G hepatitis. TTV often coinfected with hepatitis B virus and there were high rates of TTV infection in professional blood donors and in patients with chronic liver disease. The gene type of TTV in Shanxi province was la.

AB  - Background: The existence of a novel human virus, designated TT virus (TTV), has been reported in association with acute and chronic liver disease of unknown cause. Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence and clinical significance of TTV infection in childhood. Study design: Sera from 104 healthy children, 85 patients with chronic hepatitis B (HBV) and 29 with chronic hepatitis C (HCV), were tested by polymerase chain reaction with primers corresponding to conserved regions within a part of ORF 2. To characterize polymerase chain reaction products, TTV isolates from 15 subjects were directly sequenced. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 22 (21%) of 104 healthy children and in 55 (65%) of 85 and 20 (69%) of 29 HBV- and HCV-infected individuals, respectively. No significant difference was observed in aminotransferase levels of HBV- or HCV-infected patients with or without TTV coinfection. Sequence analysis showed a high degree of genetic heterogeneity between TTV isolates. Conclusions: A striking difference was found in the prevalence of TTV between healthy children and patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection (P < .0005). However, based on these results, TTV alone or as coinfection does not seem to cause or exacerbate liver damage in childhood.

AB  - To investigate the vertical transmission of the newly described TT virus (TTV), serum and breast milk samples from 46 women as well as sera from their 47 newborns were examined for the presence of TTv DNA by PCR. TTv DNA was detected in 47.8% (n = 22) of the women. All but one child born to these women were also viremic for TTv from the first sample onward. TTv DNA was found in 73.9% (n = 17) of the breast milk samples derived from TTv viremic mothers. The one TTV-negative child born to a viremic mother remained negative during follow-up, although it was breast-fed. Our data show that TTv is highly effectively transmitted from mothers to their children during pregnancy. Although the majority of breast milk samples from viremic mothers are positive by TTv PCR, there is no need to discourage women from breast- feeding, because most children are TTv viremic even before breast-feeding begins.

AB  - Although recent studies indicate a high prevalence (12-92%) of TT virus (TTV) DNA in sera of healthy Japanese individuals, there is a paucity of information regarding the route of transmission of this virus. Analyzing the nucleotide sequences of the existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers of TTV DNA, we developed a set of noble primers (HM-1) and looked for the prevalence of TTV DNA in sera from 39 normal healthy Japanese individuals using PCR. The existence of TTV DNA was also checked in saliva, urine, sweat, stool, and tears from 11 and in semen from 10 serum TTV-positive normal subjects. TTV DNA was detected in sera from 23 of 39 (59.0%) normal subjects. TTV DNA was also detected in saliva, stool, semen and tears from all cases with TTV-DNA-positive serum, but not in body fluids from subjects with TTV-DNA-negative serum. TTV DNA remained undetected in urine and sweat from all cases. Data from these experiments showing the existence of TTV DNA in different body fluids suggest that the high rates of prevalence of TTV among normal healthy subjects might be due to a possible fecal-oral, droplet, or sexual route of transmission of TTV.

AB  - Background: A novel virus named TT virus (TTV) has been isolated recently from patients with posttransfusional hepatitis of unknown etiology. The prevalence of TTV in several groups at risk has been reported, however, there is no information about the prevalence of TTV in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) without blood transfusions or hemodialysis antecedents. Objective: To study the incidence of TTV in serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of CAPD patients. Design: TTV DNA was detected by polymerase chain reaction, using primers from the open reading frames (ORF) 1 and 2, in serum and PBMC from 22 CAPD patients who had not received blood transfusions or hemodialysis therapy prior to CAPD. As controls, sera from 20 patients with chronic viral hepatitis (10 with HBV and 10 with HCV) and 20 healthy donors were included in the study. Results: TTV DNA was detected in the serum of 5 of 22 (22.7%) CAPD patients with both sets of primers. Four of the 5 (80%) patients with TTV DNA in their serum were TTV positive in their PBMC with primers from ORF1 and ORF2. Five of 20 (25%) patients with chronic viral hepatitis (2 patients with HBV and 3 with HCV) and 4 of 20 (20%) healthy donors were TTV DNA positive in serum. No relation was found between TTV infection and the underlying kidney disease, previous surgery, and abnormal alanine aminotranferase levels. Conclusion: We have found a relatively high prevalence of TTV that is similar to that found in healthy donors and in patients with chronic viral hepatitis.

AB  - A novel hepatitis-associated virus named TT virus (TTV) has been isolated. However, its hepatotropism has not been proven. We have retrospectively analyzed the presence of TTV-DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization in liver biopsies from 30 patients with liver disease (15 TTV-DNA-positive and 15 TTV-DNA-negative in serum), and prospectively in serum and liver from eight patients with normal liver histology. TTV-DNA was detected by PCR in the liver from the 15 patients with serum TTV-DNA and in serum and liver of two of the eight patients without liver disease. TTV-DNA titers in liver were 10 times higher than in serum, although no correlation between TTV-DNA titers in serum and liver were observed. In situ hybridization shows positive signals in the hepatocytes of the 17 patients infected by TTV but in none of the TTV-DNA-negative patients by PCR. No morphological changes were observed in the hepatocytes showing hybridization signals. The percentage of positive hepatocytes ranged from 2.1% to 30% and correlated with the TTV-DNA titers in liver (r = 0.54; P = 0.037). In conclusion, our results show that TTV is able to infect liver cells although they do not support a role for TTV in causing liver disease.

AB  - Background: The relationship between genotype 1 TT virus (TTV) infection and the status of chronic hepatitis C was studied. Methods: A total of 52 patients with chronic hepatitis C who were treated with interferon (IFN)-α were enrolled in the present study. Of those, 12 were infected with genotype 1 TTV and 40 were uninfected. Results: Clinical backgrounds, including mean age, sex, blood transfusion history, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level, and the results of liver biopsy did not differ between patients with and without genotype 1 TTV infection. The distribution of hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes did not differ between the two groups of patients, but TTV-infected patients tended to have a lower serum HCV-RNA level than uninfected patients (median (range) 26.0 (< 1-460) vs 135 (1.2-740) kilo copies/mL, respectively; P = 0.065). Patients with a sustained response of HCV to IFN-α were significantly more common in TTV-infected than -uninfected patients (58 vs 23%, respectively; P = 0.018). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that patients with a sustained response of HCV correlated significantly with the serum HCV-RNA level (P = 0.006), but not with the presence or absence of genotype 1 TTV infection (P = 0.161). Serum TTV-DNA decreased with IFN-α therapy in all 12 patient and remained negative in six patients even after treatment. There was no correlation between patients with a sustained response of HCV and the same of TTV. Serum ALT levels correlated with changes the status of HCV viremia, but not with changes in the status of TTV viremia. Conclusions: An opposing relationship between HCV and TTV proliferation was suggested, but coinfection with genotype 1 TTV did not affect the status of chronic hepatitis C.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the TTV- like mini virus (TLMV) infection in Chinese patients with non A-G hepatitis and to analyse sequence of 5' non-coding region (5'NCR)of TLMV. METHODS: TLMV DNA was detected by nested - PCR from 53 serum samples of non A-G hepatitis patients without TTV infection. PCR products were cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: TLMV DNA were positive in 37 of 53 patients (69.8%). The sequence of 5' NCR of 8 TLMV isolates was compared with that reported by Takahashi (GenBank Accession No. ab 026930-026931) and showed nucleotide identity between 64% - 83%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicated that TLMV infection is common in TTV negative patients with non A-G hepatitis. The 5' NCR sequence of TLMV showed a great degree of diversity. The pathogenicity of TLMV and its relationship to non A-G hepatitis need to be confirmed and further study is required.

AB  - We tested the sera of patients with non-A, non-B, non-C, non-G (non-A to -G) hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) for the presence of TT virus (TTV) DNA and clinicopathologically elucidated the relationship between TTV infection and hepatocarcinogenesis. The study cohort consisted of 19 patients with non-A to -G HCC. Detection of TTV DNA was performed by the nested polymerase chain reaction according to a previously published method. TTV DNA was detected in the sera of 9 (47.4%) of the 19 patients with non-A to -G HCC. The clinical background factors and blood biochemical parameters of the TTV-DNA-positive and -negative HCC patients did not significantly differ. Three TTV-DNA- positive and 2 TTV-DNA-negative patients underwent surgical resection of the HCC. The histological findings in the non-cancerous liver tissue of the TTV- DNA-positive and -negative patients did not significantly differ. In conclusion, TTV infection does not affect the features of non-A to -G HCC. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - Testing of the DNA of TT virus (TTV) was done with serum samples obtained from 191 persons working in a public hospital of the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. TTV DNA was detected by PCR in the sera of 125 (65.4%) individuals. PCR products were cloned, and sequences with a length of 159 bases surrounding the TATA signal region were determined for 100 clones derived from 31 individuals. One clone from each of 23 subjects was sequenced, while 7 to 19 clones from eight individuals were sequenced. None of the sera contained a vital sequence identical to that of any other individual. Phylogenetic analysis revealed the existence of a divergent TTV genotype possessing a single-base deletion at position 140. Among the eight persons for whom various sequences were analyzed, six were coinfected with between two and seven TTV strains belonging to different genotypes. The results suggest that coinfection with multiple TTV strains belonging to different genotypes is a common event in healthy Brazilian adults.

AB  - To investigate infection and sequence divergence of TT virus in various population, a nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay with primers from TTV ORF1 genome was used to detect serum TTV DNA. TTV DNAs from various population were cloned and sequenced. Six gene sequences derived from two patients with non-A through non-E and non-G hepatitis, a hepatitis patient with HBsAg, a normal blood donor, an intravenous drug user and a woman prostitute, were compared with known sequence of TTV isolate (N22) reported by Okamoto, Japan. The nucleotide homology were 96%-98% and the whole sequences belonged to la genotype. The data indicate that TTV DNA from various population in China might chiefly be la genotype. There is no correlation between genotype and disease transmission and development.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) in 107 hemodialysis patients and 100 healthy individuals. Sixteen percent of hemodialysis patients and 2% of the control population were TTV positive (P<0.001). Sex, time on dialysis, transfusions, and alanine aminotransferase levels were not related to the presence of TTV DNA. TTV was more frequent in patients 50 to 70 (12/51) years of age and persisted in the serum of six of nine patients 8 months later. TTV was found in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of all patients with chronic infection, and sequence variation was noted in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells of two patients. No relationship between TTV infection and hepatitis was observed. Viral persistence and nonparenteral transmission may be possible in patients on hemodialysis.

AB  - Objectives. To investigate the prevalence, persistence and genome heterogeneity of transfusion-transmitted (TTV) in HIV-1-infected patients, a group at high risk both of contracting blood-borne viruses and having viral persistence relating to immunodepression. Methods. Plasma samples from 238 HIV-1 seropositive subjects and 226 healthy blood donors were examined for TTV-DNA both by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using primers from the conserved regions in the N22 clone and PCR using primers deduced from the untranslated region (UTR). Direct DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterize 27 TTV isolates from HIV-1 patients or healthy controls. Results. Using PCR with the UTR primers, TTV DNA was detected in a very high percentage (> 80%) of samples both from HIV-1 seropositive subjects and from blood donors. Using PCR with N22 primers, shown to detect viral strains associated with hepatitis of unknown etiology, TTV DNA was found in 103 of 238 (43.3%) HIV-1-infected patients and in 22 of 226 (9.7%) blood donors. There was no difference in the prevalence of the TTV DNA in HIV seropositive subjects with regard to clinical features related to immunosuppression, markers of HCV infection or intravenous drug use; presence of TTV DNA was associated significantly only with male gender (P=0.003). Persistent or intermittent viremia was detected in plasma samples taken up over a period of 19 months in all (15 of 15) HIV-infected patients tested. Conclusions. The persistence and high frequency of infection detected by PCR with N22 primers in HIV-1 seropositive patients suggest that further clinical investigation of immunocompromised hosts will provide information to clarify the pathogenic role of TTV.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To establish a method for the detection of TT virus (TTV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-microplate hybridization and to find out various influential factors of the assay. METHODS: TTV DNA extracted by guanidinium thiocyanate was amplified by PCR, the PCR primers were pre-labeled with biotin. By conjugation of biotin with streptavidin, the amplified products were coated to the microplate well, and hybridized with FITC- probe simultaneously. After being reacted with Anti-Fluorescein POD, the products that contained FITC probe were coloured by TMB-H2O2 and then measured the optical density using a microplate reader at 450 nm wavelength. RESULTS: The optimal concentration of NaOH was 0.3 mol/L, and the optimal time of hybridization and enzymatic reaction was 60 minutes and 45 minutes, respectively. The results also showed that the positive rate of TTV infection in normal population, hepatitis A-G and hepatitis non A-G was 13.6%, 20.3% and 28.1%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Comparing the PCR-microplate hybridization with the electrophoresis assay, the former is simple, rapid, sensitive and specific and is expected to be a new technique instead of electrophoresis assay as a routine method for TTV DNA detection.

AB  - TT virus (TTV), isolated initially from a Japanese patient with hepatitis of unknown aetiology, has since been found to infect both healthy and diseased individuals and numerous prevalence studies have raised questions about its role in unexplained hepatitis. In order to determine the prevalence of ongoing TTV infection as well as resolved infection, a serological study was performed with a recombinant protein generated from the open reading frame 1 (ORF1) sequence isolated from a French patient infected by TTV. The C-terminal end of the ORF1 protein, containing a particularly hydrophilic region, was retained to be used as antigen to detect the presence of anti-TTV antibodies in serum samples by a Western blot analysis. For this purpose, the C-terminal ORF1 region was expressed in fusion with a hexahistidine tail in E. coli and purified by metal-chelate affinity chromatography. The serological screening of 70 human sera, including 30 patients with hepatitis of unknown aetiology, 3O blood donors and 10 healthy children, allowed the immune response of infected hosts to be identified by the detection of TTV-specific antibodies, with a very high prevalence of 98.6% in the human sera tested. In contrast, TTV DNA was detected by PCR in only 76.1% of the tested sera. The use of the ORF1 C-terminal recombinant protein thereby provided a diagnostic tool to follow the immune response of the host against TTV.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the distribution of TT virus (TTV) genotypes in the blood donors of Northern China. METHODS: TTV DNA was detected using nested-PCR and its PCR products were cloned into the pGEM-T vector for sequencing. The sequences were analysed using ClustalX and Neighbor joining programs. RESULTS: Nucleotide identity of the 12 strains of Chinese TTV isolated was 53%-95%. Nucleotide homology between the representatives of genotype 1a and 1b [TX011(O), TA278] and the 12 strains of TTV was 55%-94% and 55%-75%, respectively. Of the 12 Chinese TTV isolates, eight were classified as genotype 1b, three as unknown genotype X and one as unknown genotype Y, which accounted for 66.7%, 25% and 8.3%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: An exceptional degree of genetic heterogeneity was displayed in TTV nucleotide sequences and they could be, at least, classified as three genotypes. Genotype 1b may be the main prevalent genotype in blood donors of Northern China.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection rate in gravidas and parturients, and explore the route of maternal-fetal transmission. METHODS: TTV infection was detected by nest-polymerase chain reaction (n-PCR) in the serum of 60 healthy gravidas and parturientes. Once parturient infection was identified, the latices and the umbilical blood were examined for TTV infection as well. Meanwhile, a group of non-pregnant healthy women was tested as control. RESULTS: The infection rate of observation group was 28.33%, while in the control group it was 7.57%. The difference of the two groups was significant (P < 0.001). Of the TTV positive parturientes, TTV infection rate of their latices was 27.27%, but none of the umbilical blood samples showed TTV positive. CONCLUSIONS: The TTV infection rate of gravidas and parturientes is higher than that of non-pregnant healthy women. TTV can infect newborns through latices, however, there is no vertical maternal-fetal transmission.

AB  - Background/Aims: The prevalence and pathogenicity of TT virus, recently identified in patients with non A-non G post-transfusional hepatitis, are questioned. Methods: We investigated the impact of this new vital infection in a large series of patients with non A-non G, cryptogenic, non-viral and viral-related, acute and chronic liver diseases (n=577) and blood donors (n= 300). TTV DNA was detected in serum by heminested polymerase chain reaction. Phylogenetic analysis was performed in 13 isolates. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 6/25 and 15/127 patients with cryptogenic non A-non G acute and chronic liver disease, respectively. TTV DNA positive subjects with post- transfusional acute hepatitis scored negative before transfusion. TTV prevalence was increased in patients with cryptogenic non A-non G acute and chronic liver disease compared to blood donors (61300; p<0.001) and non- viral-related chronic liver diseases (6/137; p<0.05). TTV/HBV coinfection was frequently identified (35/147), but this was not the case for HCV-infected subjects (4177). Transaminase activity or liver histological score was not significantly increased among TTV positive, HBV infected or non A-non G patients. The HBV infection and Mediterranean origin were the risk factors associated with TTV infection. The majority of analysed sequences clustered in genotype 1 (8=1b; 3=1a). Two isolates showed homology to genotype 2. Conclusions: These results support the view that TTV is a widely spread infectious agent with a weak pathogenicity. It raises the possibility, however, that TTV might be implicated in a few cases of acute and chronic non A-non G hepatitis. TTV-DNA-analysed sequences are related to genotypes 1 and 2 described in Europe.

AB  - To date, the routes of mother-to-infant transmission of TT virus (TTV) have not been fully elucidated. The present study examines the detection rates of TTV DNA in the serum of pregnant Japanese women and in cord blood at the time of delivery, as well as in the saliva and breast milk of mothers one-month postpartum. Primers derived from the well-known translated region N22 (N22 system), as well as the untranslated region (UTR system) were used. The prevalence of TTV DNA in the serum of pregnant women was found to be 11.9% (19/ 160) using the N22 system and 72.4% (55/76) using the UTR system. No TTV DNA was detected in the cord blood samples (0/160) when the N22 system was used for detection but TTV DNA was detected in 11.8% (7/76) of samples studied with the UTR system. Using the N22 system, TTV DNA was not detected in breast milk, but was detected in saliva. However using the UTR system, TTV DNA was detected in both specimens. These results imply that some babies are vertically infected with TTV via cord blood at the time of delivery or via breast milk or saliva. However, further research is necessary to confirm this hypothesis. - polymerase chain reaction; pregnant women; horizontal route of transmission © 2000 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - The pathogenecity of the TT virus (TTV) especially during childhood remains obscure. We investigated the prevalence of TTV in 40 patients with non-A to C hepatic dysfunction (non-A to C hepatic dysfunction group). Five patients with fulminant hepatitis of unknown etiology were enrolled in this group. We also examined 380 children without a history of transfusion or liver disease (control group). Subsequently, the genotypes of TTV strains isolated were analyzed in terms of their nucleotide sequences including 222 bp in the open reading frame 1 region. The prevalence of serum TTV DNA was 10/40 (25%) in the non-A to C hepatic dysfunction group and 25/380 (7%) in the control group. Sixty-six percent (23/35) of all examined cases exhibited either genotype 1 or 2. However, assessment of genotype in the non-A to C hepatic dysfunction group (10 cases) revealed a higher prevalence of genotype 1 than of all other genotypes (80% vs. 20%). This result differed significantly from that of the control group (25 cases; 32% vs. 68%). Such overrepresentation of genotype 1 suggests that this type of TTV strain is associated with the development of hepatic dysfunction of unknown etiology in Japanese children. - non-A to C hepatic dysfunction; gene analysis; TTV ©2000 Tohoku University Medical Press.

AB  - A number of viruses may be transmitted by blood transfusion, the most important of these are HIV, human T-cell lymphotrophic retrovirus (HTLV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), and hepatitis C virus (HCV). A series of overlapping safety measures are in place and are being improved and supplemented continuously. As a result, the risk of transmission of these viruses in the USA has been reduced to between one and four per million blood components transfused.

AB  - The development of new technologies leads to the discovery of new viruses. For each of these new infectious agents relevance to transfusion needs to be assessed. The questions to be answered are transmissibility by transfusion, pathogenicity, prevalence in blood donors, persistence and the availability of screening assays. Since 1995, three new viruses have been identified and extensively studied. GB virus-C/hepatitis G virus (GBV-C/HGV), a relatively rare virus with some homology with and epidemiological features of HCV, was thought to be related to post-transfusion hepatitis but was proven to be unrelated to hepatitis and is still in search of a disease. Human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8) is a major factor in the pathogenesis of Kaposi's sarcoma and other tumours related to immunodeficiency. HHV-8 transmission by organ transplantation, but not by transfusion, has been demonstrated. The TT virus (TTV) is a ubiquitous virus infecting a very high proportion of humans in infancy. No clinical symptoms or pathogenicity is attached to TTV. To date, none of the emerging viruses have been proven relevant to transfusion. © 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.

AB  - The prevalence of TT virus (TTV) and its rate of transmission through transfusion were investigated to determine its possible hepatocarcinogenic role in non-B, non-C hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as compared with that in hepatitis B virus (HBV)- and hepatitis C virus (HCV)-positive HCC. Its transfection route in TTV-positive cases was also studied. Serum was positive for TTV in 77.8% (7/9) of HBV-positive, 36.4% (12/33) of HCV-positive, and 63.6% (7/11) of non-B, non-C cases of HCC. The rate of transmission through transfusion was 52.4% (11/21) in HBV-positive, 40.1% (61/152) in HCV-positive, 33.3% (2/6) in HBV+HCV-positive, and 40% (8/20) in non-B, non-C HCCs, while it was 48.3% (14/29) in TTV-positive and 39.3% (11/28) in TTV-negative cases. The association between TTV and HCC was limited, and the main route of infection of TTV was not through transfusion. Copyright (C) 2000 S. Karger AG, Basel.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified un-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus. Although TTV was initially thought to be a new hepatitis virus, it is still unclear whether it causes hepatitis. To clarify the natural history and pathogenesis of TTV infection, serial serum samples from patients with chronic hepatitis were analysed. TTV DNA was quantified by real-time detection polymerase chain reaction assay (RTD-PCR), which was adapted for TTV. Five patients with chronic hepatitis, 4 with hepatitis C and 1 with non-B-C, were studied. The study period ranged from 9 to 50 months. In 3 patients there were frequent increases in TTV DNA titres, but no concomitant elevation of the aminotransferase (ALT) levels. In 2 patients who were treated with interferon, the changes in TTV titres were not synchronized with those of the ALT levels. Thus, in cases of chronic hepatitis, no correlation was observed between the serum TTV DNA titres and the ALT levels.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the presence and replication of TTV DNA in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from hepatitis patients with TTV infection. METHODS: Nested-PCR (nPCR) was performed for detecting the TTV DNA from the sera, PBMCs and feces of 16 patients with non-A to non-G hepatitis in Beijing Ditan Hospital from Oct. 1997 to Oct. 1998. PBMC DNAs were aslo digested by mung bean nuclease and amplified by nPCR to clasify if TTV DNA was still positive. nPCR products of the sera, PBMCs and feces of 5 hepatitis patients with non-A to non-G hepatitis were cloned and sequenced. RESULTS: 14 of the 16 samples of PBMC and 5 of the 16 samples of the feces were TTV DNA positive. Two of the 14 samples of the PBMC were still positive after the digestion and amplification of the single-stand DNA. Sequence analysis showed that there was more than 95% nucleotide homology among the sequenced 5 clones (from the sera, PBMC and feces of the 5 patients) and reported AB008394 (from Japan) and AF079173 (from China). Virus loading of patients whose feces were positive by nPCR was obviously more than the patients with negative TTV DNA. CONCLUSION: TTV DNA can exist and replicate in the PBMC; the hepatocytes of patients with TTV infection are not the only place of TTV existence and replication.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To obtain the complete TT virus gene from a Chinese isolate. METHODS: Long-PCR was performed for amplifying the TTV gene from the serum of a Chinese with non-A to non-G hepatitis. Three overlapped DNA fragments were obtained, which contained 199 bp (1-199), 3 269 bp (38 approximately 3 306) and 434 bp (3 306 approximately 3 739) separately. These PCR products were sequenced by the standard method. RESULTS: The complete TTV gene (named as TTV CHN1) consisting of 3 739 nucleotides contained two ORFs. The first ORF located at 589 approximately 2 901 nt, coding 770 amino acids; the second located at 107 approximately 715 nt, coding 202 amino acids. In this genome, G is 22.25%, C 25.54%, A 31.26% and T 20.97%. The homology of Chinese and Japanese TTV genes was more than 94% at both nucleotide and amino acid levels. There exists a hyper-variation region (HVR) spanning at 1 380 approximately 1 800 bp. In this region, the HVR homology of Chinese and Japanese TTV genes was 88% and 81% at nucleotide and amino acid levels, respectively. CONCLUSION: Chinese and Japanese TTV isolates belong to the same genotype. There exists a hyper-variation region (HVR) spanning at 1 380 approximately 1 800 bp.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the role of blood transfusion in TT viral infection (TTV). Methods: We retrospectively studied serum samples from 192 transfusion recipients who underwent cardiovascular surgery and blood transfusion between July 1991 and June 1992. All patients had a follow-up every other week for at least 6 months after transfusion. Eighty recipients received blood before screening donors for hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV), and 112 recipients received screened blood. Recipients with alanine aminotransferase level > 2.5 times the upper normal limit were tested for serological markers for viral hepatitis A, B, C, G, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. TTV infection was defined by the positivity for serum TTV DNA using the polymerase chain reaction method. Results: Eleven and three patients, who received anti-HCV unscreened and screened blood, respectively, had serum ALT levels >90 IU/L. Five patients (HCV and TTV:1; HCV, HGV, and TTV:1; TTV:2; and CMV and TTV:1) were positive for TTV DNA, and four of them had sero-conversion of TTV DNA. Conclusion: TTV can be transmitted via blood transfusion. Two recipients infected by TTV alone may be associated with the hepatitis. However, whether TTV was the causal agent remains unsettled, and further studies are necessary to define the role of TTV infection in chronic hepatitis.

AB  - The safety of the blood supply is critical to many parts of modern medicine. In a time when prescriber's and the public's expectations are increasing, it is essential that transfusion services globally ensure the safety of the blood supply. There are, however, many threats to this safety, one being the appearance of new infectious agents. Such agents may be truly 'novel', or may be existing agents, known but not routinely screened for, posing a new or increased threat. However, before an agent is considered to be a true threat to blood safety it must be well characterized, and evidence must be presented that (i) transfusion transmission is a significant route of spread, and (ii) the agent causes significant clinical disease. If either of these criteria are not met, the question has to be asked as to whether the agent is truly a threat to blood safety.

AB  - The prevalence of the blood-borne TT virus (TTV) in Italian hemophiliacs treated with different preparations of factor VIII was determined. Of the 178 hemophilic patients (mean age, 29 years), TTV-DNA was found in 123 (69%), in comparison to 22 of 100 (22%) blood donors (P < .0001). Of the 123 patients who tested positive for TTV, significant numbers were also infected with human hepatitis viruses and/or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): 31% had TTV and hepatitis C virus (HCV), 22% had TTV, and at least 2 of the 4 known human blood-borne viruses tested, whereas 15% had TTV alone. The risk of acquiring TTV alone was only slightly higher in recipients of unmodified plasma factor concentrates (78%, odds ratio, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 5.79) than in patients treated with virus inactivated concentrates (67%), whereas the risk was significantly lower in recipients of recombinant factors (11%, odds ratio, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.52). Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated in 2 of 27 patients (7%) with TTV alone compared with 43 of 56 patients (77%) coinfected with TTV and HCV and compared with 16 of 21 patients (76%) with HCV alone. Taken together, these results indicate that TTV frequently infects Italian hemophiliacs treated with plasma-derived factor VIII concentrates, both unmodified and virus-inactivated. Our results do not suggest a causal effect of TTV on chronic liver disease in these patients.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is new hepatotropic (DNA) virus discovered by the end of 1997 by Japanese authors. This virus is found originally in patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. In Japan its prevalence ratio is approximating 60% in patients with chronic cryptogenic hepatitis and 'idiopathic' acute hepatitis in the USA and Europe prevalence appear to be lower. The diagnosis of TTV is based on genome amplification methodology using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This virus demonstrates high genome diversities which explaines its prolonged persistence. The vital pathogenecity investigations and TTV role in liver disease are incomplete and conflicting. It seems that TTV is another, but obscure hepatitis virus candidate in acute and chronic hepatitis, and in liver cancer.

AB  - TT virus (TTV), a recently discovered DNA virus, has been implicated as a cause of non-A to non-C posttransfusion hepatitis. The frequency of TTV in persons considered at high risk for sexual and parenteral infection was investigated (52 prostitutes, 81 homosexual men, 65 intravenous drug users) to assess its mode of transmission. TTV DNA was assayed by polymerase chain reaction using primers from conserved regions in the N22 clone. Viremia frequency was 4.5%-13.0% in study subjects, not significantly different from that in low-risk controls (2 [4.5%] of 44). The frequency of TTV viremia increased significantly with age (P = .018) but was not associated with human immunodeficiency virus coinfection. The low frequency of infection detected in both risk groups suggests that spread by sexual contact or by intravenous drug use is relatively inefficient and unlikely to account for the high prevalence of TTV observed worldwide.

AB  - © 1999 OPA (Overseas Publishers Association) N.V. Published by license under the Harwood Academic Publishers imprint. Diagnostic Approach and Treatment of Classic and Novel Viral Hepatitis and their Clinical Significance for Pédiatrie Patients Over the past decade the classic hepatitis alphabet was added some more hepatotrope viruses. By molecular biological means it was possible to explore the viral genome before the protein structure became elucidated. The most encouraging step was the identification of Non-A-Non-B hepatitis to be caused by hepatitis C virus. Furthermore hepatitis E virus, hepatitis G- and TT-virus have been detected. From the epidemiological point of view hepatitis B and C infections are most important. The structures and the molecular biological properties of the virions were and are intensively investigated. Even clinical informations have significantly increased. Numerous treatment studies with interferons and other agents have been published. Unfortunately, success has to be judged rather modest for both diseases. However, the single patient may profit by the treatment which is in fact not free from side effects. Nevertheless, interferon therapy is a real option for children with chronic hepatitis B or C and has to be thoroughly considered. Novel drugs as nucleosid analoga for hepatitis B and the combination of alpha-interferon and ribavirin for hepatitis C provide an optimistic outlook. Despite all progress over the last years many clinical and therapeutic issues remain unsolved and have to be addressed in the future.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered virus from a patient with post-transfusion hepatitis. We investigated the frequency and pathogenesis of TTV infection in children. A semi-nested PCR assay was used to amplify TTV-DNA in serum samples from 254 ambulatory children without liver disease, 20 with hepatitis of unknown etiology, and 18 transfusion recipients or hemophiliacs. In positive samples, TTV-DNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR using a fluorescent probe. We detected TTV-DNA in 20% of children with hepatitis of unknown etiology, which was not statistically different from the 23% prevalence in ambulatory children. In transfusion recipients or hemophiliacs, the frequency was higher (50%) than that in ambulatory children (P = 0.01). Among ambulatory children, TTV-DNA was frequently detected in children with acute gastroenteritis (36%). TTV-DNA was detected in 10% of the infants under 6 months old, and 20% of the children from 7 to 12 months old. The prevalence was constant after the age of 1 year; however, the copy number of TTV-DNA was significantly higher in children under 1 year of age (mean: 105.4 versus 103.8 copies/ml, P = 0.008). Finally, TTV-DNA was quantified serially in three children with chronic hepatitis who were positive for TTV-DNA. The presence or amount of TTV-DNA was unrelated to the serum alanine aminotransferase level. These results indicate that TTV infection is common in children. The larger quantity of TTV-DNA in infants and the high prevalence of TTV in children of all ages suggest that TTV may be transmitted in early childhood. Its relationship to hepatitis is doubtful in children.

AB  - A novel hepatitis-associated DNA virus, designated as transfusion- transmitted virus (TTV), was identified recently. We investigated the frequency of TTV viremia in hepatitis C virus (HCV) carriers on maintenance hemodialysis to determine whether TTV coinfection has any clinical relevance. The subjects were 50 hemodialysis patients who had been followed over 4 years after diagnosis of HCV infection. Stored serum samples derived from each patient every 12th month after enrollment were subjected to polymerase chain reaction to amplify TTV DNA and HCV RNA. At enrollment, TTV viremia was detected in 24 (48%) HCV-positive patients irrespective of the number of previous blood transfusions and the duration of hemodialysis. The presence of TTV viremia had no relation to serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, HCV viremic levels or HCV genotypes. After enrollment, HCV infection persisted in all patients over the 4-year follow-up period, whereas spontaneous resolution of TTV infection was observed in 7 (29%) of the 24 TTV viremic cases (annual rate 7.3%, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.8-25.5%). Evidence for TTV infection was found in 4 (15%) of the 26 TTV nonviremic patients (annual incidence 3.9%, 95% Cl 0.1-19.6%). The relationship between the ALT profile and TTV infection during follow up was not evident. Active TTV coinfection occurs frequently in HCV carriers undergoing hemodialysis but exerts no biochemical or virological influence on the underlying hepatitis C. Lack of disease association and the frequent spontaneous resolution of infection suggest that the clinical significance of TTV infection remains unclear.

AB  - We administered interferon (IFN) to two patients who had quadruple infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis G virus (HGV), and TT virus (TTV), a recently isolated novel DNA virus. Nine mega-units of natural alpha-IFN were administered daily during the first two weeks and thrice weekly during the following 22 weeks (total dose, 720 mega-units). In both cases, serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels decreased during IFN administration but increased thereafter. The concentrations of HCV, HIV, HGV, and TTV declined with the administration of IFN. However, the concentrations of these 4 viruses increased after the cessation of IFN with the except of TTV in patient 2 which disappeared during treatment and did not subsequently reappear. IFN reduced the concentrations of 4 viruses, in an apparently independent manner.

AB  - The pathogenic potential of the newly discovered TT virus (TTV) is currently a matter of conjecture. Its presence was investigated in the serum of 660 patients, by polymerase chain reaction. TTV was detected in 50% of 221 patients with unselected pathologies, and no significant differences related to age, sex, or organ disease were noted. TTV was present at a significantly higher rate in hemophiliacs (73%) and at lower rates in patients with cirrhosis (30%) and rheumatoid arthritis (28%). Patients with other liver diseases, systemic lupus erythematosus, or psoriasis or receiving hemodialysis had rates of infection similar to those in unselected patients. TTV-positive patients treated with interferon-α for underlying type C hepatitis showed no appreciable changes of TTV viremia levels. Type lb was by far the most frequent viral genotype (92%), followed by types 2c (5%) and 1a (3%).

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a novel viral agent, detected recently in non-A to E hepatitis cases. Little is known about its natural history or routes of transmission in childhood. For the detection of serum -TTV DNA, semi-nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out using TTV-specific primers and TTV nucleotide sequences were determined by the dideoxy chain-mediated termination method. Five of the 70 children studied (including 20 hepatitis B virus [HBV] carriers, 40 children born to HBV carrier mothers and 10 children born to hepatitis C virus [HCV] carrier mothers) had serum TTV DNA. Three of the 5 children had siblings (4 in total), so that a total of 9 children were studied to determine the time of initial serum TTV DNA detection. In the 8 seropositive children, the time of serum TTV DNA detection ranged from 6 to 14 months after birth, and TTV DNA persisted thereafter throughout the follow-up period. The TTV DNA-negative child was assessed most recently at 6 months of age. TTV DNA was detected in only 2 of the 4 mothers tested (families 2 and 3). When 271-bp TTV DNA fragments from each of the 8 children were sequenced, the degree of homology between siblings in families 1-3 was 100%, 99.5%, and 92.3%, respectively. The degree of homology between child- mother pairs of families 2 and 3 was 99.5-100% and 62.6-63.9%, respectively. The distribution of different TTV strains was consistent within families, except for family 3. None of the TTV-infected children had elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase or clinical signs of liver disease.

AB  - We studied the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) DNA in the general population of the eastern Taiwan aborigine villages, about 11% (34 of 317). There is no association between the presence of HBsAg and TTV DNA or between the presence of HCV RNA and TTV DNA. Therefore, the infection of HBV or HCV and the presence of TTV DNA appear to be independent from each other. The association between the presence of TTV DNA and the elevated alanine aminotransferase (and/or aspartate aminotransferase) activity was also investigated. The presence of TTV DNA was not found to be correlated with abnormal liver function (P = 0.574) when age, gender, and the presence of HBsAg, HCV RNA, and HGV RNA were all considered in the assay. The sequence homology of TTV DNA fragments between different isolates from Taiwan and N22 (the clone obtained from the original prototype strain) from Japan ranged from 84 to 97%. The recombinant protein encoded by the TTV DNA fragment corresponding to the open reading frame of N22 was expressed in E. coli successfully. However, no serum response against the recombinant protein was detected.

AB  - In 1997, a novel DNA virus was isolated from the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology in Japan, and it was named TT virus (TTV) after the initials of the index patient. TTV is a nonenveloped, single-stranded and circular DNA virus, and its entire sequence of ~ 3.9 kb has been determined. For being a DNA virus, TTV has a wide range of sequence divergence, allowing the classification into at least 16 genotypes separated by a sequence difference of > 30% from one another. The nucleotide sequence of the noncoding region of the TTV genome is conserved, whereas that of the coding region is highly variable. TTV strains with extremely high sequence divergence are common in the same individuals, thereby indicating a mixed infection of TTV strains of different genotypes. An association is found between hepatitis of unknown etiology and the TTV genotypes which are detectable by PCR with primers deduced from the N22 region (genotype 1) in the open reading frame 1 encoding the capsid protein. It would be important to select the primers for specific detection of the TTV genotypes associated with clinical diseases, to further evaluate the capacity of TTV to induce acute and chronic liver disease as well as extrahepatic manifestations.

AB  - We evaluated the characteristics and rate of infection with TT virus (TTV), a novel DNA virus, in Japanese haemophiliacs. TTV DNA was measured in 60 haemophiliacs by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. Co-infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis G virus (HGV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was also evaluated. In addition, the rate of detection of TTV DNA in blood products was evaluated. TTV DNA was detected in 35/60 haemophiliacs (58.3%). There were no differences in the backgrounds or characteristics between haemophiliacs with and without TTV infection, except for higher levels of IgG and IgM in patients with TTV infection. In patients infected with TTV of types other than type 1, which are rarely detected in Japan, the rate of co-infection with HCV of imported types was high: TTV of types other than type 1 in Japanese haemophiliacs were probably transmitted by imported blood products. TTV DNA was detected in over half of the blood products tested, but TTV DNA concentrations in these products were lower than in the serum of haemophiliacs.

AB  - We performed a case-control study to evaluate the association of a new human DNA virus named TT virus (TTV) with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We recruited 174 subjects hospitalized for HCC (84% males; mean age: 64 years) and 118 patients hospitalized for non-liver diseases in Brescia, northern Italy, as controls (94% males; mean age: 66 years). TTV DNA was found in serum by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 26 cases (15%) and 11 controls (9.3%) (P > .1). TTV group 2 infection was identified in 16 cases (61.5%) and 4 controls (36.4%) (P > .1) using a type-specific PCR method. Sequence analysis of 222 nt of TTV DNA demonstrated that the remaining 10 cases and 7 controls were all infected by group 1. The odds ratio (OR) for TTV-DNA positivity, adjusted for demographic variables, hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA, and heavy alcohol intake was 1.8 (95% CI: 0.7-4.8; P > .1). The OR did not change when the analysis was restricted to 14 HCC cases and 56 controls who were negative for each known risk factor for HCC (OR = 1.7; 95% CI: 0.8-4.0). TTV-DNA positivity was not associated with transfusion history. The prevalence of TTV DNA was higher among HCC cases positive for HBsAg (10 of 38 [26.3%]) than among those positive for HCV RNA (8 of 62 [12.9%]) or negative for hepatitis B virus (HBV), HCV, and hepatitis G virus (HGV) infections (5 of 62 [8.1%]) (P = .02). This study does not support the hypothesis of an association between TTV infection and HCC.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) has been proposed as the causative agent of non-A to E hepatitis. We studied the association between TTV viremia and biochemical evidence of hepatitis in blood donors and prospectively-followed patients. TTV was found in 7.5% of 402 donors and in 11.0% of 347 patients before transfusion. The rate of new TTV infections was 4.7% in 127 nontransfused, and 26.4% in 182 transfused patients (P <.0001). The risk of infection increased with the number of units transfused (P < .0001). The rate of new TTV infections in 13 patients with non-A to E hepatitis (23.2%) was almost identical to the rate in 124 patients who were transfused, but did not develop hepatitis (21.8%). Of 45 patients with acute hepatitis C, 40.0% were simultaneously infected with TTV. TTV did not worsen the biochemical severity (mean ALT: 537 in TTV+; 550 in TTV-) or persistence of hepatitis C. In non-A to E cases, the mean ALT was 182 in those TTV-positive and 302 in TTV- negatives. No consistent relationship between alanine transaminase level and TTV DNA level was observed in 4 patients with long-term, sequential samples. Of 21 viremic subjects, 67% cleared TTV within 5 years (38% in 1 year); 33% were viremic throughout follow-up extending to 22 years. We conclude that TTV is a very common, often persistent infection that is transmitted by transfusion and by undefined nosocomial routes. We found no association between TTV and non-A to E hepatitis and no effect of TTV on the severity or duration of coexistent hepatitis C. TTV may not be a primary hepatitis virus.

AB  - Recently, transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) was discovered to be a potential causative agent for non-A-E hepatitis. Little is known about the relation between TTV and the clinical courses of various types of acute viral hepatitis. One hundred twenty-five patients with acute vital hepatitis who were admitted to the Chiba University Hospital between 1984 and 1998 and 100 persons with normal liver function tests were tested for the presence of TTV in their sera. Serum samples were tested for TTV DNA and genotype by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). TTV DNA was detected in 15 of 35 patients (43%) with non-A-E hepatitis, 14 of 33 patients (42%) with hepatitis C, 8 of 28 patients (29%) with hepatitis A, 7 of 29 patients (24%) with hepatitis B, and 37 of 100 subjects with normal liver function tests (37%). The detection rate did not differ statistically between non-A-E hepatitis and hepatitis A, B, C, or controls. The distribution of TTV genotypes was similar in non-A-E, A, B, C types, and controls. The clinical characteristics of the acute illnesses were similar for patients with or without TTV in hepatitis non-A- E, A, B, or C. Although TTV was detected frequently in non-A-E acute hepatitis, no etiologic role for TTV could be established.

AB  - Our group has investigated 201 intravenous drug users for the presence of TTV DNA by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The majority of the individuals tested were male, their age ranging from 16 to 63 years, and the duration of intravenous drug use from one to 40 years. TTV DNA was present in 62 of the 201 IVDUs (30.8%) with its prevalence on the ascent between the age groups below 20 and those between 21 and 30 years, as well as between the groups below 60 and between 60 to 120 months' duration of drug intake, respectively. When tested again after 9 months, nine IVDU (23.7%) were found TTV negative by PCR hinting at potential immunological clearance. Our control group comprised 200 healthy blood donors, 7% of whom were found to harbor TTV DNA in an age-dependent fashion, as observed with the IVDU. From the liver function tests performed we could not detect any statistically significant difference regarding ALT elevation observed in TTV-positive compared with TTV-negative individuals. To date, TTV does not appear to cause any serious liver disease in the majority of cases examined.

AB  - BACKGROUND: An unenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus named TT virus has been found in association with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels in recipients of transfusions and has been detected frequently in patients with acute or chronic hepatitis of non-A to -G etiology in Japan. DNA of the TT virus was searched for in blood donors with or without elevated ALT levels. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 861 blood donors without previous transfusions and who were negative for markers of hepatitis B or C virus infection were tested. DNA of the TT virus was detected by polymerize chain reaction with hemi-nested primers. RESULTS: TT virus DNA was detected in 62 of 280 (22.1% [95% CI: 18.1-26.6]) donors with elevated ALT levels (mean ± SD, 89.3 ± 36.4 U/L; range, 61-301 U/L), which is significantly more frequently (p<0.02) than its detection in 91 of 581 (15.7% [95% CI: 13.2-18.4]) donors with normal ALT (≤45 U/L). The frequency of TT virus DNA increased with age, in donors with and without elevated ALT. CONCLUSION: The detection of TT virus DNA, at a frequency higher in donors with elevated ALT than in those without, strengthens the association of TT virus with non-A to -G hepatitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: The exact role of the novel hepatotropic TT virus regarding the etiology of viral hepatitis, as well as the progression towards chronic liver disease has as yet not been defined. Moreover, the contribution of TTV infection to the course of chronic hepatitis B or C virus infections also still awaits clarification. Hence, the aim of our study was to investigate the impact of TTV infection on clinical severity and histology of chronic liver disease originating from HBV and/or HCV infections in Thai patients concomitant with the determination of TTV's association with non-B, non-C chronic liver disease and compared to its prevalence among voluntary blood donors. METHODOLOGY: DNA was extracted from the sera collected from 115 hepatitis B patients, 41 hepatitis C, and 48 negative for either viral marker, who had all been diagnosed with chronic liver disease ranging from chronic hepatitis over cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. The sera obtained from 200 voluntary blood donors served as controls. TTV DNA was amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) employing primers derived from the genome's most conserved region. The PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis. Liver function tests were performed by means of a chemical analyzer. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 20% of the HBV-positive and 19.5% of the HCV-positive chronic liver disease patients. Within the group of patients seronegative for both viral markers, TTV was detected in 8.3%. Furthermore, its DNA was identified in 6.8% of the HCC patients and finally, in 7% of the blood donors. Yet, no significant differences between TTV infected and non-infected patients were found as to demographic data, assumed source of infection, biochemical abnormalities, or severity of liver histology. CONCLUSIONS: TTV appears to be highly prevalent on a worldwide scale but regarding etiology of and progression towards serious liver disease, its contribution seems to be minor if not altogether non-existent. Hence, regarding clarification of its clinical significance, further studies are certainly required.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is widely distributed, with high frequencies of viremia in South America, Central Africa, and Papua New Guinea. The incidence and timing of infection in children born in a rural area of the Democratic Republic of Congo was investigated. TTV viremia was detected in 61 (58%) of 105 women attending an antenatal clinic and in 36 (54%) of 68 infants. Most infants acquired the infection at ≥3 months postpartum. Surprisingly, TTV infection was detected in a large proportion of children with TTV-negative mothers (13 [43%] of 30). Nucleotide sequences of TTV-infected children were frequently epidemiologically unlinked to variants detected in the mother. These three aspects contrast with the maternal transmission of hepatitis G virus/GB virus C in this cohort and suggest an environmental source of TTV infection comparable to hepatitis A virus and other enterically transmitted infections.

AB  - Two overlapping sets of TT virus (TTV)-specific polymerase chain reaction primers were used to test for presence of TTV, which was found in approximately 10% of US volunteer blood donors, 13% of commercial blood donors, and 17% of intravenous drug abusers. The rate of TTV infection among US non-A, non-B, non-C, non-D, non-E hepatitis patients was only 2%. Among commercial blood donors and intravenous drug abusers, only 1%-3% of the TTV- positive individuals were coinfected with GB virus C (GBV-C), a parenterally transmitted virus. This suggests that GBV-C and TTV may have different routes of transmission. Comparison of the sensitivities of 2 TTV polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer sets showed that the majority of samples were detected with only 1 of the 2 sets. Therefore, previous studies in which only a single PCR primer pair was used may have significantly underestimated the true prevalence of TTV.

AB  - Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) represents the most common form of malignant tumor among males in Thailand, an area endemic for hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Various risk factors have been associated with the development of HCC, among them exposure to certain toxins, and infection with hepatitis viruses, in particular HBV, as well as HCV in areas non-endemic for HBV infection. To examine the association of hepatitis viruses with HCC, our group investigated 101 patients who had been clinically, mainly via alpha fetoprotein level, and/or histologically diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma. We also examined 200 voluntary blood donors as controls. All subjects underwent serological tests for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and anti-HCV with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) used for the detection of HBV and TT virus (TTV) DNA, and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR for the detection of HCV RNA and HGV RNA. Besides showing a clear preponderance of HCC among males, with a peak incidence the age group 51-70 years, the results obtained in the HCC patients demonstrated that the prevalence of HBV was 65%, four times that of HCV (17%), ten times that of HGV (6%). and seven times that of TTV (9%). In the controls, the prevalence of HBV was 0.5%, that of HCV, 0.5%; that of HGV, 5%; and that of TTV, 7%. These findings confirmed that hepatitis B virus was associated with the development of hepatocellular carcinoma among the Thai population, among whom case histories of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis have also been encountered quite frequently.

AB  - A novel DNA virus, TT-virus (TTV), was isolated from a post-transfusion hepatitis patient in Japan. The prevalence of TTV infection was investigated among patients with chronic liver disease and normal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) volunteers as controls in Mongolia. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was employed to detect TTV DNA using specific primers derived from open reading frame 1 (ORF1) of the TTV genome. Nucleotide sequences of samples positive for TTV DNA were determined. The sequences were analyzed by a molecular evolutionary method. Fifty (60.2%) hepatitis patients and 12 (42.9%) volunteers were positive for TTV DNA. The serum ALT levels did not differ significantly between patients with single TTV infection and without TTV, HBV and HCV infection. Similarly, the serum ALT levels did not differ significantly between controls with and without TTV infection. Dual infection of TTV with either HBV or HCV did not affect the ALT levels of hepatitis patients. The molecular evolutionary tree showed that TTV was a heterogeneous virus and all strains could be divided into three genotypes in Mongolia. A new genotype was identified that was distinct from those previously reported. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

AB  - To study the prevalence and clinical significance of TT virus (TTV) infection in hemodialysis patients, we tested for TTV DNA in serum, using the nested polymerase chain reaction. The prevalence of TTV DNA in 352 hemodialysis patients was 32%. significantly higher than that in 50 healthy blood donors (12%). The prevalence increased with age (P = 0.0098): it was 20% (22/110) in patients aged less than 49 years, 37% (69/188) in those aged 50-59 years, and 41% (22/ 54) in those aged over 70 years. Other clinical features and the prevalence of other hepatitis viral markers tested did not differ between patients with TTV DNA and those without it. The detection rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and hepatitis G virus (HGV) viremias increased with duration of hemodialysis and with the number of blood transfusion units, but the prevalence of TTV viremia did not. Twenty-nine of 91 patients followed for 5 years were initially positive for TTV DNA. Of these 29 patients, 17 (59%) carried this viremia for at least 5 years. Fourteen of the 62 patients (23%) who were initially negative for TTV DNA acquired TTV viremia. Serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were elevated in patients with HCV viremia but not in patients with HGV or TTV viremia. However, the mean ALT level in patients with all three viremias (HCV, HGV, and TTV) was significantly higher than that in patients with one or two of the viremias. More than 30% of the hemodialysis patients had TTV viremia and the carrier state was maintained for years. The hemodialysis procedures, including blood transfusion, did not seem to be crucial for the transmission of TTV. The pathogenic effects of TTV on hepatitis appear to be limited.

AB  - The recent isolation of a novel DNA virus from the serum of a Japanese patient (T.T.) has provided the latest possible candidate virus associated with cryptogenic hepatitis. In the present study, we report the complete nucleotide sequence of this virus (TTV) isolated from the serum of a West African. Based on PCR studies designed to amplify overlapping regions of the viral genome and sensitivity to digestion with mung bean nuclease, the vital genome is circular and negative stranded, and comprises 3,852 nt, which is 113 nt longer than the prototype isolate from Japan. Cesium chloride density gradient centrifugation demonstrated banding of the virus at 1.31-1.34 g/ml; filtration studies indicated that TTV had a particle size of 30-50 nm. These results suggest that the virus is similar to the Circoviridae, viruses known to infect plants and vertebrates (e.g, birds and swine); however, sequence similarity searches of available databases did not reveal identity between TTV and other viruses. Phylogenetic analyses of a 260-nt region from 151 globally distributed isolates demonstrated the existence of three major TTV genotypes. Several individuals at high risk for infection with parenterally transmitted viruses were infected with more than one genotype. There was no correlation between genotype and geographic origin. Finally, intravenous inoculation of TTV-positive human serum into chimpanzees demonstrated that TTV can be transmitted to primates; no biochemical or histological evidence for hepatitis was obtained. The distinct biophysical and molecular characteristics of TTV suggest that it is a member of a new family of viruses, which we have tentatively named the Circinoviridae.

AB  - A novel DNA virus designated TT virus (TTV) has been reported to be involved in the development of posttransfusion non-A-C hepatitis. We evaluated the frequency and natural course of TTV infection in a cohort of transfusion-dependent thalassemic patients in a 3-year follow-up study. Ninety-three serum hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody-negative patients (median age of 8 years; range, 0 to 25) from eight centers were studied. Of them, 34 (37%) had an abnormal alanine-aminotransferase (ALT) baseline pattern, and the other 12 (13%) showed ALT flare-ups during the follow-up. TTV DNA in patient sera collected at the time of enrollment and at the end of follow-up was determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In parallel, serum samples from 100 healthy blood donors were also tested. At baseline, 87 patient sera (93.5%) tested positive for the TTV DNA. Of these TTV DNA-positive patients, 84 (96.5%) remained viremic at the end of the study period. Of the 6 TTV DNA- negative patients, 3 acquired TTV infection during follow-up. However, no definite relation was observed between the results of TTV DNA determination and ALT patterns. TTV viremia was also detectable in 22% of blood donors. In conclusion, TTV infection is frequent and persistent among Italian transfusion-dependent patients. The high rate of viremia observed in healthy donors indicates that the parenteral route is not the only mode of TTV spread.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a nonenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus with little sequence homology to known viruses, and associated with elevated transaminase levels in the patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology. The DNA of TTV was detected, by semi-nested polymerase chain reaction, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from the 30 healthy individuals with circulating virus in plasma. A sequence of 222 bases was determined on 6-10 TTV DNA clones each from plasma and 6 clones each from PBMC from eight individuals selected at random from this group. TTV can be classified into genotypes separated by an evolutionary distance > 0.30, which can be divided further into subtypes separated by that of 0.15. Three individuals possessed two different TTV variants of distinct genotypes, with predominant genotypes different between plasma and PBMC. Another possessed TTV of the same genotype in both the plasma and PBMC, but clones with a subtype not seen in plasma were observed in PBMC. A third individual had TTV variants with or without a deletion mutation, and those with the deletion mutation abounded only in PBMC. The remaining three individuals were infected with TTV with the same sequence both in plasma and PBMC. These results indicate that TTV variants with phylogenetic differences could infect the same individual, and that some variants would have a predilection for PBMC. It remains to be seen, however, if TTV replicates in PBMC or whether it has been sequestered before its evolution in the host.

AB  - Serum TTV DNA was assayed in 140 native Indians and 40 members of the general population in Colombia to determine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) infection among Colombian native Indians. Of the 140 native Indians, 23 (16.4%) were positive for TTV DNA, compared to 4 (10.0%) of 40 from the general population (P = not significant). The prevalence of TTV DNA among native Indians was much higher than that of HBsAg and anti-HCV. Comparison of subjects with and without TTV DNA revealed no significant differences in all characteristics between the two groups. A phylogenetic tree, using the open reading frame 1 sequence (222 bp), indicated that the virus could be classified into four different genotypes, including three previously reported ones. The results show that TTV infection is common in Colombian native Indians without liver disease and also indicate the existence of a novel genotype of TTV.

AB  - A recent report has described the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel, single-stranded DNA virus, named TT Virus (TTV), which was present in the sera of Japanese patients with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology [Okamoto et al. (1998) Hepatology Research 10:1-16]. Using a nested polymerase chain reaction assay, sera from Brazilian patients with acute non A-C hepatitis and blood donors were examined for the presence of TTV DNA sequences. Thirty-seven of 52 (71%) patients with acute non A-C hepatitis and 45 of 72 (62%) blood donors were found to have TTV sequences in their sera. Such a high proportion in blood donors indicated that TTV infection is common in the general Brazilian population. Partial nucleotide sequences (326 bases in open reading frame 1) from seven isolates were determined. By phylogenetic analysis, four TTV strains were classified into the genomic subgroup G1a described previously. The three others belonged to subgroup G1b. Sequence homologies between strains belonging to a same subgroup were 92.9-99.1%, whereas homologies of 86.9-90.2% were calculated between isolates from different subgroups.

AB  - TT virus is a newly described agent infecting humans. Initially isolated from a patient (initials T.T.) with unexplained hepatitis, the virus has since been found in both normal and diseased individuals. In the present study, we utilized genomic-length sequences from distinct genotypes of TT virus to design PCR-based assays using conserved oligonucleotide primers from three independent regions of the virus genome. Each of the three assays was found to be superior to the PCR-based assays previously published. The most sensitive of the new assays was utilized to demonstrate the prevalence of TT virus to be at least 34.1% in volunteer blood donors, 39.6% in commercial blood donors, 59.6% in non-A-GB hepatitis cases, 81.7% in injectable drug users and 95.9% in haemophiliacs. In an attempt to identify a possible source of human infection, we found TT virus sequences to be present in 19% of chickens, 20% of pigs, 25% of cows and 30% of sheep. Sequence determination and phylogenetic analyses demonstrated that isolates from farm animals were not genetically distinct from those found in humans. This study clearly demonstrates that previously reported PCR assays dramatically underestimate the true prevalence of TT virus within the human population. Due to the high rate of infection in both blood donors and those with non-A-GB hepatitis, these results question the causal role of TT virus in cases of unexplained hepatitis. Further, it is possible that domesticated farm animals serve as a source of human infection.

AB  - Since the identification of TT virus, only one full-length and two near full-length sequences representing a single subtype of the virus have been reported. In order to understand further the nature of the TT virus genome, nine of the most divergent TT virus sequences have been extended to full-length or near full-length. Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that these sequences represent three distinct TT virus genotypes and two subtypes. A high degree of nucleotide sequence variability (approximately 30%) was observed across the genomes with several significantly more divergent regions. Three conserved ORFs were identified, none of which shared significant amino acid sequence identity to sequences present in public databases. Additionally, sequence motifs, such as those necessary for protein translation and for rolling circle replication, were found to be partially conserved between all TT virus isolates.

AB  - The TT virus (TTV) is a recently discovered DNA virus which was first identified in patients with non-A to -G hepatitis following blood transfusion. In this study, we tested 150 attendees of two hemodialysis (HD) units of the public hospitals of Marseilles, France, for the presence of TTV genome by using a PCR-based methodology. The overall prevalence of TTV viremia was 28% (compared to 5.3% in blood donors from the same region). We demonstrated the existence of chronic infections and superinfections by strains belonging to different genotypes. The prevalence of infection was higher in patients originating from Africa, in patients with previous blood transfusion or organ transplantation, in patients with antibody to hepatitis B core antigen, and in those with diabetes mellitus. A high prevalence of TTV infection (50%) was also observed in a population of patients with diabetes mellitus but without renal disease. No significant relationship was found between TTV viremia and hepatitis C virus or GB virus C, transaminases, age, sex, and duration of HD treatment. The PCR amplification products (located in open reading frame 1 of the TTV genome) were sequenced. These genomic sequences were submitted to phylogenetic analysis by using the Jukes-Cantor algorithm for distance determination and the neighbor-joining method for tree building. In several instances, sequences from viruses isolated in a HD unit were grouped in the same phylogenetic cluster. These results together with the different distribution of cases in the two HD units suggest there is vital transmission within each.

AB  - Background/Aims: Recently, a novel DNA virus was isolated from the serum of a patient with post-transfusion non-A-G hepatitis and named TT virus. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of TT virus infection in patients with sporadic acute hepatitis of unknown etiology. Methods: TT virus was investigated in the serum of 66 patients with sporadic acute hepatitis non-A-G and 50 healthy controls by semi-nested PCR with previously published primers. Results: TT virus was detected in 17 (26%) of the 66 patients with sporadic acute hepatitis non-A-G and in a slightly higher rate (34%, 17/50) in the control group. No significant differences in alanine aminotransferase or bilirubin concentrations were observed between the groups of patients with or without TT virus infection. Eighty per cent (12/15) of patients for whom follow up was possible had persistent viremia from 4 to 36 months, and 67% (8/12) of these patients had already normalized their levels of alanine aminotransferase. A phylogenetic tree constructed by the Neighbor Joining Method revealed that all isolates in this study were grouped within genotype 1a and 1b, without showing any association between genetic type and development of hepatic disease. Conclusions: Our results suggest that TT virus DNA is present not only in patients with sporadic acute hepatitis non- A-G but also in a large proportion of the general population. This virus was not likely to be the causative agent of hepatitis among the patients in this study.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly identified single-stranded DNA virus. We retrospectively analysed serum samples from sixteen patients, infected with both hepatitis C virus (HCV) and TTV, and who had been treated with interferon. An elevated serum alanine aminotransferase level after interferon was associated with persistence of HCV (abnormal in five of seven patients with persistence of HCV compared with normal in all nine patients who showed eradication of HCV) irrespective of persistence of TTV. Comparison of partial viral DNA nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic analysis showed that viral strains that had a high identity to the prototype virus were more resistant to interferon than those showing low nucleotide sequence identity. Although we observed no liver cell injury caused by persistent TTV infection, the mechanism(s) of TTV resistance to interferon should be further investigated for a better understanding of viral diseases and establishment of therapy.

AB  - Background: The search for the cause of chronic hepatitis among individuals with non-A to G hepatitis has led to the discovery of a post- transfusion hepatitis-related DNA virus, designated TT virus (TTV), which, based on viral sequences, belongs to a new virus family. The principal modes of infection with TTV are poorly understood, and its role in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection is unclear. Objective: To determine if injection drug use (IDU) and high-risk heterosexual activity (HRHA), principal modes of acquiring HIV1 infection, place individuals at greater risk of acquiring TTV. Methods: The authors analyzed DNA, extracted from sera or filter paper-blotted whole blood, obtained during August 1997 and June 1998 from 324 Vietnamese (148 male; 176 female), for TTV sequences by hot-start, heminested polymerase chain reaction. Results: Prevalence of TTV viremia was similar among individuals engaging in IDU or HRHA (23.4% vs. 20.2%; P > 0.5), with no age- or gender-specific differences. No association was found between TTV viremia and co-infection with HIV-1 or hepatitis C virus (HCV). Phylogenetic analysis of 30 TTV sequences revealed two distinct genotypes and four subtypes that did not segregate according to gender, HIV-1 and HCV risk behaviors, or geographic residence. Conclusions: Among HIV-1- or HCV-infected Vietnamese, who presumably acquired their infection by either the parenteral or nonparenteral route, the data indicate no clear association between acquisition of TTV infection and risk behavior for HIV1 or HCV infection, suggesting that the usual route of TTV transmission in Vietnam is other than parenteral or sexual.

AB  - Three hypervariable regions were identified in a central portion of open reading frame 1 of TT virus DNA, which codes for a putative capsid protein of 770 amino acids. TT virus circulates as quasispecies, with many amino acid substitutions in hypervariable regions, to evade immune surveillance of the hosts and to establish a persistent infection.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly described DNA virus of humans that exhibits an unusually high degree of genetic heterogeneity. We have performed extensive analysis of the TTV populations present in samples, taken over a period of 2 to 6 years, from three individuals with persistent TTV infection. TTV DNA titres estimated for sequential samples were found to be quite stable over the entire study period in two patients, but fluctuated considerably in the third. DNA sequence analysis revealed different genetic diversity among TTV populations from samples from the three patients. In one case, absolute sequence homogeneity was observed among samples over a 3 year period. In a second, a limited amount of heterogeneity was found, including one sequence exhibiting G→A hypermutation. TTV DNA sequences from the third patient exhibited quite remarkable genetic heterogeneity: evidence was found of seven distinct infecting viruses, representing four of the six TTV genotypes that have been described. In addition, minor variants of three of these seven sequences were observed. The heterogeneity of the viral population in this individual declined steadily over a 6 year period. This patient infected with a genetically diverse TTV population had the highest viral DNA titre.

AB  - Background: Prevalence of transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV) infection among blood donors and in patients with liver diseases in China was studied. Methods: DNA was extracted from serum and amplified by seminested polymerase chain reaction with reported primer sets from a conserved region of the TTV genome. Results: TT Virus DNA was detected in 55 of 196 blood donors (28%); 31% (40 of 127) in the north and 22% (15 of 69) in the south. TT Virus DNA was also detected in 14 of 31 patients (45%) with non-A-non-G fulminant hepatitis and in eight of 25 patients (32%) with non-A-non-G chronic hepatitis. The rate of TTV viraemia in these patients with liver disease was comparable to that in blood donors. TT Virus DNA sequencing of 12 isolates showed that the prevalence of genotype 2 was significantly higher than that reported in Japan (66.7 vs 2.6%, P < 0.001). Furthermore, genotyping assays based on restriction fragment length polymorphism were carried out on all 88 TTV DNA-positive samples. It was found that 42 isolates (47.7%) belonged to genotype 1 and 40 (45.5%) to genotype 2. It was of particular interest that the prevalence of genotype 1 in patients with non-A-non-G fulminant hepatitis was significantly higher than that in blood donors (10/14 vs 22/55, P < 0.05). Conclusions: The data indicate that TTV infection is common in China and that the pathogenic potential of TTV toward the liver (if any) may differ between genotypes.

AB  - The rate of infection with TT virus (TTV), a novel single-strand DNA virus was evaluated and the clinical and laboratory features in affected Japanese medical workers were analysed. TTV DNA was measured in 356 medical workers and in 150 age-matched controls using a semi-nested polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in 62 of 356 medical workers (17.4%). There were no differences in the prevalence of TTV infection between medical workers and controls (18.9%) and in the characteristics of medical workers with TTV infection and medical workers without it, except that the mean age of patients with TTV infection was higher than that of patients without TTV. The medical workers were drawn from three groups: medical doctors, nurses and clinical laboratory technicians. There was no statistically significant difference between the rate of TTV infection in the three groups. These findings suggest that the risk of TTV infection in medical workers is low and not related to liver dysfunction.

AB  - TT virus (TTV) is a newly discovered DNA virus originally classified as a member of the Parvoviridae. TTV is transmitted by blood transfusion where it has been reported to be associated with mild post-transfusion hepatitis. TTV can cause persistent infection, and is widely distributed geographically; we recently reported extremely high prevalences of viraemia in individuals living in tropical countries (e.g. 74% in Papua New Guinea, 83% in Gambia). In the current study we have compared nucleotide sequences from the N22 region of TTV (222 bases) detected in eight widely dispersed human populations. Some variants of TTV, previously classified as genotypes 1a, 1b and 2, were widely distributed throughout the world, while others, such as a novel subtype of type 1 in Papua New Guinea, were confined to a single geographical area. Five of the 122 sequences obtained in this study (from Gambia, Nigeria, Papua New Guinea, Brazil and Ecuador) could not be classified as types 1, 2 or 3, with the variant from Brazil displaying only 46-50% nucleotide (32-35% amino acid) sequence similarity to other variants. This study provides an indication of the extreme sequence diversity of TTV, a characteristic which is untypical of parvoviruses.

AB  - Background: To examine the prevalence of TT virus (TTV) before and after blood transfusion, we retrospectively examined serum samples obtained from 55 patients who received blood transfusions before, during and after resection of hepatocellular carcinoma. Methods: TT virus DNA was extracted from serum samples and detected by nested polymerase chain reaction. Before transfusion, seven (12.7%) were positive for TTV. Patients were transfused whole blood or separated blood components (fresh frozen plasma, platelet and/or red blood cells), the total amount of transfused fresh frozen plasma ranging from 12 to 271 (median 38) units. Results: Seven (14.6%) of the 48 TTV-negative patients became positive for TTV-DNA 1 month after transfusion. Only one of the seven patients, who was already positive for HCV-RNA, exhibited elevation of alanine aminotransferase. Five of the newly infected seven patients become negative for TTV during a 2 year follow up. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the proportion of patients with TTV was relatively high in this sample, and that the prevalence of TTV transmission by blood components was also relatively high (14.6%). Although TTV persisted for more than 6 months in some patients, infection was not noticeable during the course of chronic liver disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the significance of the new DNA virus (TTV) infection in persons with elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) during routine medical check up and patients with liver diseases, and analyze its pathogenesis. METHODS: PCR was used in the detection of TTV DNA in 19 serum samples from ALT elevated persons and 41 from ALT normal persons during their routine medical check up, and 182 serum samples from patients with various kinds of liver diseases. PCR products were confirmed by RFLP. Other hepatitis viruses were simultaneously detected using routine methods. RESULTS: TTV DNA was detected in 10.53% (2/19) and 2.44% (1/41) in groups of ALT elevated and control respectively with no significant difference between their detective rates (P > 0.05). There were 9 cases with current HBV infection, 1 case with hepatitis C and 1 case with hepatitis A in group of elevated ALT. Two TTV positive cases were both superinfected with HBV. The detecting rate of TTV DNA in patients with liver diseases was 4.4%. Only one case out of 18 non A to G hepatitis showed TTV DNA in serum. CONCLUSION: There were TTV infections in Chinese population. The main cause for ALT elevation in persons during routine medical check up was HBV infection. There were TTV infections in patients with liver diseases too. However, TTV wasn't the main cause of non A to G hepatitis. Thus, the pathogenesis of TTV might be very weak.

AB  - Sera from French in-patients were tested for the presence of the TT virus (TTV) genome using PCR and degenerate primers located in ORF1. Thirty-six sequences were determined and compared with those deposited in databases, revealing a high degree of genetic variability between TTV isolates (up to 47% for amino acid sequences). Phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the existence of three main groups corresponding to the previously described genotypes 1 and 2 and to a new genotype 3. Isolates could be assigned to distinct genotypes if their genetic distance was > 27%. No comparable genetic criteria were found for the definition of sub-types in the region studied. A 15-31 month follow-up of three haemodialysis patients proved the existence of chronic infection by TTV. In one patient, two strains belonging to different genotypes were detected at the same time. Sequences of both ORF1 and ORF2 remained unchanged for a given strain during the follow-up.

AB  - Background/Aims: A non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus (TTV) was detected in Japanese patients with fulminant hepatitis (47%) and chronic liver disease of unknown etiology (46%) more frequently than in blood donors (12%). Subsequent studies, however, questioned the association of TTV with liver disease. We further investigated the role of this novel virus in liver diseases. Methods: We tested 106 patients and 102 blood donors for TTV by polymerase chain reaction using conserved region primers. Results: TTV DNA was found in 19 of 102 volunteer blood donors (18.6%) and in 27 of 106 patients with liver disease (25.5%): 10 of 28 chronic hepatitis B (35.7%), 9 of 28 chronic hepatitis C (32.1%) and 8 of 50 (16%) cryptogenic liver disease patients. Previous interferon treatment was not associated with a significantly lower prevalence of TTV infection. TTV prevalence was higher in patients with blood exposure (42.8%, 6/14) than in patients without risk factors (21.4%, 18/84). Four of five patients (80%) with HBV familial infection and without blood exposure were also TTV positive. Partial nucleotide sequences from 3 Italian isolates diverged more than 30% from the 2 prototype genotypes G1 and G2 and were 88% homologous to the recently described genotype G4. Conclusions: G1 and G2 TTV are common in Italy and in the USA in liver disease patients and in blood donors. The prevalence is high in patients with blood exposure but also in subjects without risk factors; other routes of transmission should therefore be considered.

AB  - To investigate transfusion transmitted virus (TTV) infection in the hepatitis patients and blood donors in Hunan, we used nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assay with primers from TTV genome to detect TTV DNA in seventy clinical hepatitis cases and forty-three blood donors. The results were as follows: TTV DNA was positive in ten of thirty eight patients with hepatitis B(26.3%), and twelve of thirty-two patients with non-A through non-E(37.5%). Elevated transaminase (ALT) was observed in those cases (452 U.L-1 and 582 U.L-1, respectively). On the other hand, TTV DNA was positive in four of forty-three normal blood donors. The data indicate that infectious rates of TTV in hepatitis patients and blood donors in Hunan are similar to those in Japan, and TTV's pathogenicity needs further study.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The TT virus (TTV) is a novel DNA virus that has recently been identified. The clinical significance of TTV infection in patients with chronic hepatitis C has not been determined. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and possible role of TTV in a well characterized population with chronic hepatitis C infection. METHODS: Ninety patients with chronic HCV and known time of HCV acquisition were selected from approximately 250 patients followed at our institution. Characteristics including age, sex, histology, and length of disease were recorded. Direct sequencing of the NS5 region was used for HCV genotyping. TTV DNA detection was based on PCR. RESULTS: TTV infection was present in 24 of 90 (27%) HCV patients. Patients were divided into four groups based on stage of disease; chronic hepatitis (CH, 29 patients), compensated cirrhosis (CC, 17 patients), decompensated cirrhosis (DC, 28 patients), and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, 16 patients). TTV was present in 2/29 (7%), 2/17 (12%), 11/28 (39%), and 9/16 (56%) in those with CAH, CC, DC, and HCC respectively. TTV was significantly more prevalent among those with advanced disease (DC and HCC) compared to those with stable disease (CH and CC; p = 0.001). Mean age, sex, and the time from exposure to HCV to development of complications were similar in TTV- positive and -negative patients. TTV infection was more common in patients infected with HCV genotype 1b. Univariate analysis showed that length of HCV infection, HCV genotype 1b, and TTV infection were important in predicting the stage of liver disease in HCV patients. However, after adjusting for length of HCV infection, TTV but not HCV genotype was important in predicting the stage of liver disease. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that 1) TTV infection is common in patients with chronic HCV; 2) TTV infection is more prevalent among patients with advanced HCV-associated liver disease (DC and HCC) than in those with stable disease (CH and CC); and 3) TTV infection is more common in patients with HCV genotype 1b but is independent from genotype in predicting the stage of HCV-associated liver disease.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the TTV infection occurs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of patients with chronic hepatitis B (of medium degree) and in HBsAg positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). METHODS: TTV DNA in PBMCs was detected by nested-polymerase chain reaction(PCR) and in situ hybridization (ISH). RESULTS: 7 of 26 cases of chronic hepatitis B were positive for TTV DNA by nested-PCR with a positive rate of 26.9% that was significantly higher than that of normal control(chi 2 = 14.3, P < 0.001); 4 of 21 HBsAg positive cases were positive for TTV DNA by nested-PCR with a positive rate of 19.0%, also significantly higher than that of normal control(chi 2 = 4.86, P < 0.05). 4 of 7 TTV positive patients with chronic hepatitis B tested by nested-PCR were positive for TTV DNA by ISH in PBMC cytoplasm, with a positive rate of 57.1%. CONCLUSION: (1) A higher incidence of TTV DNA in PBMCs of patients with chronic hepatitis B and in HBsAg positive HCC was identified by nested-PCR and ISH; (2) TTV DNA was in the cytoplasm of PBMCs in patients with chronic hepatitis B.

METHODS: TTV DNA in the serum was tested by nested PCR and the clinical data was analyzed. RESULTS: Infection rate of the TTV in cryptogenic hepatitis was 38.6%. It was a sporadic disease, and involved mainly the adults, with no sexual difference. The symptoms were notable, often with jaundice, but the level of transaminase were elevated moderately. Histology revealed the portal area inflammation. If accompanied with other disease, the illness would be exacerbated. CONCLUSION: TTV would be accounted for part of the reason in patients with cryptogenic hepatitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To make clear the infection of TT virus(TTV) in patients of hemodialysis and bone marrow-transplantation and to evaluate the virulence. METHODS: The TTV infection were investigated in 37 cases of hemodialysis and 90 cases of bone marrow-transplantation by means of review method. RESULTS: The positive rate of TTV was 16.22% (6/37) in 37 cases of hemodialysis and 3.33% (3/90) in 90 cases of bone marrow-transplantation. The difference between them was significant(P < 0.01). Of the six TTV-positive patients, 5 had blood transfusion and 4 of them had bone marrow-transplantation. Infection of TTV had nothing to do with the infection of HBV and HCV. There were no significant differences in the results of liver function tests between TTV positive and TTV negative patients. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that blood transfusion might be one of the critical routes to transmit TTV. The virulence of TTV might be mild. Whether TTV is a hepatitis viral remains further study.

AB  - Background: In 1997 a new human virus, TTV, was identified. The clinical significance of the TTV infection, however, remains unknown. Objective: Establishment of the prevalence of TTV DNA in different population groups in Germany and the assessment of the possible clinical significance of TTV infection. Study design: Detection of the TTV DNA by PCR in blood donors, patients with end-stage liver disease, and multiple transfused patients with haemotological disorders. Results: TTV DNA was detected in 16 of 122 (13.1%) volunteer blood donors, in 34 of 77 (44.2%) patients with end-stage liver disease, and in 21 of 38 (55.3%) multiple transfused patients. There was no difference in the prevalence of the TTV DNA in end-stage liver disease patients with regard to sex, age, presence of HCV and HBV infection markers, and etiology of liver disease. Phylogenetic analysis of the amplified DNA fragments from 12 randomly selected TTV infected subjects demonstrated that in Germany at least two putative TTV genotypes and four subtypes are circulating. Conclusions: (i) TTV is widely spread in German population (ii) one of the possible ways of its transmission is blood transfusion; (iii) TTV infection most probably does not generally lead to the development of the end-stage liver disease.

AB  - Recently, a new single-stranded DNA virus, TT virus (TTV), was molecularly cloned from a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology, and its causal relationship to non-A-G hepatitis is being investigated. However, the only method to diagnose TTV infection has been polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the basis of very limited information on its genome. To improve diagnostic efficiency as well as to understand better the genetic characteristics of TTV, we determined a partial ~2.4-kb sequence of the TTV genome from eight Japanese isolates. The sequenced region covered a long open reading frame (ORF-L) coding for a protein of 768-770 amino acids, which was highly arginine-rich in its N-terminus and had three or four asparagine-linked glycosylation sites clustered in its central portion. Our eight sequences and the prototype TTV sequence (TA278) taken together, these Japanese isolates of TTV were classified under two distinct genotypes. Using PCR primers designed on the observed heterogeneity among separate isolates, we identified an extreme variant whose nucleotide similarity to other isolates was only about 65%. Comparison of the ORF-L-encoded protein of TTV with those of known single-stranded DNA viruses suggested a possibility that TTV might be related to chicken anemia virus belonging to the Circoviridae family rather than to the Parvoviridae.

AB  - Background. A newly described DNA virus, named transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), was recently detected with high prevalence in Japanese patients with fulminant hepatitis and chronic liver disease of unknown aetiology. We investigated the presence of this virus in patients with liver disease in the UK to find out whether TTV infection is associated with liver damage. Methods. We used semi-nested PCR to amplify TTV DNA from serum samples from 126 adults, of whom 72 were patients with a range of chronic liver diseases, 24 had spontaneous resolution of infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 30 were normal controls. Direct DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were used to characterise the TTV isolates. Findings. We detected TTV DNA in 18 (25%) of the 72 patients with chronic liver disease, which was not different from the 10% prevalence in normal controls (p = 0.15). The rate of TTV DNA was similar among patients with various liver diseases. The majority of TTV-positive cases had no biochemical or histological evidence of significant liver damage. TTV DNA sequencing of nine isolates showed the same genotypic groups as in Japan: three patients were infected with genotype 1, which showed 4% nucleotide divergence, and six patients were infected with genotype 2 with 15-27% divergence. Interpretation. The high prevalence of active TTV infection in the general population, both in the UK and in Japan, and the lack of significant liver damage, suggest that TTV, similar to hepatitis G virus (HGV), may be an example of a human virus with no clear disease association.

AB  - Background. A newly discovered DNA virus, transfusion-transmitted virus (TTV), has been implicated as a cause of post-transfusion hepatitis. We investigated the frequency of TTV viraemia in UK blood donors, and the extent to which TTV contaminates blood products such as factor VIII and IX clotting factors. We also investigated the possible aetiological role of TTV in cryptogenic fulminant hepatic failure (FHF). Methods. We extracted DNA from plasma of blood donors and patients with FHF, and from blood products (factor VIII and IX clotting-factor concentrates, immunoglobulin preparations). We detected TTV by PCR using primers from a conserved region in the TTV genome. Findings. TTV viraemia was detected in 19 (1.9%) of 1000 non-remunerated regular blood donors. Infection occurred more frequently in older donors (mean age 53 years), compared with the age prolife of donors infected with hepatitis C virus and other parenterally-transmitted viruses. TTV contamination was found in ten (56%) of 18 batches of factor VIII and IX concentrate manufactured from such non-remunerated donors, and in seven (44%) of 16 batches of commercially available products. Whereas solvent or detergent treatment had little effect on the detection of TTV in factor VIII and IX by PCR, this virucidal step seemed to inactivate TTV infectivity. TTV infection was detected in four (19%) of 21 patients with FHF; in three cases, infection was detected at the onset of disease and could thus not be excluded from its aetiology. Interpretation. TTV viraemia is frequent in the blood-donor population, and transmission of TTV through transfusion of blood components may have occurred extensively. Clinical assessment of infected donors and recipients of blood and blood products, and assessment of TTV's aetiological role in hepatic and extra-hepatic disease, are urgently needed.

AB  - Recently a novel DNA virus, designated TT virus (TTV), that possibly accounts for some of the cases of liver disease of unknown aetiology, was identified in Japanese patients. Using specific primer pairs for conserved regions, we detected TTV DNA by PCR in 16/84(19%) German patients awaiting orthotopic liver transplantation because of decompensated liver cirrhosis (of diverse causes); in 4/25 (16%) patients with non-A-G hepatitis; in 1/7 patients with autoimmune hepatitis; and in one intravenous drug user. Sequence analysis showed that in contrast to the findings in Japanese patients only about 37% of our TTV sequences belonged to genomic group 1 but about 58% belonged to group 2, including several sequences belonging to a further subgroup tentatively designated group 2c. Further studies to clarify whether the novel virus has hepatitis-inducing capacity or other clinical significance are needed.

AB  - The genomic DNA of a novel virus named TT virus (TTV), associated with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown etiology, was cloned from plasma of a blood donor with an elevated transaminase level but without serological markers of known hepatitis viruses, and its sequence of 3739 bases was determined. TTV had a density of 1.26 g/cm3 in sucrose, which did not change after the treatment with Tween 80. The viral genome was sensitive to DNase I and Mung Bean Nuclease. Hence, TTV would be an unenveloped, single-stranded DNA virus. Two possible open reading frames in different frames were identified, capable of encoding 770 and 202 amino acids, respectively. When a partial sequence of 356 bases was compared among TTV isolates from 78 sera from blood donors and hepatitis patients, it showed considerable divergence with differences of up to 30%. Oligonucleotide primers were designed on two well-conserved regions for the detection of TTV DNA in serum and biopsied liver tissues by polymerase chain reaction. TTV DNA was detected in sera from 9 of 19 (47%) patients with fulminant hepatitis and 41 of 90 (46%) patients with chronic liver disease of unknown etiology. TTV DNA was detected in liver tissues of all the five patients tested in titers equal or 10-100 times higher than those in the corresponding sera. These results indicate that TTV would be responsible for a part of acute and chronic liver disease of unknown etiology.

AB  - Recently a new human virus, TT virus (TTV) was identified in the serum of a patient with posttransfusion hepatitis of unknown aetiology. Comparative sequence analysis of a 222 nt fragment of ORF1 of TTV was performed to assess the genomic variability of this virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the nucleotide sequences of 76 TTV isolates collected in 17 countries segregated them into two major groups: TTV 1 and TTV 2. The TTV 1 group comprised two distinct subgroups, which corresponded to previously described TTV subtypes 1a and 1b. The TTV 2 group was separated into four main branches, two of which included sequences previously provisionally attributed as TTV types 2 and 3. Bootstrap resampling, however, did not support the reliability of this grouping, suggesting that the isolates in the TTV 2 group should be considered as subtypes of a single type rather than different TTV types.

AB  - The novel hepatitis TT virus first described by a Japanese group has been reported to be parenterally transmitted and furthermore, to have been detected in patients with hepatitis of unknown etiology. Hence, in the present study its prevalence was investigated within groups at high risk for contracting blood-borne viruses, such as individuals with chronic liver disease, intravenous drug users and recipients of blood and blood products, as compared to voluntary blood donors and pregnant women. To that end, DNA was extracted from sera obtained from the respective patients and subjected to PCR using semi-nested primers. The frequency of TTV DNA detected within high risk groups, such as nine out of 50 patients with chronic non-A-to-G liver disease (18%), nine out of 98 hepatocellular carcinoma cases (9.2%), 17 out of 52 intravenous drug users (32.7%), 15 out of 80 thalassemia patients with multiple blood transfusions (18.8%) and three out of 31 prostitutes (9.7%) exceeded that among voluntary blood donors and pregnant women, which amounted to 14 out of 200 (7%) and seven out of 103 (6.8%), respectively. Additional molecular research should be performed in order to determine its short-, as well as long-term clinical significance.

AB  - A polymerase chain reaction assay with nested primers (nested PCR) deduced from the well conserved sequences of TTV ORF1 region was established to detect TTV DNA. PCR products from the 2 patients with non A-G hepatitis were cloned and sequenced to confirm its specificity. By using this assay, we tested the serum samples of 90 normal individuals, 88 paid blood donors, 79 intravenous drug users and 29 patients with non A-G hepatitis in Shenzhen, China. The positive rates of TTV DNA were 7.8%, 9.0%, 41.7% and 44.8%, respectively. TTV DNA was detected in 14 of the 90 normal individuals and 88 paid blood donors without any symptoms of liver disease. The results of this study suggest that TTV infection is common in normal population and the paid blood donors. The intravenous drug users are at high risk for TTV infection. TTV would be responsible for a part of non A-G hepatitis.

AB  - 104 serum samples from patients with liver diseases were detected for TTV DNA by nested-PCR method. The results showed that 25 of 104(24%) were positive for TTV DNA. Among 104 samples, 48%(12/42) were positive for nonA-E and G 19% (4/12) were positive for hepatitis A 25% (8/32) were positive hepatitis B 11.1% (1/9) was positive hepatitis C 4 of 6(66.7%) fulminant hepatitis cases were detected positive for TTV DNA. The partial gene of two TTV isolates from the patients were cloned and sequenced. The sequence analysis shows that there is 98.4% nucleotide identity between AB008394(from Japan) and one isolate from the patient (TTVEC023). The results suggest that TTV is associated with acute, chronic and fulminant hepatitis. TTV infection would be the important cause of non A-E and G hepatitis.

AB  - In order to investigate TTV infection in blood donors, 262 sera samples from blood donors were detected by nested--PCR method using primers from ORF1 of TTV genome DNA. The results showed that 18 of 58(31.0%) serum samples from blood donors with elevated transaminase level were positive for TTV DNA. 30 of 204 (14.7%) sera samples from blood donors with normal transaminase levels were positive for TTV DNA. There were significant difference between them (chi 2 = 38.1, P < 0.05). Five products of PCR for TTV DNA were purified and cloned to T Vector. The sequence analysis showed that there were above 97% nucleotide identity among AB008394 (from Japan), TTVCHNI (from China) and our 5 isolates from blood donors. The results suggest that there exists TTV infection among blood donors in China. TTV may be transmitted by blood transfusion. Our isolates, AB008394 and TTVCHN1 share a same genotype.
