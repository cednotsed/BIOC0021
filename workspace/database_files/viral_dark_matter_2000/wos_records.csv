Though phages are abundant in the gut, very few phages have been isolated from this ecosystem. Here, we report the genomes of 27 phages from the United States and Bangladesh that infect the prevalent human gut bacterium Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. These phages are mostly distinct from previously sequenced phages with the exception of two, which are crAss-like phages. We compare these isolates to existing human gut metagenomes, revealing similarities to previously inferred phages and additional unexplored phage diversity. Finally, we use host tropisms of these phages to identify alleles of phage structural genes associated with infectivity. This work provides a detailed view of the gut's "viral dark matter" and a framework for future efforts to further integrate isolation- and sequencing-focused efforts to understand gut-resident phages.

Polar environments differ to all other cold environments by experiencing 24-h sunlight in summer and no sunlight in winter. The Vestfold Hills in East Antarctica contains hundreds of lakes that have evolved from a marine origin only 3000-7000 years ago. Ace Lake is a meromictic (stratified) lake from this region that has been intensively studied since the 1970s. Here, a total of 120 metagenomes representing a seasonal cycle and four summers spanning a 10-year period were analyzed to determine the effects of the polar light cycle on microbial-driven nutrient cycles.Results: The lake system is characterized by complex sulfur and hydrogen cycling, especially in the anoxic layers, with multiple mechanisms for the breakdown of biopolymers present throughout the water column. The two most abundant taxa are phototrophs (green sulfur bacteria and cyanobacteria) that are highly influenced by the seasonal availability of sunlight. The extent of the Chlorobium biomass thriving at the interface in summer was captured in underwater video footage. The Chlorobium abundance dropped from up to 83% in summer to 6% in winter and 1% in spring, before rebounding to high levels. PredictedChlorobiumviruses and cyanophage were also abundant, but their levels did not negatively correlate with their hosts.Conclusion: Over-wintering expeditions in Antarctica are logistically challenging, meaning insight into winter processes has been inferred from limited data. Here, we found that in contrast to chemolithoautotrophic carbon fixation potential of Southern Ocean Thaumarchaeota, this marine-derived lake evolved a reliance on photosynthesis. While viruses associated with phototrophs also have high seasonal abundance, the negative impact of viral infection on host growth appeared to be limited. The microbial community as a whole appears to have developed a capacity to generate biomass and remineralize nutrients, sufficient to sustain itself between two rounds of sunlight-driven summer-activity. In addition, this unique metagenome dataset provides considerable opportunity for future interrogation of eukaryotes and their viruses, abundant uncharacterized taxa (i.e. dark matter), and for testing hypotheses about endemic species in polar aquatic ecosystems.

Laboratory experiments show that some cyanophages can only replicate in the light and thus exhibit diurnal infection rhythms under light-dark cycles. Field evidence also suggests synchronized infection of Prochlorococcus by cyanophages in the oceans, which should result in progressive expression of cyanophage early, middle, and late genes. However, distinct temporal expression patterns have not been observed in cyanophage field populations. Results In this study, we reanalyzed a previous metatranscriptomic dataset collected in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. In this dataset, it was previously shown that aggregate transcripts from cyanophage scaffolds display diurnal transcriptional rhythms with transcript abundances decreasing at night. By mapping metatranscriptomic reads to individual viral genes, we identified periodically expressed genes from putative viruses infecting the cyanobacteria Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, heterotrophic bacteria, and algae. Of the 41 cyanophage genes, 35 were from cyanomyoviruses. We grouped the periodically expressed cyanomyovirus genes into early, middle, and late genes based on the conserved temporal expression patterns of their orthologs in cyanomyovirus laboratory cultures. We found that the peak expression times of late genes in cyanophage field populations were significantly later than those of early and middle genes, which were similar to the temporal expression patterns of synchronized cyanophage laboratory cultures. Conclusions The significantly later peak expression times of late genes in cyanomyovirus field populations suggest that cyanophage infection of Prochlorococcus is synchronized in the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre. The night-time peak expression of late genes also suggests synchronized lysis of Prochlorococcus at night, which might result in synchronized release of dissolved organic matter to the marine food web.

Co-transcriptional RNA:DNA hybrids, organized in R-loop structures together with the displaced non-transcribed strand, assist gene expression, DNA repair and other physiological cellular functions. A dark side of the matter is that RNA:DNA hybrids are also a cause of DNA damage and human diseases.In this review, we summarize recent advances in the understanding of the mechanisms by which the impairment of hybrid turnover promotes DNA damage and genome instability via the interference with DNA replication and DNA double-strand break repair. We also discuss how hybrids could contribute to cancer, neurodegeneration and susceptibility to viral infections, focusing on dysfunctions associated with the anti-R-loop helicase Senataxin.

We selectively enriched for the genomes of circular DNA viruses in over 70 animal samples, ranging from nematodes to human tissue specimens. A bioinformatics pipeline, Cenote-Taker, was developed to automatically annotate eLife digest When scientists hunt for new DNA sequences, sometimes they get a lot more than they bargained for. Such is the case in metagenomic surveys, which analyze not just DNA of a particular organism, but all the DNA in an environment at large. A vexing problem with these surveys is the overwhelming number of DNA sequences detected that are so different from any known microbe that they cannot be classified using traditional approaches. However, some of these "known unknowns" are undoubtedly viral sequences, because only a fraction of the enormous diversity of viruses has been characterized.This "viral dark matter" is a major obstacle for those studying viruses. This led Tisza et al. to attempt to classify some of the unknown viral sequences in their metagenomic surveys. The search, which specifically focused on viruses with circular DNA genomes, detected over 2,500 circular viral genomes. Intensive analysis revealed that many of these genomes had similar makeup to previously discovered viruses, but hundreds of them were totally different from any known virus, based on typical methods of comparison.Computational analysis of genes that were conserved among some of these brand-new circular sequences often revealed virus-like features. Experiments on a few of these genes showed that they encoded proteins capable of forming particles reminiscent of characteristic viral shells, implying that these new sequences are indeed viruses.Tisza et al. have added the 2,500 newly characterized viral sequences to the publicly accessible GenBank database, and the sequences are being considered for the more authoritative RefSeq database, which currently contains around 9,000 complete viral genomes. The expanded databases will hopefully now better equip scientists to explore the enormous diversity of viruses and help medics and veterinarians to detect disease-causing viruses in humans and other animals.

However, most virome analyses have been performed on a limited fraction of known viruses. Using whole-virome analysis on a published keystone inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) cohort and an in-house ulcerative colitis dataset, we shed light on the composition of the human gut virome in IBD beyond this identifiable minority. We observe IBD-specific changes to the virome and increased numbers of temperate phage sequences in individuals with Crohn's disease. Unlike prior database-dependent methods, no changes in viral richness were observed. Among IBD subjects, the changes in virome composition reflected alterations in bacterial composition. Furthermore, incorporating both bacteriome and virome composition offered greater classification power between health and disease. This approach to analyzing whole virome across cohorts highlights significant IBD signals, which may be crucial for developing future biomarkers and therapeutics.

The taxonomic diversity of bacteriophages, as a natural parasite of bacteria, still remains obscure in human body biomes, representing a so-called "viral dark matter." Here, we isolated and characterized coliphages from blood, urine and tracheal aspirates samples collected at a tertiary care hospital in Austria. Phages were more often isolated from blood, followed by urine and tracheal aspirates. Phylogenetic analysis and genome comparisons allowed the identification of phages belonging to the Tunavirinae subfamily, and to the Peduovirus and Tequintavirus genera. Tunavirinae phages cluster together and are found in samples from 14 patients, suggesting their prevalence across a variety of human samples. When compared with other phage genomes, the highest similarity level was at 87.69% average nucleotide identity (ANI), which suggests that these are in fact a newly isolated phage species. Tequintavirus phages share a 95.90% with phage 3_29, challenging the ANI threshold currently accepted to differentiate phage species. The isolated phages appear to be virulent, with the exception of the Peduovirus members, which are integrative and seem to reside as prophages in bacterial genomes.

Few longitudinal studies in healthy adults showed a stable temporal gut virome, with high inter-individual diversity. In contrast, the infant virome shows a high temporal intra-individual diversity. Unfortunately, these virome studies ignore an enormous amount of unknown 'dark matter' sequences, leading to incomplete analyses and possibly incorrect conclusions. Also, the interactions between prokaryotes and bacteriophages in the gut seem to be too complex for currently available models. Therefore, there is a huge need of larger longitudinal cohort studies focusing on both the bacterial and viral component of the microbiome to be able to describe and understand this complex ecosystem.

(shandley@wustl.edu)									Viruses-Basel		2019	JUL 2019	11	7	Article No.: 587	587		English						Bacteriophages, or phages, are viruses that infect bacteria and archaea. Phages have diverse morphologies and can be coded in DNA or RNA and as single or double strands with a large range of genome sizes. With the increasing use of metagenomic sequencing approaches to analyze complex samples, many studies generate massive amounts of "viral dark matter", or sequences of viral origin unable to be classified either functionally or taxonomically. Metagenomic analysis of phages is still in its infancy, and uncovering novel phages continues to be a challenge. Work over the past two decades has begun to uncover key roles for phages in different environments, including the human gut. Recent studies in humans have identified expanded phage populations in both healthy infants and in inflammatory bowel disease patients, suggesting distinct phage activity during development and in specific disease states.

T-UCRs are highly conserved between mouse, rat, and human genomes, which might indicate a definitive role for these elements in health and disease. The growing body of evidence suggests that T-UCRs contribute to oncogenic pathways. Neuroblastoma is a type of childhood cancer that is challenging to treat. The role of non-coding RNAs in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma, in particular for cancer development, progression, and therapy resistance, has been documented. Exosmic non-coding RNAs are also involved in shaping the biology of the tumor microenvironment in neuroblastoma. In recent years, the involvement of T-UCRs in a wide variety of pathways in neuroblastoma has been discovered. Here, we present an overview of the involvement of T-UCRs in various cellular pathways, such as DNA damage response, proliferation, chemotherapy response, MYCN (v-myc myelocytomatosis viral related oncogene, neuroblastoma derived (avian)) amplification, gene copy number, and immune response, as well as correlate it to patient survival in neuroblastoma.

The general accessibility of skin also enables longitudinal clinical studies throughout the course of disease manifestations. Metagenomic analysis of diverse body sites in healthy humans defined the skin microbiome as shaped by local biogeography yet marked by strong individuality. We identified strain-level variation of dominant species as heterogeneous and multiphyletic. Re-sampling months and years later revealed that despite the skin's exposure to the external environment, its bacterial, fungal, and viral communities were largely stable over time. Strain and single nucleotide variant level analysis showed that individuals maintain, rather than reacquire prevalent microbes from the environment.Longitudinal stability of skin microbial communities generates hypotheses about colonization resistance and empowers clinical studies exploring alterations observed in disease states, such as the inflammatory skin disorder atopic dermatitis (AD; commonly known as eczema). Integrating shotgun metagenomic sequencing, culturing, and animal models, we explored a model whereby staphylococcal strains contribute to AD disease exacerbation. This delineation of highly individualized skin microbiomes with patient-specific strains underscores the individuality of the disease course and therapeutic response in AD patients and may represent an opportunity for precision medicine.Although landmark studies have shown that microbiota activate and educate host immunity, how the immune system shapes microbial communities and contributes to disease is less-well characterized. We explore the skin microbiome of patients with primary immune deficiencies to address this question and to expand our understanding of microbes that colonize human skin. Dedicator of cytokinesis 8 (DOCK8) deficiency is a rare primary human immunodeficiency characterized by recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, as well as atopy and cancer susceptibility(5). DOCK8, encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor highly expressed in lymphocytes, regulates actin cytoskeleton, which is critical for migration through collagen-dense tissues, such as skin(6). Analyzing deep metagenomic sequencing data from DOCK8-deficient skin samples demonstrated a notable increase in eukaryotic viral representation and diversity as compared to healthy volunteers. De novo assembly approaches identified hundreds of novel human papillomavirus genomes, illuminating microbial dark matter. Expansion of the skin virome in DOCK8-deficient patients underscores the importance of immune surveillance in controlling eukaryotic viral colonization and infection.					0	0		0	0	0			Biochemistry & Molecular Biology; Infectious Diseases; Dermatology	0892-6638	1530-6860			Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics; Infection; Dermatology (Human Medicine, Medical Sciences)	00520, General biology - Symposia, transactions and proceedings; 02506, Cytology - Animal; 02508, Cytology - Human; 10060, Biochemistry studies - General; 10064, Biochemistry studies - Proteins, peptides and amino acids; 15002, Blood - Blood and lymph studies; 15004, Blood - Blood cell studies; 18504, Integumentary system - Physiology and biochemistry; 18506, Integumentary system - Pathology; 24004, Neoplasms - Pathology, clinical aspects and systemic effects; 31000, Physiology and biochemistry of bacteria; 33502, Virology - General and methods; 34502, Immunology - General and methods; 34508, Immunology - Immunopathology, tissue immunology; 35500, Allergy; 36001, Medical and clinical microbiology - General and methods; 36002, Medical and clinical microbiology - Bacteriology; 36006, Medical and clinical microbiology - Virology; 36008, Medical and clinical microbiology - Mycology; 51522, Plant physiology - Chemical constituents	Microorganisms; Bacteria, Eubacteria, Microorganisms; Bacteria [05000]; [bacteria; (pathogen)]/Plantae; Fungi, Microorganisms, Nonvascular Plants, Plants; Fungi [15000]; [fungi; (pathogen)]/Primates, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Humans, Mammals, Primates, Vertebrates; Hominidae [86215]; [human; (host)]/Microorganisms; Microorganisms, Viruses; Viruses [03000]; [Virus; (pathogen)]	cancer; Neoplasms (MeSH); neoplastic disease/atopy; Hypersensitivity (MeSH); immune system disease/immune deficiency; immune system disease/cutaneous infection; integumentary system disease, infectious disease/Human papillomavirus infection; HPV infection; viral disease	collagen/actin cytoskeleton/guanine nucleotides/dedicator of cytokinesis 8						skin; integumentary system/lymphocyte; immune system, blood and lymphatics					2020-10-14	J	BCI:BCI202000180413	32655289	Article		Computational Identification of piRNAs Using Features Based on RNA Sequence, Structure, Thermodynamic and Physicochemical Properties		Monga, Isha (mongaisha4@gmail.com) ; Banerjee, Indranil (indranil@iisermohali.ac.in)									Current Genomics		2019		20	7	508-518	508	518	English						Rationale: PIWI-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) are a recently-discovered class of small noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) with a length of 21-35 nucleotides. They play a role in gene expression regulation, transposon silencing, and viral infection inhibition. Once considered as "dark matter" of ncRNAs, piRNAs emerged as important players in multiple cellular functions in different organisms. However, our knowledge of pi RNAs is still very limited as many pi RNAs have not been yet identified due to lack of robust computational predictive tools.Methods: To identify novel piRNAs, we developed piRNAPred, an integrated framework for piRNA prediction employing hybrid features like k-mer nucleotide composition, secondary structure, thermodynamic and physicochemical properties. A non-redundant dataset (D-3349 or D1684p+1665n ) comprising 1684 experimentally verified piRNAs and 1665 non-piRNA sequences was obtained from piRBase and NONCODE, respectively. These sequences were subjected to the computation of various sequence-structure based features in binary format and trained using different machine learning techniques, of which support vector machine (SVM) performed the best.Results: During the ten-fold cross-validation approach (10-CV), piRNAPred achieved an overall accuracy of 98.60% with Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.97 and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of 0.99. Furthermore, we achieved a dimensionality reduction of feature space using an attribute selected classifier.Conclusion: We obtained the highest performance in accurately predicting piRNAs as compared to the current state-of-the-art piRNA predictors. In conclusion, piRNAPred would be helpful to expand the piRNA repertoire, and provide new insights on piRNA functions.

An emerging research field focuses on how bacterial viruses hijack all aspects of the bacterial metabolism, including the host machinery of RNA metabolism. This review addresses research on phage-based influence on RNA turnover, which can act either indirectly or via dedicated effector molecules that target degradosome assemblies. The structural divergence of host RNA turnover mechanisms likely explains the limited number of phage proteins directly targeting these specialized, host-specific complexes. The unique and nonconserved structure of DIP, a phage-encoded inhibitor of the Pseudomonas degradosome, illustrates this hypothesis. However, the natural occurrence of phage-encoded mechanisms regulating RNA turnover indicates a clear evolutionary benefit for this mode of host manipulation. Further exploration of the viral dark matter of unknown phage proteins may reveal more structurally novel interference strategies that, in turn, could be exploited for biotechnological applications.

However, even more numerous than bacteria are the bacteriophages of the viral portion of the microbiome, which have emerged with identifiable disease signatures in other diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases.

Healthy skin microbial communities are dominated by bacteria with low viral representation(1-3), mainly bacteriophage. Specific eukaryotic viruses have been implicated in both common and rare skin diseases, but cataloging skin viral communities has been limited. Alterations in host immunity provide an opportunity to expand our understanding of microbial-host interactions. Primary immunodeficient patients manifest with various viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic infections, including skin infections(4).

(shighlander@tgen.org)									Microbiome		2018	NOV 8 2018	6		Article No.: 201	201		English						BackgroundTravelers' diarrhea (TD) is often caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, enteroaggregative E. coli, other bacterial pathogens, Norovirus, and occasionally parasites. Nevertheless, standard diagnostic methods fail to identify pathogens in more than 40% of TD patients. It is predicted that new pathogens may be causative agents of the disease.ResultsWe performed a comprehensive amplicon and whole genome shotgun (WGS) metagenomic study of the fecal microbiomes from 23 TD patients and sevenhealthy travelers, all of which were negative for the known etiologic agents of TD based on standard microbiological and immunological assays. Abnormal and diverse taxonomic profiles in TD samples were revealed. WGS reads were assembled and the resulting contigs were visualized using multiple query types. A semi-manual workflow was applied to isolate independent genomes from metagenomic pools. A total of 565 genome bins were extracted, 320 of which were complete enough to be characterized as cellular genomes; 160 were viral genomes. We made predictions of the etiology of disease for many of the individual subjects based on the properties and features of the recovered genomes. Multiple patients with low-diversity metagenomes were predominated by one to several E. coli strains. Functional annotation allowed prediction of pathogenic type in many cases. Five patients were co-infected with E. coli and other members of Enterobacteriaceae, including Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Citrobacter; these may represent blooms of organisms that appear following secretory diarrhea. New dark matter microbes were observed in multiple samples. In one, we identified a novel TM7 genome that phylogenetically clustered with a sludge isolate; it carries genes encoding potential virulence factors. In multiple samples, we observed high proportions of putative novel viral genomes, some of which form clusters with the ubiquitous gut virus, crAssphage. The total relative abundance of viruses was significantly higher in healthy travelers versus TD patients.ConclusionOur study highlights the strength of assembly-based metagenomics, especially the manually curated, visualization-assisted binning of contigs, in resolving unusual and under-characterized pathogenic profiles of human-associated microbiomes. Results show that TD may be polymicrobial, with multiple novel cellular and viral strains as potential players in the diarrheal disease.

The majority of them are very small (falling under the limit of 0.5 mu m), and collectively, they are extraordinarily diverse. In fact, the majority of the genetic diversity on the planet is found in the so-called virosphere, or the world of viruses. Furthermore, the most frequent viral agents of disease in humans display an RNA genome, and frequently evolve very fast, due to the fact that most of their polymerases are devoid of proofreading activity. Therefore, their detection, genetic characterization, and epidemiological surveillance are rather challenging. This review (part of the Curated Collection on Advances in Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases) describes many of the methods that, throughout the last few decades, have been used for viral detection and analysis. Despite the challenge of having to deal with high genetic diversity, the majority of these methods still depend on the amplification of viral genomic sequences, using sequence-specific or sequence-independent approaches, exploring thermal profiles or a single nucleic acid amplification temperature. Furthermore, viral populations, and especially those with RNA genomes, are not usually genetically uniform but encompass swarms of genetically related, though distinct, viral genomes known as viral quasispecies. Therefore, sequence analysis of viral amplicons needs to take this fact into consideration, as it constitutes a potential analytic problem. Possible technical approaches to deal with it are also described here. *This article is part of a curated collection.

Most of these novel sequences bear little or no homology to existing databases (referred to as the "viral dark matter"). Also, these sequences are primarily derived from DNA-encoded bacteriophages (phages) with few RNA phages included. Despite the rapid advancements in high-throughput sequencing, few studies enrich for RNA viruses, i.e., target viral rather than cellular fraction and/or RNA rather than DNA via a reverse transcriptase step, in an attempt to capture the RNA viruses present in a microbial communities. It is timely to compile existing and relevant information about RNA phages to provide an insight into many of their important biological features, which should aid in sequence-based discovery and in their subsequent annotation. Without comprehensive studies, the biological significance of RNA phages has been largely ignored. Future bacteriophage studies should be adapted to ensure they are properly represented in phageomic studies.

During an investigation of papillomatous skin disease in an elasmobranch species, the giant guitarfish (Rhynchobatus djiddensis), a novel virus, distinct from all known viral families in regard to particle size, morphology, genome organization, and helicase phylogeny was discovered. Large inclusion bodies containing 75-nm icosahedral viral particles were present within epithelial cell nuclei in the proliferative skin lesions. Deep metagenomic sequencing revealed a 22-kb circular dsDNA viral genome, tentatively named guitarfish "adomavirus" (GAdoV), with only distant homology to two other fish viruses, Japanese eel endothelial cellinfecting virus (JEECV) and a recently reported marbled eel virus. Phylogenetic analysis of the helicase domain places the guitarfish virus in a novel clade that is equidistant between members of the Papillomaviridae and Polyomaviridae families. Specific PCR, quantitative PCR, and in situ hybridization were used to detect, quantify, and confirm that GAdoV DNA was localized to affected epithelial cell nuclei. Changes in the viral titer, as well as the presence of a hybridization signal, coincided with the progression and then final resolution of gross and microscopic lesions. The results indicate that GAdoV is the causative agent of the proliferative skin lesions.IMPORTANCE Cartilaginous fish, including the sharks and rays, evolved from ancestral fish species at least 400 million years ago. Even though they are the descendants of one of the most ancient vertebrate lineages, reports of viral diseases in these species are rare and poorly documented. Deep sequencing revealed a highly divergent virus, tentatively named guitarfish adomavirus, that is distantly related to known papillomaviruses and polyomaviruses. Out of the eight predicted viral genes, only the helicase could be identified as viral by sequence homology searches (BLAST), exemplifying the difficulties of discovering novel viruses within seas of unidentifiable "dark matter" associated with deep sequencing data. The novel adomavirus represents the first viral genome shown to cause clinical disease in a cartilaginous fish species, the giant guitarfish. Our findings demonstrate that emerging fish viruses are fertile ground to expand our understanding of viral evolution in vertebrates.

However, one of the main problems encountered in metagenomic studies is the high percentage of sequences that cannot be assigned taxonomically using commonly used similarity-based approaches (e.g. BLAST or HMM). These unassigned sequences are allegorically called "dark matter" in the metagenomic literature and are often referred to as being derived from new or unknown organisms. Here, based on published and original metagenomic datasets coming from virus-like particle enriched samples, we present and quantify the improvement of viral taxonomic assignment that is achievable with a new similarity-based approach. Indeed, prior to any use of similarity based taxonomic assignment methods, we propose assembling contigs from short reads as is currently routinely done in metagenomic studies, but then to further map unassembled reads to the assembled contigs. This additional mapping step increases significantly the proportions of taxonomically assignable sequence reads from a variety plant, insect and environmental (estuary, lakes, soil, feces) - of virome studies.

One common route through which a developing fetus is exposed to inflammation is with intrauterine inflammation. To that end, we utilized an animal model of intrauterine inflammation (IUI; intrauterine lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration, 50 mu g, E15) to assess placental and fetal brain inflammatory responses, white matter integrity, anxiety-related behaviors (elevated zero maze, light dark box, open field), microglial counts, and the CNS cytokine response to an acute injection of LPS in both males and females. These studies revealed that for multiple endpoints (fetal brain cytokine levels, cytokine response to adult LPS challenge) male IUI offspring were uniquely affected by intrauterine inflammation, while for other endpoints (behavior, microglial number) both sexes were similarly affected. These data advance our understanding of sex-specific effects of early life exposure to inflammation in a translationally-relevant model. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Vast populations prey on the cellular microbiota in all habitats, including the human gut.Main body: Here we review approaches for studying the human virome, and some recent results on movement of viral sequences between bacterial cells and eukaryotic hosts. We first overview biochemical and bioinformatic methods, emphasizing that specific choices in the methods used can have strong effects on the results obtained. We then review studies characterizing the virome of the healthy human gut, which reveal that most of the viruses detected are typically uncharacterized phage - the viral dark matter - and that viruses that infect human cells are encountered only rarely. We then review movement of phage between bacterial cells during antibiotic treatment. Here a radical proposal for extensive movement of antibiotic genes on phage has been challenged by a careful reanalysis of the metagenomic annotation methods used. We then review two recent studies of movement of whole phage communities between human individuals during fecal microbial transplantation, which emphasize the possible role of lysogeny in dispersal.Short conclusion: Methods for studying the human gut virome are improving, yielding interesting data on movement of phage genes between cells and mammalian host organisms. However, viral populations are vast, and studies of their composition and function are just beginning.

(koonin@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)									mBio		2017	SEP-OCT 2017	8	5	Article No.: e01397-17	e01397	17	English						Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and CRISPR-associated protein (CRISPR-Cas) systems store the memory of past encounters with foreign DNA in unique spacers that are inserted between direct repeats in CRISPR arrays. For only a small fraction of the spacers, homologous sequences, called proto-spacers, are detectable in viral, plasmid, and microbial genomes. The rest of the spacers remain the CRISPR "dark matter." We performed a comprehensive analysis of the spacers from all CRISPR-cas loci identified in bacterial and archaeal genomes, and we found that, depending on the CRISPR-Cas subtype and the prokaryotic phylum, protospacers were detectable for 1% to about 19% of the spacers (similar to 7% global average). Among the detected protospacers, the majority, typically 80 to 90%, originated from viral genomes, including proviruses, and among the rest, the most common source was genes that are integrated into microbial chromosomes but are involved in plasmid conjugation or replication. Thus, almost all spacers with identifiable protospacers target mobile genetic elements (MGE). The GC content, as well as dinucleotide and tetranucleotide compositions, of microbial genomes, their spacer complements, and the cognate viral genomes showed a nearly perfect correlation and were almost identical. Given the near absence of self-targeting spacers, these findings are most compatible with the possibility that the spacers, including the dark matter, are derived almost completely from the species-specific microbial mobilomes.IMPORTANCE The principal function of CRISPR-Cas systems is thought to be protection of bacteria and archaea against viruses and other parasitic genetic elements. The CRISPR defense function is mediated by sequences from parasitic elements, known as spacers, that are inserted into CRISPR arrays and then transcribed and employed as guides to identify and inactivate the cognate parasitic genomes. However, only a small fraction of the CRISPR spacers match any sequences in the current databases, and of these, only a minority correspond to known parasitic elements. We show that nearly all spacers with matches originate from viral or plasmid genomes that are either free or have been integrated into the host genome. We further demonstrate that spacers with no matches have the same properties as those of identifiable origins, strongly suggesting that all spacers originate from mobile elements.

Depending on the sample, viral dark matter can make up from anywhere between 40 and 90% of sequences. This review focuses on the specific nature of dark matter as it relates to viral sequences. We identify three factors that contribute to the existence of viral dark matter: the divergence and length of virus sequences, the limitations of alignment based classification, and limited representation of viruses in reference sequence databases. We then discuss current methods that have been developed to at least partially circumvent these limitations and thereby reduce the extent of viral dark matter. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

There is a need for bioinformatic tools capable of parallel processing of virome sequencing data by exactly identical methods: this is especially important in studies of multifactorial diseases, or in parallel comparison of laboratory protocols.Results: We have developed a web-based application allowing direct upload of sequences from multiple virome samples using custom parameters. The samples are then processed in parallel using an identical protocol, and can be easily reanalyzed. The pipeline performs de-novo assembly, taxonomic classification of viruses as well as sample analyses based on user-defined grouping categories. Tables of virus abundance are produced from cross-validation by remapping the sequencing reads to a union of all observed reference viruses. In addition, read sets and reports are created after processing unmapped reads against known human and bacterial ribosome references. Secured interactive results are dynamically plotted with population and diversity charts, clustered heatmaps and a sortable and searchable abundance table.Conclusions: The Vipie web application is a unique tool for multi-sample metagenomic analysis of viral data, producing searchable hits tables, interactive population maps, alpha diversity measures and clustered heatmaps that are grouped in applicable custom sample categories. Known references such as human genome and bacterial ribosomal genes are optionally removed from unmapped ('dark matter') reads. Secured results are accessible and shareable on modern browsers. Vipie is a freely available web-based tool whose code is open source.

The first classification of living organisms proposed by Ehrenberg in 1833 was based on what we could visualize. The failure of this kind of classification arises from viral culture, which preceded direct observations that were finally achieved during the 20th century by electron microscopy.The number of prokaryotic species is estimated at approximately 10 million, although only 1800 were known in 1980, and 14,000 to date, thanks to the advent of 16S rRNA amplification and sequencing. This highlights our inability to access the entire diversity. Indeed, a large number of bacteria are only, known as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) and detected as a result of metagenomics studies, revealing an unexplored world known as the "dark matter". Recently, the rebirth of bacterial culture through the example of culturomics has dramatically increased the human gut repertoire as well as the 18SrRNA sequencing allowed to largely extend the repertoire of Eukaryotes. Finally, filtration and co-culture on free-living protists associated with high-throughput culture elucidated a part of the megavirome.While the majority of studies currently performed on the human gut microbiota focus on bacterial diversity, it appears that several other prokaryotes (including archaea) and eukaryotic populations also inhabit this ecosystem; their detection depending exclusively on the tools used. Rational and comprehensive establishment of this ecosystem will allow the understanding of human health associated with gut microbiota and the potential to change this. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The complexity of virus-host interaction networks is progressively fathomed by novel metagenomic approaches. By using a novel metagenomic method, we explored the virome in mammalian cell cultures and clinical samples to identify an extensive pool of mobile genetic elements in all of these ecosystems. Despite aseptic treatment, cell cultures harbored extensive and diverse phage populations with a high abundance of as yet unknown and uncharacterized viruses (viral dark matter). Unknown phages also predominated in the oropharynx and urine of healthy individuals and patients infected with cytomegalovirus despite demonstration of active cytomegalovirus replication. The novelty of viral sequences correlated primarily with the individual evaluated, whereas relative abundance of encoded protein functions was associated with the ecologic niches probed. Together, these observations demonstrate the extensive presence of viral dark matter in human and artificial ecosystems.-Thannesberger, J., Hellinger, H.-J., Klymiuk, I., Kastner, M.-T., Rieder, F.

However, our knowledge regarding viral genomes is biased toward culturable viruses. In this study, we analyzed 1,600 (1,352 nonredundant) complete double-stranded DNA viral genomes (10 to 211 kb) assembled from 52 marine viromes. Together with 244 previously reported uncultured viral genomes, a genome-wide comparison delineated 617 genus-level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) for these environmental viral genomes (EVGs). Of these, 600 OTUs contained no representatives from known viruses, thus putatively corresponding to novel viral genera. Predicted hosts of the EVGs included major groups of marine prokaryotes, such as marine group II Euryarchaeota and SAR86, from which no viruses have been isolated to date, as well as Flavobacteri-aceae and SAR116. Our analysis indicates that marine cyanophages are already well represented in genome databases and that one of the EVGs likely represents a new cyanophage lineage. Several EVGs encode many enzymes that appear to function for an efficient utilization of iron-sulfur clusters or to enhance host survival. This suggests that there is a selection pressure on these marine viruses to accumulate genes for specific viral propagation strategies. Finally, we revealed that EVGs contribute to a 4-fold increase in the recruitment of photic-zone viromes compared with the use of current reference viral genomes.IMPORTANCE Viruses are diverse and play significant ecological roles in marine ecosystems. However, our knowledge of genome-level diversity in viruses is biased toward those isolated from few culturable hosts. Here, we determined 1,352 nonredundant complete viral genomes from marine environments. Lifting the uncertainty that clouds short incomplete sequences, whole-genome-wide analysis suggests that these environmental genomes represent hundreds of putative novel viral genera. Predicted hosts include dominant groups of marine bacteria and archaea with no isolated viruses to date. Some of the viral genomes encode many functionally related enzymes, suggesting a strong selection pressure on these marine viruses to control cellular metabolisms by accumulating genes.

Due to the large volume, the global deep Ocean plays a central role in the regulation of climate, possibly buffering the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide if processes of CO2 fixation compensate for respiration. We investigated the rates of several prokaryotic activities (dissolved and particulate primary production, heterotrophic carbon production and respiration) in meso- and bathypelagic waters of the Mediterranean Sea, covering all sub-basins. Chemosynthesis was the main process for C uptake. The rates of organic C (OC) excretion (or viral-induced cell lysis) inferred from the dissolved primary production measurements were noteworthy, being comparable to particulate primary production, and possibly contributing to the formation of non-sinking particulate organic matter. Inorganic C fixation rates were significantly higher than those reported for other deep-sea systems, probably as a consequence of the persistently higher temperature of dark Mediterranean waters or to phylogenetically diverse communities involved in the process. Primary production was negatively correlated with dissolved organic carbon concentration and showed an inverse pattern to heterotrophic carbon production, indicating a niche partitioning between heterotrophs and autotrophs. In sum, the deep Mediterranean Sea harbors active autotrophic communities able to fix inorganic carbon faster than the heterotrophic carbon production rates.

However, information on the functioning of the microbial assemblages and the role of viruses in such low-oxygen systems remains largely unknown. Here, we used the marine Rogoznica Lake as a natural model to investigate the possible consequences of oxygen depletion on virus-prokaryote interactions and prokaryotic metabolism in pelagic and benthic ecosystems. We found higher bacterial and archaeal abundances in oxygen-depleted than in oxic conditions, associated with higher heterotrophic carbon production, enzymatic activities and dark inorganic carbon fixation ( DCF) rates. The oxygen-depleted systems were also characterized by higher viral abundance, production and virus-induced prokaryotic mortality. The highest DCF relative contribution to the whole total C production (>30%) was found in oxygen-depleted systems, at the highest virus-induced prokaryotic mortality values (>90%). Our results suggest that the higher rates of viral lysis in oxygen-depleted conditions can significantly enhance DCF by accelerating heterotrophic processes, organic matter cycling, and hence the supply of inorganic reduced compounds fuelling chemosynthesis. These findings suggest that the expansion of low-oxygen zones can trigger higher viral impacts on prokaryotic heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic metabolism, with cascading effects, neglected so far, on biogeochemical processes.

The potential scope of this variation exceeds that of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. DGRs were known to exist only in viruses and bacteria until their recent discovery in archaea belonging to the 'microbial dark matter', specifically in organisms closely related to Nanoarchaeota. However, Nanoarchaeota DGR variable proteins were unassignable to known protein folds and apparently unrelated to characterized DGR variable proteins.Results: To address the issue of how Nanoarchaeota DGR variable proteins accommodate massive sequence variation, we determined the 2.52 resolution limit crystal structure of one such prein, AvpA, which revealed a C- type lectin (CLec)- fold that organizes a putative ligand-binding site that is capable of accommodating 1013 sequences. This fold is surprisingly reminiscent of the CLec- folds of viral and bacterial DGR variable protein, but differs sufficiently to define a new CLec- fold subclass, which is consistent with early divergence between bacterial and archaeal DGRs.The structure also enabled identification of a group of AvpA- like proteins in multiple putative DGRs from uncultivated archaea. These variable proteins may aid Nanoarchaeota and these uncultivated archaea in symbiotic relationships.Conclusions: Our results have uncovered the widespread conservation of the CLec-fold in viruses, bacteria, and archaea for accommodating massive sequence variation. In addition, to our knowledge, this is the first report of an archaeal CLec- fold protein.

Yet, the bulk of bacteriophages form part of the vast uncultured dark matter of the microbial biosphere. In spite of the paucity of cultured marine bacteriophages, it is known that marine bacteriophages have major impacts on microbial population structure and the biogeochemical cycling of key elements. Despite the ecological relevance of marine bacteriophages, there are relatively few isolates with complete genome sequences. This minireview focuses on knowledge gathered from these genomes put in the context of viral metagenomic data and highlights key advances in the field, particularly focusing on genome structure and auxiliary metabolic genes.

Storage and analysis of such big data is difficult and time-consuming. Interestingly, analysis shows that environmental and human metagenomes include a significant amount of non-annotated sequences, representing a 'dark matter.' We established a bioinformatics pipeline that automatically detects metagenome reads matching query sequences from a given set and applied this tool to the detection of sequences matching large and giant DNA viral members of the proposed order Megavirales or virophages. A total of 1,045 environmental and human metagenomes (approximate to Terabase) were collected, processed, and stored on our bioinformatics server. In addition, nucleotide and protein sequences from 93 Megavirales representatives, including 19 giant viruses of amoeba, and 5 virophages, were collected. The pipeline was generated by scripts written in Python language and entitled MG-Digger. Metagenomes previously found to contain megavirus-like sequences were tested as controls. MG-Digger was able to annotate 100s of metagenome sequences as best matching those of giant viruses. These sequences were most often found to be similar to phycodnavirus or mimivirus sequences, but included reads related to recently available pandoraviruses, Pithovirus sibericum, and faustoviruses. Compared to other tools, MG-Digger combined stand-alone use on Linux or Windows operating systems through a user-friendly interface, implementation of ready-to-use customized metagenome databases and query sequence databases, adjustable parameters for BLAST searches, and creation of output files containing selected reads with best match identification. Compared to Metavir 2, a reference tool in viral metagenome analysis. MG-Digger detected 8% more true positive Megavirales-related reads in a control metagenome. The present work shows that massive, automated and recurrent analyses of metagenomes are effective in improving knowledge about the presence and prevalence of giant viruses in the environment and the human body.

Although recent analytical advances are rapidly improving taxonomic annotations, identifying functional darkmatter remains problematic. Here, we apply paired metaproteomics and dsDNA-targeted metagenomics to identify 1,875 virion-associated proteins from the ocean. Over one-half of these proteins were newly functionally annotated and represent abundant and widespread viral metagenome-derived protein clusters (PCs). One primarily unannotated PC dominated the dataset, but structural modeling and genomic context identified this PC as a previously unidentified capsid protein from multiple uncultivated tailed virus families. Furthermore, four of the five most abundant PCs in the metaproteome represent capsid proteins containing the HK97-like protein fold previously found in many viruses that infect all three domains of life. The dominance of these proteins within our dataset, as well as their global distribution throughout the world's oceans and seas, supports prior hypotheses that this HK97-like protein fold is the most abundant biological structure on Earth. Together, these culture-independent analyses improve virion-associated protein annotations, facilitate the investigation of proteins within natural viral communities, and offer a high-throughput means of illuminating functional viral dark matter.

The bulk of nuclear RNA however is non-coding ('dark matter RNA', as described in one publication [1]). This may just have been an interesting aspect of genetic regulation with little consequence for pharmaceutical research were it not for the fact that some non-coding RNAs are involved in disease pathogenesis and are potential drug targets (e.g. Refs [2-4]). This chapter lists annotated entries taken from the long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) and microRNAs (miRNAs). Both entries represent a small proportion of total lnc and miRNAs listed by the HGNC, 0.7 and 8%, respectively. MRX34 is a mimic of microRNA 34a undergoing phase I clinical trials at the time of writing [5]. It is the only drug candidate listed in this chapter as others at a more advanced stage of clinical development are directed against viral targets.

Light is also crucial for bacteriophages (cyanophages) that infect cyanobacteria. As the first step of infection, the adsorption of some cyanophages to their host cells is light-dependent. Moreover, cyanophage replication is affected by light intensity and possibly the host cell cycle. Photosynthesis and carbon metabolism genes have been found in cyanophage genomes. With these genes, cyanophages may affect the host metabolic rhythm. Field studies suggest that cyanophage infection of cyanobacteria in aquatic environments is synchronized directly or indirectly to the light-dark cycle. These discoveries are beginning to reveal how the daily light-dark cycle shapes the interaction of cyanophages and cyanobacteria, which eventually influences matter and energy transformation in aquatic environments.

We reveal how developments in high-throughput sequencing technologies and associated data analysis methodologies are helping to illuminate this abundant 'biological dark matter.' Current evidence suggests that the human gut virome is a highly individual but temporally stable collective, dominated by phages exhibiting a temperate lifestyle. This viral community also appears to encode a surprisingly rich functional repertoire that confers a range of attributes to their bacterial hosts, ranging from bacterial virulence and pathogenesis to maintaining host microbiome stability and community resilience. Despite the significant advances in our understanding of the gut virome in recent years, it is clear that we remain in a period of discovery and revelation, as new methods and technologies begin to provide deeper understanding of the inherent ecological characteristics of this viral ecosystem. As our understanding increases, the nature of the multi-partite interactions occurring between host and microbiome will become clearer, helping us to more rationally define the concepts and principles that will underpin approaches to using human gut virome components for medical or biotechnological applications.

Viral communities have the potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Bacteriophages are known to influence the structure and function of microbial communities through predation and genetic exchange. Human viruses are associated with skin cancers and a multitude of cutaneous manifestations. Despite these important roles, little is known regarding the human skin virome and its interactions with the host microbiome. Here we evaluated the human cutaneous double-stranded DNA virome by metagenomic sequencing of DNA from purified virus-like particles (VLPs). In parallel, we employed metagenomic sequencing of the total skin microbiome to assess covariation and infer interactions with the virome. Samples were collected from 16 subjects at eight body sites over 1 month. In addition to the microenviroment, which is known to partition the bacterial and fungal microbiota, natural skin occlusion was strongly associated with skin virome community composition. Viral contigs were enriched for genes indicative of a temperate phage replication style and also maintained genes encoding potential antibiotic resistance and virulence factors. CRISPR spacers identified in the bacterial DNA sequences provided a record of phage predation and suggest a mechanism to explain spatial partitioning of skin phage communities. Finally, we modeled the structure of bacterial and phage communities together to reveal a complex microbial environment with a Corynebacterium hub. These results reveal the previously underappreciated diversity, encoded functions, and viral-microbial dynamic unique to the human skin virome.IMPORTANCE To date, most cutaneous microbiome studies have focused on bacterial and fungal communities. Skin viral communities and their relationships with their hosts remain poorly understood despite their potential to modulate states of cutaneous health and disease. Previous studies employing whole-metagenome sequencing without purification for virus-like particles (VLPs) have provided some insight into the viral component of the skin microbiome but have not completely characterized these communities or analyzed interactions with the host microbiome. Here we present an optimized virus purification technique and corresponding analysis tools for gaining novel insights into the skin virome, including viral "dark matter," and its potential interactions with the host microbiome. The work presented here establishes a baseline of the healthy human skin virome and is a necessary foundation for future studies examining viral perturbations in skin health and disease.

In this study, we mined publicly available bacterial and archaeal genomic data sets to identify 12,498 high-confidence viral genomes linked to their microbial hosts. These data augment public data sets 10-fold, provide first viral sequences for 13 new bacterial phyla including ecologically abundant phyla, and help taxonomically identify 7-38% of 'unknown' sequence space in viromes. Genome-and network-based classification was largely consistent with accepted viral taxonomy and suggested that (i) 264 new viral genera were identified (doubling known genera) and (ii) cross-taxon genomic recombination is limited. Further analyses provided empirical data on extrachromosomal prophages and coinfection prevalences, as well as evaluation of in silico virus-host linkage predictions. Together these findings illustrate the value of mining viral signal from microbial genomes.

Churchill was pondering how and when to rebuild the British House of Commons, which had been destroyed by enemy bombs on May 10th 1941. The old House had been small and insufficient to hold all its members, but was restored to its original form in 1950 in order to recapture the "convenience and dignity" that the building had shaped into its parliamentary members. The circular loop whereby buildings or dwellings are shaped and go on to shape those that reside in them is also true of pathogens and their hosts. As obligate parasites, pathogens need to alter their cellular host environments to ensure survival. Typically pathogens modify cellular transcription profiles and in doing so, the pathogen in turn is affected, thereby closing the loop. As key orchestrators of gene expression, non-coding RNAs provide a vast and extremely precise set of tools for pathogens to target in order to shape the cellular environment. This review will focus on host non-coding RNAs that are manipulated by the infamous intracellular pathogen, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). We will briefly describe both short and long host non-coding RNAs and discuss how HIV gains control of these factors to ensure widespread dissemination throughout the host as well as the establishment of lifelong, chronic infection.

(mbsulli@email.arizona.edu)									Frontiers in Microbiology		2015	MAR 16 2015	6		Article No.: 199	199		English						Viral metagenomics (viromics) is a tremendous tool to reveal viral taxonomic and functional diversity across ecosystems ranging from the human gut to the world's oceans. As with microbes however, there appear vast swaths of "dark matter" yet to be documented for viruses, even among relatively well studied viral types. Here, we use viromics to explore the "Far-T4 phages" sequence space, a neighbor clade from the well-studied T4-like phages that was first detected through PCR study in seawater and subsequently identified in freshwater lakes through 454-sequenced viromes. To advance the description of these viruses beyond this single marker gene, we explore Far-T4 genome fragments assembled from two deeply-sequenced freshwater viromes. Single gene phylogenetic trees confirm that the Far-T4 phages are divergent from the T4-like phages, genome fragments reveal largely collinear genome organizations, and both data led to the delineation of five Far 14 clades. Three-dimensional models of major capsid proteins are consistent with a 14-like structure, and highlight a highly conserved core flanked by variable insertions. Finally, we contextualize these now better characterized Far-T4 phages by re-analyzing 196 previously published viromes. These suggest that Far-T4 are common in freshwater and seawater as only four of 82 aquatic viromes lacked Far-T4-like sequences. Variability in representation across the five newly identified clades suggests clade-specific niche differentiation may be occurring across the different biomes, though the underlying mechanism remains unidentified. While complete genome assembly from complex communities and the lack of host linkage information still bottleneck virus discovery through viromes, these findings exemplify the power of metagenomics approaches to assess the diversity, evolutionary history, and genomic characteristics of novel uncultivated phages.

Accordingly, a plethora of phage resistance systems has been identified in bacterial genomes (Labrie etal, ), including restriction-modification systems (R-M) (Tock & Dryden, ), abortive infection (Abi) (Chopin etal, ), Argonaute-based interference (Swarts etal, ), as well as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and associated protein (Cas) adaptive immune system (CRISPR-Cas) (Barrangou & Marraffini, ; Van der Oost etal, ). Predictably, the dark matter of bacterial genomes contains a wealth of genetic gold. A study published in this issue of The EMBO Journal by Goldfarb etal () unveils bacteriophage exclusion (BREX) as a novel, widespread bacteriophage resistance system that provides innate immunity against virulent and temperate phage in bacteria.

Using sensitive methods for sequences comparison and protein structure prediction, we performed a detailed comparative analysis of clusters of such genes, which we denote "dark matter islands", in archaeal genomes. The dark matter islands comprise up to 20 % of archaeal genomes and show remarkable heterogeneity and diversity. Nevertheless, three classes of entities are common in these genomic loci: (a) integrated viral genomes and other mobile elements; (b) defense systems, and (c) secretory and other membrane-associated systems. The dark matter islands in the genome of thermophiles and mesophiles show similar general trends of gene content, but thermophiles are substantially enriched in predicted membrane proteins whereas mesophiles have a greater proportion of recognizable mobile elements. Based on this analysis, we predict the existence of several novel groups of viruses and mobile elements, previously unnoticed variants of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, and new secretory systems that might be involved in stress response, intermicrobial conflicts and biogenesis of novel, uncharacterized membrane structures.

Identification of virus-host pairs relies either on their cultivation or on metagenomics and tentative assignment based on genomic signatures. Both approaches have severe drawbacks when aiming to target such pairs within the uncultured majority. Here we present an unambiguous way to assign viruses to hosts that does not rely on any previous information about either of them nor requires their cultivation. First, genomic contents of individual cells present in an environmental sample are retrieved by means of single-cell genomic technologies. Then, individual cell genomes are hybridized against a set of individual viral genomes from the same sample, previously immobilized on a microarray. Infected cells will yield positive hybridization as they carry viral genomes, which can be then sequenced and characterized. Using this method, we pinpoint viruses infecting the ubiquitous hyperhalophilic Nanohaloarchaeota, included in the so-called 'microbial dark matter' (the uncultured fraction of the microbial world).

DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RNAP) genes are universal in microbes and conserved in giant viruses and may replace rDNA for identifying microbes. We found while reconstructing RNAP subunit 2 (RNAP2) phylogeny that a giant virus sequenced together with the genome of a large eukaryote, Hydra magnipapillata, has been overlooked. To explore the dark matter, we used viral RNAP2 and reconstructed putative ancestral RNAP2, which were significantly superior in detecting distant clades than current sequences, and we revealed two additional unknown mimiviruses, misclassified as an euryarchaeote and an oomycete plant pathogen, and detected unknown putative viral clades. We suggest using RNAP systematically to decipher the black matter and identify giant viruses.

For human rotavirus, the exogenous effects were greater than the endogenous effects under irradiation with full spectrum and UVA and visible light at 25 degrees C. For porcine rotavirus, the exogenous effects with UVA and visible light irradiation were only observed at high temperatures, >40 degrees C. The results from dark experiments conducted at different temperatures suggest that porcine rotavirus has higher thermostability than human rotavirus. Concentrations of 3'-MAP excited triplet states of 1.8 fM and above resulted in significant human rotavirus inactivation. The measured excited triplet state concentrations of <= 0.45 fM produced by UVA and visible light irradiation of natural dissolved organic matter solutions were likely not directly responsible for rotavirus inactivation. Instead, the linear correlation for human rotavirus inactivation rate constant (k(obs)) with the phenol degradation rate constant (k(exp)) found in both 1 mM NaHCO3 and 1 mM phosphate-buffered solutions suggested that OH radical was a major reactive species for the exogenous inactivation of rotaviruses. Linear correlations between rotavirus kobs and specific UV254 nm absorbance of two river-dissolved organic matter and two effluent organic matter isolates indicated that organic matter aromaticity may help predict formation of radicals responsible for rotavirus inactivation. The results from this study also suggested that the differences in rotavirus strains should be considered when predicting solar inactivation of rotavirus in sunlit surface waters.

(B.V.Jones@Brighton.ac.uk)									Nature Communications		2013	SEP 2013	4		Article No.: 2420	2420		English						Bacterial viruses (bacteriophages) have a key role in shaping the development and functional outputs of host microbiomes. Although metagenomic approaches have greatly expanded our understanding of the prokaryotic virosphere, additional tools are required for the phage-oriented dissection of metagenomic data sets, and host-range affiliation of recovered sequences. Here we demonstrate the application of a genome signature-based approach to interrogate conventional whole-community metagenomes and access subliminal, phylogenetically targeted, phage sequences present within. We describe a portion of the biological dark matter extant in the human gut virome, and bring to light a population of potentially gut-specific Bacteroidales-like phage, poorly represented in existing virus like particle-derived viral metagenomes. These predominantly temperate phage were shown to encode functions of direct relevance to human health in the form of antibiotic resistance genes, and provided evidence for the existence of putative 'viral-enterotypes' among this fraction of the human gut virome.

(mbsulli@email.arizona.edu)									Genome Biology		2013		14	11	Article No.: R123	R123		English						Background: Marine ecosystem function is largely determined by matter and energy transformations mediated by microbial community interaction networks. Viral infection modulates network properties through mortality, gene transfer and metabolic reprogramming.Results: Here we explore the nature and extent of viral metabolic reprogramming throughout the Pacific Ocean depth continuum. We describe 35 marine viral gene families with potential to reprogram metabolic flux through central metabolic pathways recovered from Pacific Ocean waters. Four of these families have been previously reported but 31 are novel. These known and new carbon pathway auxiliary metabolic genes were recovered from a total of 22 viral metagenomes in which viral auxiliary metabolic genes were differentiated from low-level cellular DNA inputs based on small subunit ribosomal RNA gene content, taxonomy, fragment recruitment and genomic context information. Auxiliary metabolic gene distribution patterns reveal that marine viruses target overlapping, but relatively distinct pathways in sunlit and dark ocean waters to redirect host carbon flux towards energy production and viral genome replication under low nutrient, niche-differentiated conditions throughout the depth continuum.Conclusions: Given half of ocean microbes are infected by viruses at any given time, these findings of broad viral metabolic reprogramming suggest the need for renewed consideration of viruses in global ocean carbon models.

The sampling strategy was designed to be representative of the physico-chemical gradients of the water column of the lake, and of the seasonal variability as well, i.e. 12 different depths sampled in triplicates from April to December 2005. In the space, viral lytic activity estimated from the frequency of visibly infected prokaryotic cells and from burst size over the study period generally decreased with depth. This was viewed as a paradox compared to the abundances of viruses and prokaryotes and to the prokaryotic production which increased with depth. The seasonal variability in viral lytic activity was correlated with prokaryotic variables (abundance and production) in the deepest waters, i.e. from the hypolimnion downwards. Compared to previous studies known from the mixolimnion, we conclude that the deep waters in Lake Pavin represent an exclusive environment for heterotrophic prokaryotes whose seasonal activity offers an optimal and unique resource for thriving viral communities, some of which may be typical, endemic to the ambient dark, cold and stable deep water masses. Overall, the main findings in the present study get well around a previous statement that the ecology of the deepest waters of Lake Pavin is essentially driven by the dark viral loop (dissolved organic matter-prokaryotes-viruses) processes, which can sequester organic matters and nutrients for a long-lived turnover time. This is in agreement with recent demonstrations from marine systems that meso- and bathypelagic waters are optimal environments for viral survival and proliferation.

Despite this, knowledge of the ecology and composition of bacteriophage in the gut bacterial community remains poor, with few well characterized gut-associated phage genomes currently available. Here we describe the identification and in-depth (meta) genomic, proteomic, and ecological analysis of a human gut-specific bacteriophage (designated phi B124-14). In doing so we illuminate a fraction of the biological dark matter extant in this ecosystem and its surrounding eco-genomic landscape, identifying a novel and uncharted bacteriophage gene-space in this community. phi B124-14 infects only a subset of closely related gut-associated Bacteroides fragilis strains, and the circular genome encodes functions previously found to be rare in viral genomes and human gut viral metagenome sequences, including those which potentially confer advantages upon phage and/or host bacteria. Comparative genomic analyses revealed phi B124-14 is most closely related to phi B40-8, the only other publically available Bacteroides sp. phage genome, whilst comparative metagenomic analysis of both phage failed to identify any homologous sequences in 136 non-human gut metagenomic datasets searched, supporting the human gut-specific nature of this phage. Moreover, a potential geographic variation in the carriage of these and related phage was revealed by analysis of their distribution and prevalence within 151 human gut microbiomes and viromes from Europe, America and Japan. Finally, ecological profiling of phi B124-14 and phi B40-8, using both gene-centric alignment-driven phylogenetic analyses, as well as alignment-free gene-independent approaches was undertaken. This not only verified the human gut-specific nature of both phage, but also indicated that these phage populate a distinct and unexplored ecological landscape within the human gut microbiome.

It has been shown that bacteria, viruses and protozoan grazers are dominant in terms of abundance and biomass. The frequent interactions between these microbiological compartments are responsible for strong trophic links from dissolved organic matter to higher trophic levels, via heterotrophic bacteria, which form the basis for the important biogeochemical roles of microbial food webs in aquatic ecosystems. To gain a better understanding of the interactions between bacteria, viruses and flagellates in lacustrine ecosystems, we investigated the effect of protistan bacterivory on bacterial abundance, production and structure [determined by 16S rRNA PCR-DGGE], and viral abundance and activity of two lakes of contrasting trophic status. Four experiments were conducted in the oligotrophic Lake Annecy and the mesotrophic Lake Bourget over two seasons (early spring vs. summer) using a fractionation approach. In situ dark vs. light incubations were performed to consider the effects of the different treatments in the presence and absence of phototrophic activity.Results: The presence of grazers (i.e. < 5-mu m small eukaryotes) affected viral production positively in all experiments, and the stimulation of viral production (compared to the treatment with no eukaryotic predators) was more variable between lakes than between seasons, with the highest value having been recorded in the mesotrophic lake (+30%). Viral lysis and grazing activities acted additively to sustain high bacterial production in all experiments. Nevertheless, the stimulation of bacterial production was more variable between seasons than between lakes, with the highest values obtained in summer (+33.5% and +37.5% in Lakes Bourget and Annecy, respectively). The presence of both predators (nanoflagellates and viruses) did not seem to have a clear influence upon bacterial community structure according to the four experiments.Conclusions: Our results highlight the importance of a synergistic effect, i.e. the positive influence of grazers on viral activities in sustaining (directly and indirectly) bacterial production and affecting composition, in both oligotrophic and mesotrophic lakes.

Although this perspective has begun to change since genome-wide transcriptional profiling was successfully extended to evolutionary biology, it still echoes in evolutionary literature. In this mini-review, new developments of RNA biochemistry and transcriptomics are brought to the attention of evolutionary biologists. In particular, the unexpected abundance and functional significance of noncoding RNAs is briefly reviewed. Noncoding RNAs control a remarkable range of biological pathways and processes, all with obvious fitness consequences, such as initiation of translation, mRNA abundance, transposon jumping, chromosome architecture, stem cell maintenance, development of brain and muscles, insulin secretion, cancerogenesis and plant resistance to viral infections.

Reactivation of the latent virus causes recurrent infections which may lead to a loss of retinal architecture in study animals. While HSV has been suggested to play a role in the development of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), its pathogenesis has been unclear due to two reasons: ARN is rare and no specific viral antigens or peptideshave been identified. The purpose of this study was to identify any viral antigen or peptide in latently infected rabbit eyes.Methods: Study rabbits (20/group) were topically inoculated with either an HSV-1 mutant or the wild type virus strains at 2 X 10(5) PFU/eye. 5 control rabbits were inoculated with culture media only. Rabbits surviving at least 30 days post infection (PI) were visually assessed daily by external, unaided examination, and the appearance of their eyes was recorded for 26 consecutive days. At 56 days PI, all rabbit eyes were enucleated, formalin. fixed, paraffin-embedded, and sectioned for H&E staining and immunohistochemical studies.Results: A high percentage (75%) of rabbit eyes infected with the mutant strain developed observable "dark pupils". Their histology revealed that the retinafrom these eyes was remarkably thin and consistently lost. In contrast, the morphologies of the retina in control eyes and wild type infected eyes were grossly intact. Using immunohistochemical studies, we observed that in one of themutant-infected rabbit eyes with a preserved retinal architecture, an HSV antigen was detected in the inner and outer plexiform layers ( Figure 1).Conclusions: The identification of an HSV antigen suggests a relationship of HSV-1 to the loss in retinal architecture. This study further suggests that detection may be antigen-specific and a matter of timing.					0	0		0	0	0			Infectious Diseases; Neurosciences & Neurology	0146-0404				Infection; Sense Organs (Sensory Reception)	00520, General biology - Symposia, transactions and proceedings; 20004, Sense organs - Physiology and biochemistry; 20006, Sense organs - Pathology; 33502, Virology - General and methods; 36006, Medical and clinical microbiology - Virology	dsDNA Viruses, Viruses, Microorganisms; Double-Stranded DNA Viruses, Microorganisms, Viruses; Herpesviridae [03115]; [Herpes simplex virus type 1; Human herpesvirus 1; (pathogen)]/Lagomorpha, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Lagomorphs, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Leporidae [86040]; [rabbit; (host)]	herpes simplex virus-1 infection; Herpes Simplex (MeSH); viral disease/acute retinal necrosis; Retinal Necrosis Syndrome, Acute (MeSH); eye disease	herpes simplex virus-type 1 antigen						retina; sensory system/eye; sensory system/pupil; sensory system/plexiform layer; sensory system					2020-10-14
